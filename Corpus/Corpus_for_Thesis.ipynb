However, when m-cresol was the growth substrate, similar experiments suggested a different pathway involving a methyl-substituted catechol, and ring-fission by meta cleavage. Assays of ring-fission enzymes in cell-free extracts confirmed that different pathways are induced by the two growth substrates. 3, 5-Xylenol-grown cells contained high levels of \\tO\\ngentisate oxygenase\\tenzyme\\n and only very small amounts of \\tO\\ncatechol oxygenase\\tenzyme\\n, whereas gentisate ocygenase could not be detected in m-cresol-grown cells, but levels of \\tO\\ncatechol oxygenase\\tenzyme\\n were greatly increased. Extracts of m-cresol-grown cells also contained \\tO\\n2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase\\tenzyme\\n and hydrolase, whose specificities enable them to metabolize the ring-fission products from catechol, 3-methylcatechol, and 4-methylcatechol. This catechol pathway is also used by m-cresol-grown cells for p-cresol metabolism.

Trichloroethene (TCE) could be reductively dechlorinated to ethene with up to 95% efficiency as long as the pH-increase effects of methanogens and homoacetogens were managed and dechlorinators were selected for during start-up by creating H(2) limitation. Based on quantitative PCR, the dominant bacterial groups in the biofilm at the end of reactor operation were Dehalococcoides, Geobacter, and homoacetogens. Pyrosequencing confirmed the dominance of the dechlorinators and identified Acetobacterium as the key homoacetogen. Homoacetogens outcompeted methanogens for bicarbonate, based on the effluent concentration of acetate, by suppressing methanogens during batch start-up. This was corroborated by the methanogenesis functional gene mcrA, which was 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than the \\tO\\nFTHFS\\tgene\\n functional gene for homoacetogens. Imaging of the MBfR fibers using scanning electron microscopy showed a distinct Dehalococcoides-like morphology in the fiber biofilm. These results support that direct addition of H(2) can allow for efficient and complete reductive dechlorination, and they shed light into how H(2)-fed biofilms, when operated to manage methanogenic and homoacetogenic activity, can be used for ex-situ bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

DPA formation from phenanthrene was somewhat greater in low-nitrogen (ligninolytic) cultures than in high-nitrogen (nonligninolytic) cultures and did not occur in uninoculated cultures. The oxidation of PQ to DPA involved both fungal and abiotic mechanisms, was unaffected by the level of nitrogen added, and was significantly faster than the cleavage of phenanthrene to DPA. Phenanthrene-trans-9,10-dihydrodiol, which was previously shown to be the principal phenanthrene metabolite in nonligninolytic P. chrysosporium cultures, was not formed in the ligninolytic cultures employed here. These results suggest that phenanthrene degradation by ligninolytic P. chrysosporium proceeds in order from phenanthrene----PQ----DPA, involves both ligninolytic and nonligninolytic enzymes, and is not initiated by a classical microsomal cytochrome P-450. The extracellular \\tO\\nlignin peroxidase\\tenzyme\\ns of P. chrysosporium were not able to oxidize phenanthrene in vitro and therefore are also unlikely to catalyze the first step of phenanthrene degradation in vivo.

In a first screening, 18 different compounds were tested for degradation with the cultures as well as with four pure methane-oxidizing bacterial (MOB) strains. The tested compounds included pharmaceuticals, chemical additives, pesticides, and their degradation products. All enriched cultures were successful in the degradation of at least four different pollutants, but the compounds degraded most often were sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and benzotriazole (BTZ). Addition of acetylene, a specific \\tO\\nmethane monooxygenase\\tenzyme\\n (MMO) inhibitor, revealed that SMX and BTZ were mainly degraded co-metabolically by the present MOB. The pure MOB cultures exhibited less degradation potential, while SMX and BTZ were also degraded by three of the four tested pure strains. For MOB, copper (Cu(2+)) concentration is often an important factor, as several species have the ability to express a soluble MMO (sMMO) if the Cu(2+) concentration is low. In literature, this enzyme is often described to have a broader compound range for co-metabolic degradation of pollutants, in particular when it comes to aromatic structures.

The organism contains \\tO\\n2-aminobenzoate-coenzyme A ligase\\tenzyme\\n (\\tO\\n2-aminobenzoate-CoA ligase\\tenzyme\\n), which forms 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA. 2-Aminobenzoyl-CoA is then reductively deaminated to benzoyl-CoA by an oxygen-sensitive enzyme, 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA reductase (deaminating), which requires a low potential reductant [Ti(III)]. The specific activity is 15 nmol of 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA reduced min-1 mg-1 of protein at an optimal pH of 7. The two enzymes are induced by the substrate under anaerobic conditions only. Benzoyl-CoA is further converted in vitro by reduction with Ti(III) to six products; the same products are formed when benzoyl-CoA or 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA is incubated under reducing conditions. Two of them were identified preliminarily. One product is cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA, the other is trans-2-hydroxycyclohexane-carboxyl-CoA. The complex transformation of benzoyl-CoA is ascribed to at least two enzymes, \\tO\\nbenzoyl-CoA reductase\\tenzyme\\n (aromatic ring reducing) and \\tO\\ncyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA hydratase\\tenzyme\\n. The reduction of benzoyl-CoA to alicyclic compounds is catalyzed by extracts from cells grown anaerobically on either 2-aminobenzoate or benzoate at almost the same rate (10 to 15 nmol min-1 mg-1 of protein). In contrast, extracts from cells grown anaerobically on acetate or grown aerobically on benzoate or 2-aminobenzoate are inactive. This suggests a sequential induction of the enzymes.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

Slow-release inoculation of Sphingomonas sp. gamma 1-7 was established in both liquid and soil slurry microcosms using open-ended silicone tubes in which the bacteria are encapsulated in a protective nutrient-rich matrix. The capacity of the encapsulated cells to degrade lindane under aerobic conditions was evaluated in comparison with inoculation of free-living cells. Encapsulation of cells in tubes caused the removal of lindane by adsorption to the silicone tubes but also ensured prolonged biodegradation activity. Lindane degradation persisted 2.2 and 1.4 times longer for liquid and soil slurry microcosms, respectively, than that for inoculation with free cells. While inoculation of free-living cells led to a loss in lindane-degrading activity in limited time intervals, encapsulation in tubes allowed for a more stable actively degrading community. The loss in degrading activity was linked to the loss of the \\tO\\nlinA\\tgene\\n gene, encoding gamma-\\tO\\nHCH dehydrochlorinase\\tenzyme\\n (\\tO\\nLinA\\tgene\\n), which is involved in the initial steps of the lindane degradation pathway.

All MerAs have a C-terminal extension about 15 residues long but have very varied N termini. Although the enzyme from Streptomyces lividans has no addition, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Tn501 and Bacillus sp. strain RC607 it has one and two copies respectively of a domain of 80-85 residues, highly homologous to MerP, the periplasmic component of proteins encoded by the mer operon. These domains can be proteolytically cleaved off without changing the catalytic efficiency. We report here the crystal structure of \\tO\\nMerA\\tgene\\n from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus sp. strain RC607. Analysis of its complexes with nicotinamide dinucleotide substrates and the inhibitor Cd(II) reveals how limited structural changes enable an enzyme to accept as substrate what used to be a dangerous inhibitor.

Notwithstanding, the potential effects on soil ecosystems remain largely unexplored. In this study, the effects of polyethylene microplastics on soil enzymatic activities and the bacterial community were evaluated, and the microbiota colonizing on microplastics were also investigated. Microplastic amendment (2000 fragments per kg soil) significantly increased the \\tO\\nurease\\tenzyme\\n and \\tO\\ncatalase\\tenzyme\\n activities in soil after 15 days, and no discernible alteration of \\tO\\ninvertase\\tenzyme\\n activities was detected. Results from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that the alpha diversities (richness, evenness, and diversity) of the microbiota in soil were not obviously changed by the PE amendment, whereas the diversity indexes of microbiota on plastic fragments were significantly lower than those in the control and amended soils. Different taxonomic composition was observed in between the control and amended soils after 90 days of incubation. Bacterial assemblages with distinct community structure colonized the PE microplastics. Additionally, several taxa including plastic-degrading bacteria and pathogens were more abundant on microplastics. Simultaneously, the predicted functional profiles showed that the pathways of amino acid metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were higher on the microplastics. These results indicated that microplastics in soil, compared with those in aquatic environments, can also act as a distinct microbial habitat, potentially altering the ecological functions of soil ecosystems.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

The proposed pathway initiates with hydrolysis of linuron to 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA) and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine, followed by conversion of DCA to Krebs cycle intermediates. Differential proteomic analysis showed a linuron-dependent upregulation of several enzymes that fit into this pathway, including an \\tO\\namidase\\tenzyme\\n (\\tO\\nLibA\\tgene\\n), a multicomponent chloroaniline dioxygenase, and enzymes associated with a modified chlorocatechol ortho-cleavage pathway.

This novel member of the \\tO\\namidase\\tenzyme\\n signature family is unrelated to phenylurea-hydrolyzing enzymes from Gram-positive bacteria and lacks activity toward other tested phenylurea herbicides. Orthologues of \\tO\\nlibA\\tgene\\n are present in all other tested linuron-degrading Variovorax strains with the exception of Variovorax strains WDL1 and PBS-H4, suggesting divergent evolution of the linuron catabolic pathway in different Variovorax strains.

Transcription analysis suggests that a catabolic intermediate, rather than linuron itself, acts as effector in activation of the pathway.

The cell extract was fractionated into two DCP-dechlorinating activities (fractions Ia and Ib) and two ECH-hydrolyzing activities (fractions IIa and IIb) by TSKgel DEAE-5PW column chromatography. Fractions Ia and Ib catalyzed the interconversion of DCP to ECH, and fractions IIa and IIb catalyzed the transformation of ECH into MCP. Fractions Ia and IIa showed only low enantioselectivity for each reaction, whereas fractions Ib and IIb exhibited considerable enantioselectivity, yielding R-rich ECH and MCP, respectively. Enzymes Ia and Ib were isolated from fractions Ia and Ib, respectively. Enzyme Ia had a molecular mass of about 108 kDa and consisted of four subunits identical in molecular mass (about 28 kDa). Enzyme Ib was a protein of 115 kDa, composed of two different polypeptides (about 35 and 32 kDa). The specific activity of enzyme Ib for DCP was about 30-fold higher than that of enzyme Ia. Both enzymes catalyzed the transformation of several halohydrins into the corresponding epoxides with liberation of halides and its reverse reaction.

Although certain PAHs are oxidized in vitro by the fungal \\tO\\nlignin peroxidase\\tenzyme\\ns (LiPs) that catalyze ligninolysis, it has never been shown that LiPs initiate PAH degradation in vivo. To address these problems, the metabolism of anthracene (AC) and its in vitro oxidation product, 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ), was examined by chromatographic and isotope dilution techniques in Phanerochaete chrysosporium. The fungal oxidation of AC to AQ was rapid, and both AC and AQ were significantly mineralized. Both compounds were cleaved by the fungus to give the same ring-fission metabolite, phthalic acid, and phthalate production from AQ was shown to occur only under ligninolytic culture conditions. These results show that the major pathway for AC degradation in Phanerochaete proceeds AC----AQ----phthalate + CO2 and that it is probably mediated by LiPs and other enzymes of ligninolytic metabolism.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

The most purified preparation showed a single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide disc gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of 38,000. The apparent molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by Sephadex G-200 column chromatography was 150,000. Among the substrate analogs tested, only 4-hydroxyphthalate served as a substrate, which was decarboxylated to form m-hydroxybenzoate. The apparent Km values for 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate and 4-hydroxyphthalate were estimated to be 10.5 micrometer and 1.25 mM, respectively, and the Vmax for the former was 10 times larger than that for the latter.

The initial step of the pathway is hydroxylation of toluene to form p-cresol by a multicomponent \\tO\\ntoluene-4-monooxygenase\\tenzyme\\n (T4MO) system. The T4MO enzyme system has broad substrate specificity and provides a new opportunity for biodegradation of toxic compounds and bioconversions. Its known activities include conversion of a variety of phenyl compounds into the phenolic derivatives and the complete degradation of trichloroethylene. We have cloned and characterized a gene cluster from KR1 that determines the offO activity. To clone the T4MO genes, KR1 DNA libraries were constructed in Escherichia coli HB101 by using a broad-host-range vector and transferred to a KR1 mutant able to grow on p-cresol but not on toluene. An insert consisting of two SacI fragments of identical size (10.2 kb) was shown to complement the mutant for growth on toluene. One of the SacI fragments, when cloned into the E. coli vector pUC19, was found to direct the synthesis of indigo dye. The indigo-forming property was correlated with the presence of T4MO activity. The T4MO genes were mapped to a 3.6-kb region, and the direction of transcription was determined. DNA sequencing and N-terminal amino acid determination identified a five-gene cluster, \\tO\\ntmoABCDE\\tgene\\n, within this region. Expression of this cluster carrying a single mutation in each gene demonstrated that each of the five genes is essential for T4MO activity. Other evidence presented indicated that none of the tmo genes was involved in the regulation of the tmo gene cluster, in the control of substrate transport for the T4MO system, or in major processing of the products of the tmo genes. It was tentatively concluded that the \\tO\\ntmoABCDE\\tgene\\n genes encode structural polypeptides of the T4MO enzyme system.

Genetic studies have suggested that this monooxygenase consists of two different proteins, products of the \\tO\\nxylA\\tgene\\n and \\tO\\nxylM\\tgene\\n genes, which function as an electron-transfer protein and a terminal hydroxylase, respectively. In this study, the electron-transfer component of \\tO\\nxylene monooxygenase\\tenzyme\\n, the product of \\tO\\nxylA\\tgene\\n, was purified to homogeneity. Fractions containing the \\tO\\nxylA\\tgene\\n gene product were identified by its NADH:cytochrome c reductase activity. The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined to be 40 kDa by SDS/PAGE, and 42 kDa by gel filtration. The enzyme was found to contain 1 mol/mol of tightly but not covalently bound FAD, as well as 2 mol/mol of non-haem iron and 2 mol/mol of acid-labile sulfide, suggesting the presence of two redox centers, one FAD and one [2Fe-2S] cluster/protein molecule. The oxidised form of the protein had absorbance maxima at 457 nm and 390 nm, with shoulders at 350 nm and 550 nm. These absorbance maxima disappeared upon reduction of the protein by NADH or dithionite. The NADH:acceptor reductase was capable of reducing either one- or two-electron acceptors, such as horse heart cytochrome c or 2,6-dichloroindophenol, at an optimal pH of 8.5. The reductase was found to have a Km value for NADH of 22 microM. The oxidation of NADH was determined to be stereospecific; the enzyme is pro-R (class A enzyme). The titration of the reductase with NADH or dithionite yielded three distinct reduced forms of the enzyme: the reduction of the [2Fe-2S] center occurred with a midpoint redox potential of -171 mV; and the reduction of FAD to FAD. (semiquinone form), with a calculated midpoint redox potential of -244 mV. The reduction of FAD. to FAD.. (dihydroquinone form), the last stage of the titration, occurred with a midpoint redox potential of -297 mV. The [2Fe-2S] center could be removed from the protein by treatment with an excess of mersalyl acid. The [2Fe-2S]-depleted protein was still reduced by NADH, giving rise to the formation of the anionic flavin semiquinone observed in the native enzyme, thus suggesting that the electron flow was NADH --> FAD --> [2Fe-2S] in this reductase. The resulting protein could no longer reduce cytochrome c, but could reduce 2,6-dichloroindophenol at a reduced rate.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

This compound was shown to be the only major product formed from 3-fluoro-cis,cis-muconate by the action of \\tO\\nmuconate cycloisomerases\\tenzyme\\n from A. eutrophus 335, A. eutrophus JMP134, and P. cepacia as well as by the action of \\tO\\ndichloromuconate cycloisomerase\\tenzyme\\n from A. eutrophus JMP134. This finding implies that \\tO\\ndichloromuconate cycloisomerase\\tenzyme\\n, like the \\tO\\nmuconate cycloisomerases\\tenzyme\\n, catalyzes primarily a cycloisomerization reaction, which only in the case of chloro- and bromo-substituted substrates is connected to a dehalogenation. 4-Fluoromuconolactone at pH 7 decomposes by spontaneous reactions mainly to maleylacetate, which then decarboxylates to give cis-acetylacrylate. Although significant amounts of an unidentified compound are also formed from the fluorolactone, HF elimination to the two isomeric dienelactones (4-carboxymethylenebut-2-en-4-olides) is negligible. However, all spontaneous reactions proceed so slowly that an enzymatic conversion of 4-fluoromuconolactone must be assumed. Participation of \\tO\\ndienelactone hydrolases\\tenzyme\\n in this reaction is indicated by their induction during growth of various strains with 4-fluorobenzoate. However, experiments with cell extracts of P. putida A3.12 suggest that at least one other hydrolytic enzyme is able to contribute to 4-fluoromuconolactone conversion. In light of these observations, earlier proposals for a 4-fluorobenzoate degradative pathway are discussed.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

Enzyme stability is maintained by the addition of ethanol, EDTA, and dithiothreitol. Stoichiometric studies show that for 1 mol of undecyl acetate formed, 1 mol of O2 is consumed and 1 mol of NADPH is oxidized. The monooxygenase, purified to homogeneity, has a molecular weight of approximately 123,000 and consists of two equal subunits with molecular weights of 55,000. The enzyme contains FAD and exhibits absorption maxima at 375 and 488 nm. Enzyme activity is inhibited by thiol-active reagents and the inhibition by the cations, cadmium, copper, zinc, and mercury, is reversed by dithiothreitol, indicating the presence of essential sulfhydryl groups. Substrate specificity tests show that acetate esters are formed from methyl ketones from C-7 through C-14. The oxygenase is also active on isomers of 2-tridecanone forming esters from 3- through 7-tridecanone. With 6-tridecanone, two esters are formed, heptyl hexanoate and pentyl octanoate, indicating that oxygen is inserted on either side of the carbonyl group. In addition, the enzyme catalyzes the lactonization of the cyclic ketone, cyclopentanone, with the formation of 5-valerolactone.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

Atrazine is the most widely used s-triazine herbicide for the control of weeds in crops such as corn and sorghum. Although atrazine was initially found to be slowly and partially biodegradable, predominantly by nonspecific \\tO\\nP450 monoxygenase\\tenzyme\\ns which do not sustain microbial growth, microorganisms gradually evolved as a result of repeated exposure, started using it as a growth substrate and eventually succeeded in mineralizing it.

GY2B during phenanthrene biodegradation in the presence and absence of a nonionic surfactant, Tween80. A total of 23 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated proteins were detected upon Tween80 treatment. Tween80 could regulate ion transport (e.g. H+) in cell membrane to provide driving force (ATP) for the transmembrane transport of phenanthrene thus increasing its uptake and biodegradation by GY2B. Moreover, Tween80 probably increased GY2B vitality and growth by inducing the expression of \\tO\\npeptidylprolyl isomerase\\tenzyme\\n to stabilize cell membrane, increasing the abundances of proteins involved in intracellular metabolic pathways (e.g. TCA cycle), as well as decreasing the abundances of translation/transcription-related proteins and cysteine desulfurase, thereby facilitating phenanthrene biodegradation.

We employed three different cultural conditions: (1) a culture sequentially fed a high concentration (300 mg/L) of 2,4-D (HS); (2) a culture continuously fed a low concentration (10 mg/L) of 2,4-D (LC); and (3) a serial batch culture in which 1% (v/v) of culture was transferred to a fresh medium containing a high concentration (300 mg/L) of 2,4-D (HB). The HS and LC bioreactors were operated for 3 months and HB was repeatedly transferred for 1 month. The 2,4-D was stably degraded under all the cultural conditions tested. PCR amplification and cloning-based analysis of functional genes using community DNAs from the cultures revealed five different \\tO\\noxygenase\\tenzyme\\n genes that may be involved in the initial step of 2,4-D degradation. All five gene-types were present in HS, while one of the five genes, type V (\\tO\\ntftA\\tgene\\n) was not detected in LC. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that in HS, Ralstonia eutropha JMP 134 type-\\tO\\ntfdA4\\tgene\\n (type I) was the most abundant in copy number (2.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(7) copies/microg DNA) followed by RASC type-\\tO\\ntfdA\\tgene\\n (type II) (1.8 +/- 1.0 x 10(6) copies/microg DNA), putative \\tO\\ncadA\\tgene\\n-like gene (type IV) (2.6 +/- 0.8 x 10(5) copies/microg DNA), \\tO\\ncadA\\tgene\\n gene (type III) (1.3 +/- 1.0 x 10(4) copies/microg DNA), and \\tO\\ntftA\\tgene\\n gene (type V) (3.5 +/- 1.1 x 10(3) copies/microg DNA). Similar results were obtained in LC. In contrast, HB contained only type I and type III genes, and the type I gene was five orders of magnitude greater in copy number than the type III gene. Denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR, amplified 16S rDNA fragments of bacterial communities in the three different cultures showed low similarity coefficient values (< or =0.35) when compared to the original activated sludge, suggesting that 2,4-D amendment caused a drastic change in the bacterial community. Particularly, HB showed only six bands (16-18 bands in the other cultures) and very low similarity coefficient values when compared to the other communities (0.10 to HS, 0.17 to LC, and 0.0 to original sludge). These results indicated that serial batch culturing (HB) resulted in a phylogenetically limited number of 2,4-D degrading bacteria carrying limited catabolic genes whereas more diverse 2,4-D degraders and catabolic genes were present in HS and LC. Therefore, the approach used for monitoring should be taken into account when one evaluates the population dynamics of contaminant-degrading bacteria at bioremediation sites.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

C. youngae E4 poorly degraded TNT without an exogenous amino nitrogen source, whereas the addition of an amino nitrogen source considerably increased the efficacy of TNT transformation in a dose-dependent manner. The enhanced TNT transformation of C. youngae E4 was mediated by increased cell growth and up-regulation of \\tO\\nTNT nitroreductase\\tenzyme\\ns, including NemA, NfsA and NfsB. This result indicates that the increase in TNT transformation by C. youngae E4 via nitrogen nutrient stimulation is a cometabolism process. Consistently, TNT transformation was effectively enhanced when C. youngae E4 was subjected to a TNT-contaminated soil slurry in the presence of an exogenous amino nitrogen amendment. Thus, effective enhancement of TNT transformation via the coordinated inoculation of the nutrient-responsive C. youngae E4 and an exogenous nitrogen amendment might be applicable for the remediation of TNT-contaminated soil. Although the TNT transformation was significantly enhanced by C. youngae E4 in concert with biostimulation, the 96-h LC50 value of the TNT transformation product mixture on the aquatic invertebrate Tigriopus japonicas was higher than the LC50 value of TNT alone. Our results suggest that exogenous nutrient amendment can enhance microbial TNT transformation; however, additional detoxification processes may be needed due to the increased toxicity after reduced TNT transformation.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

These observations suggested a major route of methylbenzoate metabolism to be dioxygenation to a carboxy-hydrodiol which then forms a catechol derivative. In addition, the methyl group of 2-methylbenzoate was oxidized to isobenzofuranone (by cells of MB2-G5) and to phthalate (by cells of a separate mutant that could not utilize phthalate, MB2-D2).

Here, the degradative pathway for atrazine was examined for a complex 8-membered enrichment culture. The species composition of the culture was determined by PCR-DGGE. The bacterial species included Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas putida, Sphingomonas yaniokuyae, Nocardia sp., Rhizobium sp., Flavobacterium oryzihabitans, and Variovorax paradoxus. All of the isolates were screened for the presence of known genes that function for atrazine degradation including \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n,-B,-C,-D,-E,-F and \\tO\\ntrzD\\tgene\\n,-N. Dechlorination of atrazine, which was obligatory for complete mineralization, was carried out exclusively by Nocardia sp., which contained the trzN gene. Following dechlorination, the resulting product, hydroxyatrazine was further degraded via two separate pathways. In one pathway Nocardia converted hydroxyatrazine to N-ethylammelide via an unidentified gene product. In the second pathway, hydroxyatrazine generated by Nocardia sp. was hydrolyzed to N-isopropylammelide by Rhizobium sp., which contained the atzB gene. Each member of the enrichment culture contained \\tO\\natzC\\tgene\\n, which is responsible for ring cleavage, but none of the isolates carried the \\tO\\natzD\\tgene\\n,-E, or -F genes.

In aromatic compound-degrading anaerobic bacteria the central intermediate of aromatic catabolism, benzoyl coenzyme A, is attacked by dearomatizing \\tO\\nbenzoyl-CoA reductase\\tenzyme\\ns (BCRs). An ATP-dependent BCR has been characterized in facultative anaerobes. In contrast, a previous analysis of the soluble proteome from the obligately anaerobic model organism Geobacter metallireducens identified genes putatively coding for a completely different dearomatizing BCR. The corresponding BamBCDEFGHI complex is predicted to comprise soluble molybdenum or tungsten, selenocysteine, and FeS cluster-containing components. To elucidate key processes involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds in obligately anaerobic bacteria, differential membrane protein abundance levels from G. metallireducens grown on benzoate and acetate were determined by the MS-based spectral counting approach. A total of 931 proteins were identified by combining one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Due to the increasing amount of rubber waste, biotechnical methods to degrade that particular waste are strongly needed. The present study evaluates whether a microbial or an enzymatic process is more suitable for efficient biodegradation, due to less sensitivity towards rubber additives. Therefore we investigated the impact of 15 different frequently used rubber additives on cells of the potent rubber degrader Gordonia polyisoprenivorans VH2 and the enzyme \\tO\\nLcp1VH2\\tenzyme\\n. For this, cells were grown on poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) in presence of these rubber additives. Furthermore, the effect of those additives on the enzymatic cleavage of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) by \\tO\\nLcp1VH2\\tenzyme\\n was determined by in vitro studies. It was observed that additives, used to accelerate the vulcanization process, like N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide and zinc-bis(N,N-dibenzyl-dithiocarbamate), are diminishing the growth of the microorganism depending on their concentration-higher toxicity with increasing concentration. In contrast, sulfur prevents cell growth, but does not affect \\tO\\nLcp1VH2\\tenzyme\\n. Stearic acid and paraffin wax were found to be consumed by G. polyisoprenivorans VH2.

It was found that the in vitro degradation by \\tO\\nLcp1VH2\\tenzyme\\n is much more resistant and less sensitive towards the investigated rubber additives, when compared to the in vivo approach.

Bioremediation is an ecologically sound method to manage soil pollution, but the bottleneck here, is the successful scale-up of lab-scale experiments to field applications. This study demonstrates pilot-scale bioremediation in tropical soil using atrazine as model pollutant. Mimicking field conditions, three different bioremediation strategies for atrazine degradation were explored. 100 kg soil mesocosms were set-up, with or without atrazine application history. Natural attenuation and enhanced bioremediation were tested, where augmentation with an atrazine degrading consortium demonstrated best pollutant removal. 90% atrazine degradation was observed in six days in soil previously exposed to atrazine, while soil without history of atrazine use, needed 15 days to remove the same amount of amended atrazine. The bacterial consortium comprised of 3 novel bacterial strains with different genetic atrazine degrading potential. The progress of bioremediation was monitored by measuring the levels of atrazine and its intermediate, cyanuric acid.

The carcinogenic properties of PAHs are the main causes of harm to human health. The green technology, biodegradation have become convenient options to address the environmental pollution. In this study, we analyzed the biodegradation potential of naphthalene with secondary carbon supplements (SCSs) in carbon deficient media (CSM) by Pseudomonas putida strain KD9 isolated from oil refinerary waste. The rigid-flexible molecular docking method revealed that the mutated naphthalene \\tO\\n1,2-dioxygenase\\tenzyme\\n had lower affinity for naphthalene than that found in wild type strain. Moreover, analytical methods (HPLC, qRT-PCR) and soft agar chemotaxis suggest sucrose (0.5\\xe2\\x80\\xafwt%) to be the best chemo-attractant and it unequivocally caused enhanced biodegradation of naphthalene (500\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg\\xe2\\x80\\xafL-1) in both biofilm-mediated and shake-flask biodegradation methods. In addition, the morphological analysis detected from microscopy clearly showed KD9 to change its size and shape (rod to pointed) during biodegradation of naphthalene in CSM as sole source of carbon and energy. The forward versus side light scatter plot of the singlet cells obtained from flow cytometry suggests smaller cell size in CSM and lower florescence intensity of the total DNA content of cells.

The \\tO\\nhylA\\tgene\\n gene was identified in a draft genome sequence of strain WDL1. The involvement of \\tO\\nhylA\\tgene\\n in linuron degradation by strain WDL1 is inferred from its absence in spontaneous WDL1 mutants defective in linuron hydrolysis and its presence in linuron-degrading Variovorax strains that lack \\tO\\nlibA\\tgene\\n. In strain WDL1, the \\tO\\nhylA\\tgene\\n gene is combined with catabolic gene modules encoding the downstream pathways for DCA degradation, which are very similar to those present in Variovorax sp. SRS16, which contains \\tO\\nlibA\\tgene\\n. Our results show that the expansion of a DCA catabolic pathway toward linuron degradation in Variovorax can involve different but isofunctional linuron hydrolysis genes encoding proteins that belong to evolutionary unrelated hydrolase families. This may be explained by divergent evolution and the independent acquisition of the corresponding genetic modules.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

The pathways of atrazine biodegradation have been elucidated but in situ expression of the genes involved in atrazine degradation has yet to be demonstrated in soil. Expression of the \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n and \\tO\\natzD\\tgene\\n genes involved in atrazine dechlorination and s-triazine ring cleavage, respectively, was investigated during in situ degradation of atrazine in the soil drilosphere and bulked samples from two agricultural soils that differed in their ability to mineralize atrazine. Interestingly, expression of the \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n gene, although present in both soils, was not detected. Atrazine mineralization was greatest in Epoisses soil, where a larger pool of \\tO\\natzD\\tgene\\n mRNA was consistently measured 7 days after atrazine treatment, compared with Vezin soil (146 vs. 49 mRNA per 10(6)16S rRNA, respectively). Expression of the \\tO\\natzD\\tgene\\n gene varied along the degradation time course and was profoundly modified in soil bioturbated by earthworms. The \\tO\\natzD\\tgene\\n mRNA pool was the highest in the soil drilosphere (casts and burrow-linings) and it was significantly different in burrow-linings compared with bulk soil (e.g. 363 vs. 146 mRNA per 10(6)16S rRNA, 7 days after atrazine treatment in Epoisses soil). Thus, consistent differences in atrazine mineralization were demonstrated between the soil drilosphere and bulk soil. However, the impact of bioturbation on atrazine mineralization depended on soil type. Mineralization was enhanced in casts, compared with bulk soil, from Epoisses soil but in burrow-linings from Vezin soil. This study is the first to report the effects of soil bioturbation by earthworms on s-triazine ring cleavage and its spatial variability in soil.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

The bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP (P. ADP) possesses genes encoding atrazine mineralization on the self-transmissible plasmid pADP-1. In the present study, this ability of the strain to mineralize atrazine in aquifer sediment under both aerobic and denitrifying conditions at 10 degrees C was studied. P. ADP was able to mineralize more than 50% of 2.8 muM atrazine within 14 days under both growth conditions. Counts of degraders as colony forming units (CFU) on atrazine plates and counts of \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n gene copies as determined by quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) were performed. The \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n gene encodes the enzyme which catalyzes the first step of atrazine mineralization by the strain.

High nitrate concentrations inhibited atrazine mineralization and culturability on agar plates, but \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n copy numbers remained stable throughout the experiment.

The present work reveals that Y57 degrades propanil via the following pathway: propanil was initially hydrolyzed to 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) and then converted to 4,5-dichlorocatechol, which was then subjected to aromatic ring cleavage and further processing. N-acylation and N-deacylation of 3,4-DCA also occurred, and among N-acylation products, 3,4-dichloropropionanilide was found for the first time.

Rather, metal ions appear to catalyze the heterolytic cleavage of peroxynitrite to form a nitronium-like species (NO2+). The calculated energy for separating peroxynitrous acid into hydroxide ion and nitronium ion is 13 kcal.mol-1 at pH 7.0. Fe3+EDTA catalyzed nitration with an activation energy of 12 kcal.mol-1 at a rate of 5700 M-1.s-1 at 37 degrees C and pH 7.5.

It is a xenobiotic compound which has accumulated in the environment for more than 50 years due to its global industrial usage and can cause negative effects on the environment. Isophthalate degradation by the strictly anaerobic S. aromaticivorans was investigated to advance our understanding of the degradation of xenobiotics introduced into nature, and to identify enzymes that might have ecological significance for bioremediation. Differential proteome analysis of isophthalate- vs benzoate-grown cells revealed over 400 differentially expressed proteins of which only four were unique to isophthalate-grown cells.

These proteins are encoded by genes forming a single gene cluster that putatively codes for anaerobic conversion of isophthalate to benzoyl-CoA. Subsequently, benzoyl-CoA is metabolized by the enzymes of the anaerobic benzoate degradation pathway that were identified in the proteomic analysis. In vitro enzyme assays with cell-free extracts of isophthalate-grown cells indicated that isophthalate is activated to isophthalyl-CoA by an ATP-dependent isophthalate:\\tO\\nCoA ligase\\tenzyme\\n (IPCL), and subsequently decarboxylated to benzoyl-CoA by a \\tO\\nUbiD family isophthalyl-CoA decarboxylase\\tenzyme\\n (IPCD) that requires a prenylated flavin mononucleotide (prFMN) cofactor supplied by \\tO\\nUbiX\\tgene\\n to effect decarboxylation.

Homologs of the IPCD encoding genes are found in several other bacteria, such as aromatic compound-degrading denitrifiers, marine sulfate-reducers, and methanogenic communities in a terephthalate-degrading reactor.

Strain MSH1 Biofilms under Carbon Starvation Conditions.\\tO\\n\\nAbstract\\tO\\n\\nAminobacter sp. strain MSH1 grows on and mineralizes the groundwater micropollutant 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) and is of interest for BAM removal in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). The BAM-catabolic genes in MSH1 are located on plasmid \\tO\\npBAM1\\tgene\\n, carrying \\tO\\nbbdA\\tgene\\n, which encodes the conversion of BAM to 2,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (2,6-DCBA) (\\tO\\nBbdA\\tgene\\n+ phenotype), and plasmid \\tO\\npBAM2\\tgene\\n, carrying gene clusters encoding the conversion of 2,6-DCBA to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (Dcba+ phenotype). There are indications that MSH1 easily loses its BAM-catabolic phenotype. We obtained evidence that MSH1 rapidly develops a population that lacks the ability to mineralize BAM when grown on nonselective (R2B medium) and semiselective (R2B medium with BAM) media. Lack of mineralization was explained by loss of the Dcba+ phenotype and corresponding genes. The ecological significance of this instability for the use of MSH1 for BAM removal in the oligotrophic environment of DWTPs was explored in lab and pilot systems. A higher incidence of \\tO\\nBbdA\\tgene\\n+ Dcba- MSH1 cells was also observed when MSH1 was grown as a biofilm in flow chambers under C and N starvation conditions due to growth on nonselective residual assimilable organic carbon. Similar observations were made in experiments with a pilot sand filter reactor bioaugmented with MSH1. BAM conversion to 2,6-DCBA was not affected by loss of the DCBA-catabolic genes. Our results show that MSH1 is prone to BAM-catabolic instability under the conditions occurring in a DWTP. While conversion of BAM to 2,6-DCBA remains unaffected, BAM mineralization activity is at risk, and monitoring of metabolites is warranted.IMPORTANCE Bioaugmentation of dedicated biofiltration units with bacterial strains that grow on and mineralize micropollutants was suggested as an alternative for treating micropollutant-contaminated water in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). Organic-pollutant-catabolic genes in bacteria are often easily lost, especially under nonselective conditions, which affects the bioaugmentation success. In this study, we provide evidence that Aminobacter sp. strain MSH1, which uses the common groundwater micropollutant 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) as a C source, shows a high frequency of loss of its BAM-mineralizing phenotype due to the loss of genes that convert 2,6-DCBA to Krebs cycle intermediates when nonselective conditions occur. Moreover, we show that catabolic-gene loss also occurs in the oligotrophic environment of DWTPs, where growth of MSH1 depends mainly on the high fluxes of low concentrations of assimilable organic carbon, and hence show the ecological relevance of catabolic instability for using strain MSH1 for BAM removal in DWTPs.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

When intact cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 carrying DNA fragments encoding the first three enzymes of the pathway were incubated with naphthalene, they formed products of the dioxygenase-catalyzed ring cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene. These products were separated by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 and were identified by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate (HCCA) and trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate (tHBPA). HCCA was detected as the first reaction product in these incubation mixtures by its characteristic UV spectrum, which slowly changed to a spectrum indicative of an equilibrium mixture of HCCA and tHBPA. Isomerization of either purified product occurred slowly and spontaneously to give an equilibrium mixture of essentially the same composition. tHBPA is also formed from HCCA by the action of an isomerase enzyme encoded by plasmid \\tO\\nNAH7\\tgene\\n. The gene encoding this enzyme, \\tO\\nnahD\\tgene\\n, was cloned on a 1.95-kb KpnI-BglII fragment. Extracts of Escherichia coli JM109 carrying this fragment catalyzed the rapid equilibration of HCCA and tHBPA.

However, little is known about the key players involved in the process. Methanogenic hexadecane-degrading consortia were enriched from an oilfield (Shengli, China). The microbial dynamics during the transfer incubations were monitored using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting of 16S rRNA genes in combination with cloning and sequencing. The archaeal community shifted from a predominance of aceticlastic Methanosaeta during early cultivation to a substantial increase in hydrogenotrophic Methanoculleus in the highly enriched culture. Bacterial T-RFs 161 and 164 bp were consistently detected during the incubation and became dominant in the highly enriched culture. T-RF 161 bp primarily represented uncultured Waste Water of Evry 1 bacterium, which was possibly associated with Candidatus Cloacamonas acidaminovorans (99.7% sequence similarity).

The purified enzyme was homogeneous in disc electrophoresis, and the molecular weight was found to be approximately 80,000 by gel filtration. The enzyme catalyzed the following reaction: cyclohexylamine+O2+H2O leads to cyclohexanone+NH3+H2O2. The enzyme thus can be classified as an amine oxidase; it utilized oxygen as the ultimate electron acceptor. The pH optimum of the reaction was 6.8 and the apparent Km value for cyclohexylamine was 2.5 X 10(-4) M. The enzyme was highly specific for the deamination of alicyclic primary amines such as cyclohexylamine, but was found to be inactive toward ordinary amines used as substrates for amine oxidases. The enzyme solution was yellow in color and showed a typical flavoprotein spectrum; the addition of cyclohexylamine under anaerobic conditions caused reduction of the flavin in the native enzyme. The flavin of the prosthetic group was identified as FAD by thin layer chromatography. The participation of sulfhydryl groups in the enzymic action was also suggested by the observation that the enzyme activity was inhibited in the presence of PCMB and could be recovered by the addition of glutathione.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

The characterization of the site through 10 monitoring wells evidenced that leaked PCE was transformed to TCE and cis-DCE via hydrogenolysis. Carbon isotopic mass balance of chlorinated ethenes pointed to two distinct sources of contamination and discarded relevant alternate degradation pathways in the aquifer. Application of specific-genus primers targeting Dehalococcoides mccartyi species and the \\tO\\nvinyl chloride-to-ethene reductive dehalogenase\\tenzyme\\n \\tO\\nvcrA\\tgene\\n indicated the presence of autochthonous bacteria capable of the complete dechlorination of PCE. The observed cis-DCE stall was consistent with the aquifer geochemistry (positive redox potentials; presence of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and sulphate; absence of ferrous iron), which was thermodynamically favourable to dechlorinate highly chlorinated ethenes but required lower redox potentials to evolve beyond cis-DCE to the innocuous end product ethene. Accordingly, the addition of lactate or a mixture of ethanol plus methanol as electron donor sources in parallel field-derived anoxic microcosms accelerated dechlorination of PCE and passed cis-DCE up to ethene, unlike the controls (without amendments, representative of field natural attenuation). Lactate fermentation produced acetate at near-stoichiometric amounts. The array of techniques used in this study provided complementary lines of evidence to suggest that enhanced anaerobic bioremediation using lactate as electron donor source is a feasible strategy to successfully decontaminate this site.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

When the soil was amended with nutrients, plasmid transfer and enhanced degradation of 2,4-D were observed. These findings were most striking in the B horizon, where the indigenous bacteria were unable to degrade any of the 2,4-D (100 mg/kg of soil) during at least 22 days but where inoculation with either of the two plasmid donors resulted in complete 2,4-D degradation within 14 days. In contrast, in soils not amended with nutrients, inoculation of donors in the A horizon and subsequent formation of transconjugants (10(5) CFU/g of soil) could not increase the 2,4-D degradation rate compared to that of the noninoculated soil. However, donor inoculation in the nonamended B-horizon soil resulted in complete degradation of 2,4-D within 19 days, while no degradation at all was observed in noninoculated soil during 89 days. With plasmid \\tO\\npEMT1\\tgene\\n, this enhanced degradation seemed to be due only to transconjugants (10(5) CFU/g of soil), since the donor was already undetectable when degradation started. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes showed that inoculation of the donors was followed by a shift in the microbial community structure of the nonamended B-horizon soils. The new 16S rRNA gene fragments in the DGGE profile corresponded with the 16S rRNA genes of 2,4-D-degrading transconjugant colonies isolated on agar plates. This result indicates that the observed change in the community was due to proliferation of transconjugants formed in soil. Overall, this work clearly demonstrates that bioaugmentation can constitute an effective strategy for cleanup of soils which are poor in nutrients and microbial activity, such as those of the B horizon.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

Tests for utilization of acyclic isoprenols such as citronellol and geraniol were complicated by toxic effects of these alcohols, and most species tested were killed by exposure to citronellol or geraniol (0.1%, vol/vol) in liquid culture. In the case of Pseudomonas citronellolis, sensitivity to isoprenols is reduced by prior induction of the isoprenoid degradative pathway via either growth on succinate in the presence of citronellol or growth on citronellic acid. For this species, citronellic acid proved to be the best isoprenoid growth substrate tested. Geraniol utilization as a taxonomic indicator for different subgroups of pseudomonads is discussed. Only a few of the species tested were able to utilize acyclic isoprenoids. Two species which utilize C10 acyclic isoprenoids, P. aeruginosa and P. mendocina, were shown to contain the inducible enzyme \\tO\\ngeranyl-coenzyme A carboxylase\\tenzyme\\n, one of the unique enzymes in the isoprenol degradative pathway known to occur in P. citronellolis.

In topsoil samples, (14)C-atrazine mineralization lag times decreased after atrazine application and increased with increasing time after atrazine application, suggesting that atrazine application resulted into the proliferation of atrazine mineralizing microbial populations which decayed when atrazine application stopped. Decay rates appeared however much slower than growth rates. Atrazine application also resulted into the increase of the atrazine mineralization potential in deeper layers which was explained by the growth on leached atrazine as measured in soil leachates recovered from that depth. However, no decay was observed during intermittent periods without atrazine application in the deeper soil layer. \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n and \\tO\\ntrzN\\tgene\\n gene quantification confirmed partly the growth and decay of the atrazine degrading populations in the soil and suggested that especially \\tO\\ntrzN\\tgene\\n bearing populations are the dominant atrazine degrading populations in both topsoil and deeper soil.

Here, the complete genome sequence of strain P73(T) is presented and analyzed. Besides a 4.5-Mb circular chromosome, strain P73(T) carries five plasmids, and encodes 4827 predicted protein-coding sequences. One hundred and thirty-eight genes, including 14 dioxygenase genes, were predicted to be involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds, and most of these genes are clustered in four regions. P73_0346 is the first \\tO\\nfluoranthene 7,8-dioxygenase\\tenzyme\\n to be discovered and the first \\tO\\nfluoranthene dioxygenase\\tenzyme\\n within the toluene/biphenyl family.

Malathion was used as a sole source of carbon (50 mg/l) to enumerate malathion degraders, which were designated as IS1, IS2, IS3, IS4, and IS5. They were identified, based on their morphological and biochemical characteristics, as Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Micrococcus lylae, Pseudomonas aureofaciens, and Acetobacter liquefaciens, respectively.

The 16S rRNA gene of IS1 shared 99% similarity with that of Alphaprotoebacterium BAL284, while IS2 scored 100% similarity with that of Pseudomonas putida 32zhy. Malathion residues almost completely disappeared within 6 days of incubation in IS2 liquid cultures.

            "{18558420: 'The distribution of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn between a contaminated soil and the tree species Paulownia tomentosa was investigated in a pilot-scale assisted phytoremediation study. The influence of the addition of EDTA, tartrate and glutamate at 1, 5 and 10mM concentrations on metal accumulation by the plant and on metal mobilization in soil was evaluated. Root/shoot metal concentration ratios were in the range of 3-5 for Zn, 7-17 for Cu, 9-18 for Cd and 11-39 for Pb, depending on the type and concentration of complexing agent. A significant enhancement of metal uptake in response to complexing agent application was mainly obtained in roots for Pb (i.e. 359 mg kg(-1) for EDTA 10mM and 128 mg kg(-1) for the control), Cu (i.e. 594 mg kg(-1) for glutamate 10mM and 146 mg kg(-1) for the control) and, with the exception of glutamate, also for Zn (i.e. 670 mg kg(-1) for tartrate 10mM and 237 mg kg(-1) for the control). Despite its higher metal mobilization capacity, EDTA produced a metal accumulation in plants quite similar to those obtained with tartrate and glutamate. Consequently the concentration gradient between soil pore water and plant tissues does not seem to be the predominant mechanism for metal accumulation in Paulownia tomentosa and a role of the plant should be invoked in the selection of the chemical species taken up. Metal bioavailability in soil at the end of the experiment was higher in the trials treated with EDTA than in those treated with tartrate and glutamate, the latter not being significantly different from the control. These findings indicated the persistence of a leaching risk associated to the use of this chelator, while an increase of the environmental impact is not expected when glutamate and tartrate are applied.', 18572528: 'The extracellular enzyme secretion and biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were studied in agitated and shallow stationary liquid cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Veratryl alcohol and Tween80 were added to cultures as lignin peroxidase (LiP) and manganese peroxidase (MnP) inducer, respectively. Shallow stationary cultures were suitable for the production of enzyme, whereas agitated cultures enhanced overall biodegradation by facilitating interphase mass transfer of PAHs into aqueous phases. The use of a LiP stimulator, veratryl alcohol, did not increase PAH degradation but significantly enhanced LiP activity. In contrast, Tween80 increased both MnP secretion and PAH degradation in shallow stationary cultures. On the other hand, high PAH degradation was observed in agitated cultures in the absence of detectable LiP and MnP activities. The results suggested that extracellular peroxidase activities are not directly related to the PAH degradation, and the increased solubility rather than enzyme activity may be more important in the promotion of PAH degradation.', 18575116: 'Rhodococcus erythropolis USTB-03 is a promising bacterial strain for the biodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT) via a sulfur-specific pathway in which DBT is converted to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2HBP) as an end product. The effects of nicotinamide and riboflavin on the sulfur specific activity (SA) of DBT biodesulfurization by R. erythropolis USTB-03 were investigated. Both nicotinamide and riboflavin were found to enhance the expression of SA, which was not previously reported. When R. erythropolis USTB-03 was grown on a medium containing nicotinamide of 10.0 mmol or riboflavin of 50.0 micromol, SA was raised from 68.0 or so to more than 130 mmol 2HBP/(kg dry cells. x ). When R. erythropolis USTB-03 was grown in the presence of both nicotinamide of 5.0 mmol and riboflavin of 25.0 Cmicrool, SA was further increased to 159.0 mmol 2HBP/(kg dry cells. x ). It is suggested that the biological synthesis of reduced form of flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2), an essential coenzyme for the activities of biodesulfurization enzyme Dsz C and A, might be enhanced by nicotinamide and riboflavin, which was responsible for the increased SA of R. erythropolis USTB-03.', 18581266: 'The bacterial leaching of zinc and iron from solid wastes at the Isdemir iron and steel plant has been investigated using Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans as the bacterial agent. The effects of a range of operational parameters, including particle size, solids concentration and pH, on the efficiency of the bioleaching process were investigated. In each test, several variables were determined to assess the efficiency of leaching, including slurry pH and redox potential, temperature, bacteria population and concentrations of zinc and iron in solution. Experimental results demonstrated that pulp solids concentration, slurry pH and solids particle size were all important parameters in the bacterial leaching process. Maximum extraction was achieved at pH values around 1.3 and a solids concentration of 1% w/v, with 35% of the Zn content and 37% of the Fe being dissolved.', 18585754: 'A photocatalytic process based on immobilized titanium dioxide was used to treat crude solutions of azo, anthraquinone and phthalocyanine textile dyes. In addition, the process was applied to the treat autoxidized chemically reduced azo dyes, i.e. representatives of recalcitrant dye residues after biological sequential anaerobic-aerobic treatment. Photocatalysis was able to remove more than 90% color from crude as well as autoxidized chemically reduced dye solutions. UV-absorbance and COD were also removed but to a lower extent (50% in average). The end products of photocatalytic treatment were not toxic toward methanogenic bacteria. The results demonstrate that photocatalysis can be used as a pre- or post-treatment method to biological anaerobic treatment of dye-containing textile wastewater.', 18589972: 'We investigated enrichment with salicylate as a method to stimulate the degradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by a microbial communityfrom a bioreactortreating PAH-contaminated soil. DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) was used to compare the effect of alternate methods of salicylate addition (spike vs slow, continuous addition) on the diversity of the enriched microbial community. After identification of salicylate degraders by SIP, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) primers were developed to quantify the abundances of three groups containing salicylate-utilizing organisms in the bioreactor community before and after enrichment. The different methods of salicylate addition were found to select for different microbial communities. Two groups containing salicylate-degrading bacteria increased in abundance substantially after enrichment by continuous addition of salicylate but did not increase in abundance in response to the spike addition, whereas a third group increased in abundance in response to both methods of salicylate addition. The initial rate of naphthalene mineralization increased significantly after enrichment by spike addition of salicylate, but neither phenanthrene nor benzo[a] pyrene mineralization rates were enhanced. Continuous addition of salicylate did not enhance the mineralization rate for any of the PAHs. These results suggest that enrichment with salicylate can select for naphthalene-degrading bacteria, but does not select for organisms responsible for degrading PAHs of higher molecular weight. Differences in microbial selection observed in this study that resulted from different rates of carbon source addition also have implications for the design of SIP experiments with water-soluble carbon sources.', 18597879: 'The type and the position of the substituent in the phenolic ring, the bond dissociation energy and the exogenously supplied carbon source as well as the inductive and resonance effect phenomena of the substituents adjust the biodegradability of the phenolic compounds. The comparative biodegradation study of mono-nitrophenols (electron acceptors) and mono-methylphenols (electron donors) revealed that it is a completely photoregulated process. The closer the donor group (OH(-)) of the phenolic ring is to the acceptor group (NO(2)(-)), the higher the biodegradation values are (2-nitrophenol>3-nitrophenol>4-nitrophenol); the further the donor group (OH(-)) of the phenolic compound is from the second donor group (CH(3)(+)), the higher the biodegradation values are (2-methylphenol<3-methylphenol<4-methylphenol). However, there are compounds without a specific role of acceptor or donor such as mono-iodophenols, where a type of counteraction between the inductive and resonance effect determines the behavior of the substituent. This fact combined with the presence of the hydroxyl group in the phenolic ring gave the observed stabilization in the biodegradation results of mono-iodophenols (2-iodophenol approximately 3-iodophenol approximately 4-iodophenol).', 18599290: 'Activated carbon was prepared from an inexpensive and renewable carbon source, Typha orientalis, by H(3)PO(4) activation and then impregnated with different Mn salts and tested for its Neutral Red (NR) adsorption capacities. The amount of Mn impregnated in the activated carbon was influenced by the anion species. Impregnation with Mn decreased the surface area, changed the pore size and crystal structure, and introduced more acidic functional groups such as carboxyl, lactone and phenol groups. The optimum adsorption performance for all the activated carbons was obtained at pH 3.7, Mn-Carbon dose of 0.100g/100ml solution and contact time 4.5h. The adsorption isotherms fit the Langmuir isotherm equation. The kinetic data followed the pseudo-second-order model. The thermodynamic parameters indicated that the processes were spontaneous and endothermic. According to these results, the prepared Mn modified activated carbons are promising adsorbents for the removal of Neutral Red from wastewater.', 18663415: 'The present work is intended to investigate biodegradation of formaldehyde by the marine microalga Nannochloropsis oculata ST-3 strain. Formaldehyde concentration in the medium decreased with the growth of the ST-3 strain. It is observed that the degradation of formaldehyde concentration depends on the increased cell number of the ST-3 strain. The ST-3 strain which was adapted to formaldehyde stepwise was able to tolerate to 19.9 ppm formaldehyde and degrade 99.3% of it in the medium for 22 days. Tolerance and degradation ability of formaldehyde by the ST-3 strain was improved by stepwise increasing of the formaldehyde concentration. Transformation of [13C]formaldehyde in the medium with the passage of incubation was monitored by using a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. Formaldehyde was transformed into formate, and these two substances degraded in the medium with the passage of incubation as clearly shown by the NMR spectrum.', 18682902: 'Inhibition and restoration of different concentrations of phenol on the bioactivity of anaerobic granular sludge were investigated with laboratory-scale equipment. It indicated that phenol concentration lower than 50 mg/l show no inhibitory effect on bioactivities of granular sludge. However, methane productivity, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) content, and coenzyme F(420) activity were decreased by varying degrees when phenol concentration adopted for inhibition ranged between 50 and 400 mg/l. Noticeably, methane productivity could be fully or partly restored in case the phenol was removed after 24 h of phenol inhibition.', 18722001: 'Biodegradation is one of the primary mechanisms for elimination of petroleum and other hydrocarbon pollutants from the environment. It is considered an environmentally acceptable way of eliminating oils and fuel because the majority of hydrocarbons in crude oils and refined products are biodegradable. Petroleum hydrocarbon compounds bind to soil components and are difficult to remove and degrade. Bioemulsifiers can emulsify hydrocarbons enhancing their water solubility and increasing the displacement of oily substances from soil particles. For these reasons, inclusion of bioemulsifiers in a bioremediation treatment of a hydrocarbon polluted environment could be really advantageous. There is a useful diversity of bioemulsifiers due to the wide variety of producer microorganisms. Also their chemical compositions and functional properties can be strongly influenced by environmental conditions. The effectiveness of the bioemulsifiers as biostimulating agent in oil bioremediation processes has been demonstrated by several authors in different experimental assays. For example, they have shown to be really efficient in combination with other products frequently used in oil bioremediation such as they are inorganic fertilizer (NPK) and oleophilic fertilizer (i.e. S200C). On the other hand, the bioemulsifiers have shown to be more efficient in the treatment of soil with high percentage of clay. Finally, it has been proved their efficacy in other biotechnological processes such as in situ treatment and biopiles. This paper reviews literature concerning the application of bioemulsifiers in the bioremediation of soil polluted with hydrocarbons, and summarizes aspects of the current knowledge about their industrial application in bioremediation processes.', 18723282: 'In this article, the inhibitory impact of metals on substrate utilization and microbial carbonate precipitation (MCP) by ureolytic mixed cultures (UMC) was investigated with glucose and mineral medium under batch conditions. The IC(50) (toxicant concentration eliciting 50% inhibitory effect) values were determined from the BOD values of samples. Inhibition, expressed as the value of 50% inhibitory effect (IC(50)), was evaluated by the decrease in substrate removal using BOD tests. The effect of toxicity of metals on substrate degradation, IC(50) values, was found to increase in the following order: Cd(II)>Cu(II)>Pb(II)>Cr(VI)>Ni(II)>Zn(II). Nitrification a possible phenomenon in the biocatalytic process was observed in several samples and this inhibited the precipitation of soluble calcium. During the removal of calcium from industrial calcium-rich wastewater, toxicity of metal at higher metal concentrations and possibility of nitrification at higher sludge ages should be considered.', 18763510: 'This paper focus on changes of high solid content sludge (7%, 9% and 13%) hydrolysis with microwave irradiation also anaerobic biodegradation of treated sludge was tested by biochemical methane potential (BMP) procedure. Results showed that microwave irradiation provided a rapid temperature increasing. Hydrolysis accelerated the solubilization of volatile suspended solid (VSS) and suspended solid (SS). COD, TOC, NH4+-N, TN, and TP concentration of liquor sludge increased, while pH decreased. Sludge solid content was found to be the most influential parameter. VSS and SS dissolving ratio of sludge with 13% solid content were lower than sludge with 7% and 9% solid content. 23% of VSS and 18% of SS dissolved for 9% sludge at 170 degrees C with 5 min, SCOD of liquor was 41 g/L, and concentration of TOC and NH4+-N were 30 g/L and 1 g/L respectively. Biodegradation of treated sludge improved. Methane production of 9% sludge at 170 degrees C with 5 min and 10 min were 27% and 30.8% higher than that of untreated sludge. Hydrolysis time increasing from 5 min to 10 min brought an improvement of 4%, 3.6% and 5.7% methane production at 120 degrees C, 150 degrees C and 170 degrees C.', 18763513: 'Solution culture experiment was carried out to investigate the effects on the removal efficiencies of N and P by perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) under the Cu stress and the ecological response of ryegrass to various dosages of Cu2+. The results indicated that the removal efficiencies of N and P decreased under all the intimidating conditions compared with the control tanks, which followed the second-rate equation. The removal efficiencies of N and P and the plant growth at low Cu2+ concentrations (< or = 0.2 mg/L) were higher than those at high Cu2+ concentration (> or = 0.5 mg/L), and the biomass (dry weight) was increased at low Cu2+ concentrations (< or = 0.2 mg/L) relative to control solution. In addition, the plant was able to remove Cu2+ in the eutrophic water simultaneously, and the removal efficiencies under the high Cu2+ concentrations were higher than those under low Cu2+ concentrations. Results show that the root was the main section for accumulating Cu2+ and the data of Cu2+ uptake by perennial ryegrass fitted Michaelis-Menten kinetics equation. Perennial ryegrass were sensitive to Cu2+ treatment. Root elongation was reduced in Cu2+ treatment solutions, but the numbers of new-growth roots increased compared with those cultivated in control solution.', 18803113: 'A bacterium (Paracoccus sp. YM3) capable of degrading carbofuran was isolated from carbofuran-contaminated sludge. The strain was shown to metabolize carbofuran (50 mg L(-1)) to carbofuran-7-phenol in minimal salt medium within 6 days in which the pesticide was the only source of carbon. Carbofuran and its main metabolite were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The addition of an other carbon source led to accelerated biodegradation. The relevant degrading-enzyme was intracellular and inducible. A tobacco hypersensitivity experiment showed that YM3 could eliminate carbofuran in soils effectively and safely. This is the first report of a Paracoccus sp. that could degrade carbofuran. The present study may provide a basis for biotreatment of wastewaters and bioremediation of carbofuran-contaminated soils.', 18822774: 'Sequential photo- and biodegradation of p-cresol was studied using a mercury lamp, as well as KrCl and XeCl excilamps. Preirradiation of p-cresol at a concentration of 10(-4) M did not affect the rate of its subsequent biodegradation. An increase in the concentration of p-cresol to 10(-3) M and in the duration preliminary UV irradiation inhibited subsequent biodegradation. Biodegradation of p-cresol was accompanied by the formation of a product with a fluorescence maximum at 365 nm (lambdaex 280 nm), and photodegradation yielded a compound fluorescing at 400 nm (lambdaex 330 nm). Sequential UV and biodegradation led to the appearance of bands in the fluorescence spectra that were ascribed to p-cresol and its photolysis products. It was shown that sequential use of biological and photochemical degradation results in degradation of not only the initial toxicant but also the metabolites formed during its biodegradation.', 18828388: 'Mn2+ concentration affecting polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pyrene degradation by the Flavobacterium sp. FCN2 was investigated by adding Mn2+ during several periods, which including bacteria cultivation period, bacteria degrading pyrene and enzymatic degradation period. Results show the concentration of Mn2+ was beneficial for pyrene degradation, and Mn2+ was no influential to bacteria growth and magnitude. When Mn2+ was added during culturing strain FCN2 period, bacteria FCN2 can enrich Mn2+, and pyrene removal efficiency by Mn2+ enrichment bacteria is 1.26 times more than that of without Mn2+ enrichment bacteria. As well as the situation that adding Mn2+ during FCN2 degrading pyrene period that pyrene removal efficiency is 1.67 times more than that of without Mn2+. And when adding Mn2+ during enzymatic degradation periods, the elimination efficiency of pyrene was 1.30 times more than that of without Mn2+.', 18848715: 'Seedlings of Helianthus annuus L. (HA) and Brassica juncea (BJ) were used to test the effect of the pH, the presence of phosphates, and the addition of ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) or citrate on the uptake and the translocation of uranium isotopes ((238)U, (235)U, and (234)U) and (226)Ra. The results indicated that the presence of phosphates generally reduces the uptake and transfer of uranium from the roots to the shoots of HA. In the case of BJ, while phosphate enhanced the retention of uranium by roots, the translocation was poorer. Likewise, for (226)Ra, the best translocation was in the absence of phosphates for both species. The addition of citrate increased the translocation of uranium for both species, but had no clear effect on the transfer of (226)Ra. The effect of EDTA was much more moderate both for uranium and for (226)Ra, and for both plant species. Only noticeable was a slightly better uptake of (226)Ra by BJ at neutral pH, although the translocation was lower.', 18848724: 'A series of amphiphilic tri-block copolymers based on poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGE) with various segment ratios of PEO/PLGA and segment lengths of PEO were synthesized. Multi-morphological biodegradable nanoparticles - PLGE-NPs were fabricated by an improved emulsion/solvent evaporation technique in the absence of surfactant. By adjusting segment ratio of PLGA/PEO (w/w) and molecular weight of PEO, various morphological and nanoscale sized spheres, elliptic spheres, short rods and threads could be formed. The auto-assembling mechanism of the PLGE-NPs and influencing effectors of composition of the PLGE on morphology of the PLGE-NPs were discussed. The PLGE-NPs were biodegradable, and the factors that affected the degradation rate of the PLGE-NPs were also discussed. By using the amphiphilic PLGE polymer, the biodegradable nanoscale immunosuppressive agent - multi-morphological Cyclosporine (CsA)-loaded PLGE-NPs was fabricated. CsA release behavior of the CsA-loaded PLGE-NPs in vitro was determined, and the effect factors on CsA release behavior of the CsA-loaded PLGE-NPs were discussed.', 18853803: 'Electron transfer mediators (ETMs) such as low-molecular-mass quinones (e.g., juglone and lawsone) and humic substances are believed to play a role in many redox reactions involved in contaminant transformations and the biogeochemical cycling of many redox-active elements (e.g., Fe and Mn) in aquatic and terrestrial environments. This study examines the effects of a series of compounds representing major classes of natural and synthetic organic ETMs, including low-molecular-mass quinones, humic substances, phenazines, phenoxazines, phenothiazines, and indigo derivatives, on the bioreduction of lepidocrocite (gamma-FeOOH) by the dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing bacterium Shewanella putrefaciens CN32. Although S. putrefaciens CN32 was able to reduce lepidocrocite in the absence of exogenous ETMs, the addition of exogenous ETMs enhanced the bioreduction of lepidocrocite. In general, the rate of Fe(II) production correlated well with the reduction potentials of the ETMs. The addition of humic acids or unfractionated natural organic matter at concentrations of 10 mg organic CL(-1) resulted in, at best, a minimal enhancement of lepidocrocite bioreduction. This observation suggests that electron shuttling by humic substances is not likely to play a major role in Fe(lll) bioreduction in oligotrophic environments such as subsurface sediments with low organic C contents.', 18956741: 'Changes in the rates of microbiological degradation of kerosene, diesel fuel, and fuel oil under the effect of UV irradiation were estimated by testing the respiratory activity of microbial communities. The strongest inhibitory effect was observed upon simultaneous UV irradiation of both natural water and petroleum products. Concentrations of CO2 in the microbial communities (microcosms) decreased from 6.7 to 3.6 vol. % upon oxidation of kerosene, from 5.9 to 0.8 vol. % upon oxidation of diesel fuel, and from 5.7 to 0.05 vol. % upon oxidation of fuel oil.', 18957759: 'Anaerobic digestion is a technology which is used to produce methane from organic solids and energy crops. Especially in recent years, the fermentation of energy crops has become more and more important because of increasing costs for energy and special benefits for renewable energy sources in Germany. Anaerobic bacteria require macro and micro nutrients to grow. Absence of these elements can inhibit the anaerobic process significantly. In particular mono-substrates like maize or certain industrial wastewater often cannot provide all required nutrients. For this reason this research investigates the influence of substrate and trace elements on anaerobic digestion in detail. Different agricultural anaerobic biomasses are analysed with special regard to their trace element content. Based on these results, the influence of three trace elements (iron, cobalt, and nickel) on anaerobic digestion was studied in anaerobic batch tests at different sludge loading rates and for different substrates (maize and acetate). Biogas production was found to be 35% for maize silage and up to 70% higher for acetate with trace element dosage than in the reference reactor.', 18990419: 'Flow-through reactors with manganese oxides were examined for their capacity to remove 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) at microg L(-1) and ng L(-1) range from synthetic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. The mineral MnO(2) reactors removed 93% at a volumetric loading rate (B(V)) of 5 microg EE2 L(-1) d(-1) and from a B(V) of 40 microg EE2 L(-1) d(-1) on, these reactors showed 75% EE2 removal. With the biologically produced manganese oxides, only 57% EE2 was removed at 40 microg EE2 L(-1) d(-1). EE2 removal in the ng L(-1) range was 84%. The ammonium present in the influent (10 mg N L(-1)) was nitrified and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were found to be of prime importance for the degradation of EE2. Remarkably, EE2 removal by AOB continued for a period of 4 months after depleting NH(4)(+) in the influent. EE2 removal by manganese-oxidizing bacteria was inhibited by NH(4)(+). These results indicate that the metabolic properties of nitrifiers can be employed to polish water containing EE2 based estrogenic activity.', 19017114: 'Environmental pollution is one of the major problems for human health. Toxic heavy metals are normally present as soil constituents or can also be spread out in the environment by human activity and agricultural techniques. Soil contamination by heavy metals as cadmium, highlights two main aspects: on one side they interfere with the life cycle of plants and therefore reduce crop yields, and on the other hand, once adsorbed and accumulated into the plant tissues, they enter the food chain poisoning animals and humans. Considering this point of view, understanding the mechanism by which plants handle heavy metal exposure, in particular cadmium stress, is a primary goal of plant-biotechnology research or plant breeders whose aim is to create plants that are able to recover high amounts of heavy metals, which can be used for phytoremediation, or identify crop varieties that do not accumulate toxic metal in grains or fruits. In this review we focus on the main symptoms of cadmium toxicity both on root apparatus and shoots. We elucidate the mechanisms that plants activate to prevent absorption or to detoxify toxic metal ions, such as synthesis of phytochelatins, metallothioneins and enzymes involved in stress response. Finally we consider new plant-biotechnology applications that can be applied for phytoremediation.', 19046757: 'Characterization and treatment of a real pharmaceutical wastewater containing 775 mg dissolved organic carbon per liter by a solar photo-Fenton/biotreatment were studied. There were also many inorganic compounds present in the matrix. The most important chemical in this wastewater was nalidixic acid (45 mg/L), an antibiotic pertaining to the quinolone group. A Zahn-Wellens test demonstrated that the real bulk organic content of the wastewater was biodegradable, but only after long biomass adaptation; however, the nalidixic acid concentration remained constant, showing that it cannot be biodegraded. An alternative is chemical oxidation (photo-Fenton process) first to enhance biodegradability, followed by a biological treatment (Immobilized Biomass Reactor--IBR). In this case, two studies of photo-Fenton treatment of the real wastewater were performed, one with an excess of H2O2 (kinetic study) and another with controlled H2O2 dosing (biodegradability and toxicity studies). In the kinetic study, nalidixic acid completely disappeared after 190 min. In the other experiment with controlled H2O2, nalidixic acid degradation was complete at 66 mM of H2O2 consumed. Biodegradability and toxicity bioassays showed that photo-Fenton should be performed until total degradation of nalidixic acid before coupling a biological treatment. Analysis of the average oxidation state (AOS) demonstrated the formation of more oxidized intermediates. With this information, the photo-Fenton treatment time (190 min) and H2O2 dose (66 mM) necessary for adequate biodegradability of the wastewater could be determined. An IBR operated in batch mode was able to reduce the remaining DOC to less than 35 mg/L. Ammonium consumption and NO3- generation demonstrated that nitrification was also attained in the IBR. Overall DOC degradation efficiency of the combined photo-Fenton and biological treatment was over 95%, of which 33% correspond to the solar photochemical process and 62% to the biological treatment.', 19059774: 'The effects of increasing nitrobenzene (NB) concentrations and hydraulic retention times (HRT) on the treatment of NB were investigated in a sequential anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR)/aerobic completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system. In the first step of the study, the maximum COD removal efficiencies were found as 88% and 92% at NB concentrations varying between 30 mg L(-1) and 210 mg L(-1) in ABR. The minimum COD removal efficiency was 79% at a NB concentration of 700 mg L(-1). The removal efficiency of NB was nearly 100% for all NB concentrations in the ABR reactor. The methane gas production and the methane gas percentage remained stable (1500 mL day(-1) and 48-50%, respectively) as the NB concentration was increased from 30 to 210 mg L(-1). In the second step of the study it was found that as the HRT decreased from 10.38 days to 2.5 days the COD removal efficiencies decreased slightly from 94% to 92% in the ABR. For maximum COD and NB removal efficiencies the optimum HRT was found as 2.5 days in the ABR. The total COD removal efficiency was 95% in sequential anaerobic (ABR)/aerobic (CSTR) reactor system at a minimum HRT of 1 day. When the HRT was decreased from 10.38 days to 1 day, the methane percentage decreased from 42% to 29% in an ABR reactor treating 100 mg L(-1) NB. Nitrobenzene was reduced to aniline under anaerobic conditions while aniline was mineralized to catechol with meta cleavage under aerobic conditions.', 19070346: \"A new approach to assess biocompatibility of an effluent, based on combination of different bioassays and chemical analyses, has been tested using a mixture of four commercial pesticides treated by a solar photo-Fenton as target effluent. A very fast elimination of the pesticides occurred (all of them were below detection limit at t30W=36 min), but mineralisation was a more time-consuming process, due to the formation of organic intermediates and to the presence of solvents, as shown by GC-MS analysis. Measurements based on activated sludge indicated that detoxification was coincident with the removal of the active ingredients, while more sensitive Vibrio fischeri bacterium showed significant toxicity until the end of the experiment, although the effluent might be compatible with biological processes. Biodegradability of the solutions was enhanced by the photochemical process, to reach BOD5/COD ratios above 0.8. Longer time bioassays, such as the Zahn-Wellens' test, support the applicability of coupling photochemical with activated sludge-based biological processes to deal with these effluents.\", 19070485: 'A marine, unicellular cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus strain BDU/75042 was found to sequester uranium from aqueous systems at pH 7.8. The organism could remove 72% (53.5 mg U g(-1) dry weight) of uranium from test solutions containing 100 microM uranyl carbonate within 1h. The equilibrium data fitted well in the Langmuir isotherm thus suggesting a monolayer adsorption of uranium on the cyanobacterial biomass and predicted the maximum adsorption capacity of 124 mg U g(-1) dry weight. Light and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF) spectroscopy confirmed the uranyl adsorption by this organism. Most of the bound uranium was found to be associated with the extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) suggesting its interaction with the surface active ligands. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy suggested the amide groups and the deprotonated carboxyl groups on the cyanobacterial cell surface were likely to be involved in uranyl adsorption. The cell bound uranium could be released by washing with ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) or 0.1N HCl. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses revealed the identity of uranium deposits associated with the cell biomass as uranyl carbonate hydrate. The study revealed the potential of this cyanobacterium for harvesting uranium from natural aquatic environments.', 19091385: 'Upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) bioreactors are commonly used for anaerobic wastewater treatment. Trace metals need to be dosed to these bioreactors to maintain microbial metabolism and growth. The dosing needs to balance the supply of a minimum amount of micronutrients to support a desired microbial activity or growth rate with a maximum level of micronutrient supply above which the trace metals become inhibitory or toxic. In studies on granular sludge reactors, the required micronutrients are undefined and different metal formulations with differences in composition, concentration and species are used. Moreover, an appropriate quantification of the required nutrient dosing and suitable ranges during the entire operational period has been given little attention. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art knowledge of the interactions between trace metals and cells growing in anaerobic granules, which is the main type of biomass retention in anaerobic wastewater treatment reactors. The impact of trace metal limitation as well as overdosing (toxicity) on the biomass is overviewed and the consequences for reactor performance are detailed. Special attention is given to the influence of metal speciation in the liquid and solid phase on bioavailability. The currently used methods for trace metal dosing into wastewater treatment reactors are overviewed and ways of optimization are suggested.', 19091530: 'The sorption efficiency of chickpea husk of black gram variety (BGH), for the removal of organophosphorous pesticides (OPPs), i.e. triazophos (TAP) and methyl parathion (MP) from aqueous media has been investigated. Optimization of operating sorption parameters, i.e. particle size, sorbent dose, agitation time, pH, initial concentration of sorbates, and temperature has been studied. The sorption data fitted well to Freundlich, Langmuir and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) sorption isotherms. The maximum sorption capacities of BGH for TAP and MP were calculated to be 3.5+/-0.45 and 10.6+/-0.83 mmol g(-1) by Freundlich, 0.0077+/-0.021 and 0.025+/-0.0094 mmol g(-1) by Langmuir and 0.48+/-0.037 and 0.15+/-0.077 mmol g(-1) by D-R isotherms respectively, employing 0.2g of sorbent, at pH 6, 90 min agitation time and at 303 K. Application of first order Lagergren and Morris-Weber equations to the kinetic data yielded correlation coefficients, close to unity and showed partial intra-particle diffusion. The negative values of thermodynamic parameters, i.e. DeltaH (kJ mol(-1)), DeltaS (J mol(-1) K(-1)) and DeltaG (kJ mol(-1)) indicate the exothermic and spontaneous nature of the sorption process. The sorbed pesticides were recovered by sonication with methanol, making the regeneration and reutilization of the sorbents promising. The investigated sorbent exhibited potential applications in water decontamination, treatments of industrial and agricultural waste waters and thus productively demonstrated viable use of agricultural waste material.', 19091554: 'In the present study, the level of thiols and activity of related enzymes were investigated in coontail (Ceratophyllum demersum L.) plants to analyze their role in combating the stress caused upon exposure to cadmium (Cd; 0-10 microM) for a duration up to 7d. Plants showed the maximum accumulation of 1293 microg Cd g(-1)dw after 7d at 10 microM. Significant increases in the level of total non-protein thiols (NP-SH) including phytochelatins (PCs) as well as upstream metabolites of the PC biosynthetic pathway, cysteine and glutathione (GSH) were observed. In addition, significant increases in the activities of cysteine synthase (CS), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), glutathione reductase (GR), as well as in vitro activation of phytochelatin synthase (PCS), were noticed in response to Cd. In conclusion, under Cd stress, plants adapted to a new metabolic equilibrium of thiols through coordinated synthesis and consumption to combat Cd toxicity and to accumulate it.', 19097884: 'The use of lignin peroxidase (LIP) as an alternative method for the removal of four catechols (1,2-dihydroxybenzene): catechol (CAT), 4-chlorocatechol (4-CC), 4,5-dichlorocatechol (4,5-DCC) and 4-methylcatechol (4-MC) typical pollutants in wastewater derived from oil and paper industries, was evaluated. The removal of 2mM catecholic substrates by 1 microM LIP after 1h was in the following order: 4,5-DCC (95%)>4-CC(90%)>CAT(55%)>4-MC(43%). Except for 4-MC, all reactions were accompanied by the formation of insoluble products, leading to LIP precipitation. LIP was exposed to soluble or insoluble product-dependent inactivation, depending on the substrates tested, immediately at the start of the reactions. Despite immediate enzyme inactivation, removal of catecholic substrates continued, resulting in oligomeric product formation. Major oxidation products analyzed were compatible with dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric structures. Ether linkages and a benzoquinone structure were detected in two purified oligochlorocatechols. Catechol derivatives removal initiated by LIP, seems to be different for each catecholic substrate in terms of substrate consumption and transformation, and of enzyme activity.', 19097885: 'This paper reports on removal and recovery of copper(II) ions from aqueous solutions under batch experimental conditions using NaOH-pretreated powdered leaves of Marrubium globosum ssp. globosum plant. Experimental results showed that pH was optimized at the value of 5.5 by 16.23 mg/g. The increasing metal concentration and temperature caused an increase in biosorption capacity and the process reached its equilibrium in 60 min. The result obtained from kinetic and isotherm studies resulted in better agreement with pseudo second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. Thermodynamic parameters revealed that the Cu(2+) biosorption by the biomass was an endothermic process. The higher desorption efficiency above 90% was obtained in case of using Na(2)EDTA, K(4)O(7)P(2), HNO(3), HCl, and (NH(4))(2)C(2)O(4) x H(2)O solutions, individually. Reusability of the biomass was examined under consecutive biosorption-desorption cycles repeating five times. The most interesting finding of the study is the idea of utilizing the EDTA-Cu complex, which can be qualified as a residual from desorption processes, as a liquid chemical fertilizer in agricultural applications.', 19111459: 'Cr(VI) removal by Scenedesmus incrassatulus was characterized in a continuous culture system using a split-cylinder internal-loop airlift photobioreactor fed continuously with a synthetic effluent containing 1.0mg Cr(VI) l(-1) at dilution rate (D) of 0.3d (-1). At steady state, there was a small increase (6%) on the dry biomass (DB) concentration of Cr(VI)-treated cultures compared with the control culture. 1.0mg Cr(VI) l(-1) reduced the photosynthetic pigments content and altered the cellular morphology, the gain in dry weight was not affected. At steady state, Cr(VI) removal efficiency was 43.5+/-1.0% and Cr(VI) uptake was 1.7+/-0.1 mg Cr(VI) g(-1) DB.

Initial screening of a total of 100 bacterial isolates, resulted in the selection of one isolate with maximum adsorption capacity of 52.7 mg vanadate/g dry weight. It was tentatively identified as Halomonas sp. according to morphological and biochemical properties and named strain GT-83. Removal of vanadate by biosorption with Halomonas sp. GT-83 was very sensitive to solution pH. Vanadate adsorption decreased with increasing pH, with maximum adsorption capacities achieved in at pH 3.0 in the absence and in the presence of increasing concentrations of salt. Vanadate-salt biosorption studies were also performed at this pH value. Equilibrium uptakes of vanadate increased with increasing vanadate concentration up to 600 mg/l. Maximum metal removal (91.8%) took place at pH 3.0 with initial vanadate concentration of 100mg/l, which got reduced (84.8%) in the presence of 50 g/l salt. The equilibrium sorption data were analyzed by using Freundlich isotherm. The specific uptake of vanadate increased at low cell concentration and decreased when cell concentration exceeded 0.75 g/l.

The present study reports the sorption and degradation of azoxystrobin [methyl (E)-2-{2-(6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl}-3-methoxyacrylate] in a sandy loam soil. The fungicide was moderately sorbed, and the Freundlich adsorption parameter K(f) (1/n) values in natural and 5% compost-amended soils were 9.31 and 13.72, respectively. Sorption showed hysteresis with 32.5 and 14.7% of sorbed fungicide desorbed from the natural and 5% compost-amended soils, respectively. Azoxystrobin was more persistent in the aerobic soil than the anaerobic soil with half-life values of 107.47 and 62.69 days, respectively. Amendment of compost (5%) to the soil enhanced the degradation of fungicide, and the respective half-life values in aerobic and anaerobic soils were 73.39 and 38.58 days, respectively. Azoxystrobin acid was recovered as the only metabolite of azoxystrobin degradation in soils. Both sunlight and UV light affected the persistence of azoxystrobin with fungicide degraded at a faster rate in UV light than in sunlight. Soil acts as a screen and slows the fungicide degradation under sunlight and UV light.', 19143339: 'The efficiency of sodium hydroxide treated rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) leaves powder (NHBL) for removing copper ions from aqueous solutions has been investigated. The effects of physicochemical parameters on biosorption capacities such as stirring speed, pH, biosorbent dose, initial concentrations of copper, and ionic strength were studied. The biosorption capacities of NHBL increased with increase in pH, stirring speed and copper concentration but decreased with increase in biosorbent dose and ionic strength. The isotherm study indicated that NHBL fitted well with Langmuir model compared to Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich models. The maximum biosorption capacity determined from Langmuir isotherm was 14.97 mg/g at 27 degrees C. The kinetic study revealed that pseudosecond order model fitted well the kinetic data, while Boyd kinetic model indicated that film diffusion was the main rate determining step in biosorption process. Based on surface area analysis, NHBL has low surface area and categorized as macroporous. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analyses revealed that hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amino are the main functional groups involved in the binding of copper ions. Complexation was one of the main mechanisms for the removal of copper ions as indicated by FT-IR spectra. Ion exchange was another possible mechanism since the ratio of adsorbed cations (Cu2+ and H+) to the released cations (Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) from NHBL was almost unity. Copper ions bound on NHBL were able to be desorbed at > 99% using 0.05 mol/L HCl, 0.01 mol/L HNO3, and 0.01 mol/L EDTA solutions.', 19143346: 'A strain of photosynthetic bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris W1, isolated from a lab-scale anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) treating textile effluent was demonstrated to decolorize Reactive Black 5 (RB5) efficiently under anaerobic condition. By a series of batch tests, the suitable conditions for RB5 decolorization were obtained, namely, pH < 10, light presence, glutamine or lactate as carbon source with concentration more than 500 mg/L when lactate is selected, NH4Cl as a nitrogen source with concentration more than 100 mg/L, NaCl concentration not exceeding 5%, and RB5 concentration less than 700 mg/L. In addition, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrum scan and High Performance Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) were used to analyze the metabolites of RB5 decolorization of W1. The results showed that partial aromatic amines produced with RB5 reduction were further degraded during the extended period. Anaerobic partial mineralization of RB5 was suggested, and a possible degradation pathway was proposed.', 19156364: 'A novel biphenyl-degrading bacterium, Dyella ginsengisoli LA-4 was isolated from activated sludge. This isolate could utilize biphenyl as sole source of carbon and energy. The resting cells of strain LA-4 could utilize 100 mg/L biphenyl within 20 h, and they were able to degrade 500 mg/L biphenyl within 40 h. The surfactant, Tween 80, could accelerate the biodegradation process. The increase of NaCl concentration inhibited the biphenyl degradation. No biphenyl degradation was detected when the NaCl concentration exceeds 10%. The effects of metal ions on biphenyl degradation were investigated. The results indicated that metal ions such as Cu(2+), Mn(2+), and Co(2+) could completely inhibit the biodegradation of biphenyl, but Mg(2+), Ca(2+), and Zn(2+) had no effects on the degradation of biphenyl. The removal rate was about 64% and 37% in the presence of Fe(3+) and Ni(2+), respectively. This study suggested that strain LA-4 could be widely used for bioremediation of soil and wastewater contaminated by biphenyl, NaCl, and metal ions.', 19156367: 'High salt concentration and salinity fluctuations in wastewater challenge the efficiency of microbial strains used for cleanup of pollutants. In this study, it was investigated that the new isolated Arthrobacter sp. W1 degraded mixed phenolic compounds under complex salt conditions. The results showed that Arthrobacter sp. W1 was able to utilize various phenolic compounds as carbon source under high salt conditions. It can degrade phenol and p-cresol mixture at 10% NaCl, although rates of degradation and cell growth were lower compared to 5% NaCl. The presence of trace p-cresol significantly inhibited phenol biodegradation. When salinity fluctuations were between 1% and 10% NaCl, strain W1 was able to degrade substrates and survived. It was also suggested that the presence of salts (i.e., NaCl, KCl, Na(2)SO(4), and K(2)SO(4)) had almost no effects on the microbial growth and biodegradation process. Therefore, Arthrobacter sp. W1 would be a promising candidate for bioremediation of phenolic compounds under complex salt conditions.', 19162294: 'To assess the possible effect that surfactants commonly found in the aquatic environment may have on the remediation potential of the salt marsh plant Halimione portulacoides, a non-ionic (Triton X-100) and an anionic (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) surfactants were used. Experiments were carried out in the laboratory, either in hydroponics (sediment elutriate) or in sediment soaked in elutriate, using sediment and water from an estuarine salt marsh (Cávado River, NW Portugal). Groups of H. portulacoides (grown in a greenhouse) were exposed for 6d to media with 0.16mM added Cu(II) in the absence and in the presence of each one of the two selected surfactants, at concentrations lower than the respective micellar critical concentration. Cu was determined in solutions, sediments and in different plant tissues before and after experiments. Plant photosynthetic efficiency did not indicate deletory effects of the exposure to the added pollutants. The non-ionic surfactant Triton X-100 and, to a lesser extent, the anionic surfactant SDS too, favored Cu accumulation in the plant roots but not Cu translocation, indicating that surfactants may favor Cu adsorption to the roots (phytostabilization). On the other hand, both surfactants favored Cu solubility from the sediment. Therefore, the presence of surfactants, which are frequently found in estuarine areas, as a result of urban and industrial effluent discharges, may condition metal distribution in those environments.', 19186827: 'This study focused on the effects of decolorization products of reactive black 5 (RB5) on anaerobic decolorization of direct yellow 11 (DY11) by Rhodopseudomonas palustris W1 and its reaction mechanisms. The results showed that the decolorization products of RB5 could obviously accelerate biological decolorization rate of DY11. For initial concentration of 200 mg/L of DY11, the addition of decolorization products of RB5 resulted in that the decolorization kinetic constant K was increased from 17 mg/(L x h) to 42.5 mg/(L x h), followed by an further increase to 48.8 mg/(L x h) after optimization of RB5 supplement. Cyclic voltammogram analysis demonstrated that the decolorization products of RB5 presented electrochemical activity due to the presence of redox electron transfer mediators, as indicated by an observation of two current peaks of reversible oxidation and reduction appeared at potential of ca. 83 mV and -200 mV, respectively. According to LC-MS and FT-IR analysis, the electrochemically activated species of the decolorization products were characterized to be 7-amino-8-hydroxy-1, 2-naphthaquinone-3, 6-disulphonate-1, 2-diimine (TAHNDSDP-1). TAHNDSDP-1 with quinine-like structure was able to transfer between its oxidative and reductive forms by transferring 2[H], which was supposed to be the redox mediator to shuttle electrons from electron donors to azo dyes, thus, improving the reduction of de materials.', 19191667: 'Retinal transplantation experiments have advanced considerably during recent years, but remaining diseased photoreceptor cells in the host retina physically obstruct the development of graft-host neuronal contacts that are required for vision. We here report selective removal of photoreceptors using the biodegradable elastomer poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS). A 1\\u2009×\\u20093\\u2009mm PGS membrane was implanted in the subretinal space of normal rabbit eyes, and morphologic specimens were examined with hematoxylin and eosin staining and a panel of immunohistochemical markers. Seven days postoperatively, a patent separation of the neuroretina and retinal pigment epithelium was found as well as loss of several rows of photoreceptors in combination with massive terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining for apoptosis in the outer nuclear layer. After 28 days, the neuroretina was reattached, the PGS membrane had degraded, and photoreceptors were absent in the implantation area. Activated Müller cells were found in the entire retina in 7-day specimens, and in the implantation area after 28 days. AII amacrine and rod bipolar cell morphology was not affected, except for disrupted dendritic branching, which was present in rod bipolar cells in 28-day specimens. We conclude that retinal detachment induced by the biodegradable PGS membrane creates a permissive environment in which graft-host neuronal connections may be facilitated in future retinal transplantation experiments.', 19192786: 'Manganese oxides are widespread in the environment and their surface reactivity has the potential to modifythe geochemical behavior of uranium. We have investigated the effect of different concentrations of U and Mn on the coupled biogeochemical oxidation-reduction reactions of U and Mn. Experiments conducted in the presence of Mn(II)-oxidizing spores from Bacillus sp. strain SG-1 and 5% headspace oxygen show that the Mn oxides produced by these spores can rapidly oxidize UO2. Thirty to fifty times more UO2 is oxidized in the presence of Mn oxides compared to Mn oxide free controls. As a consequence of this U02 oxidation, Mn oxides are reduced to soluble Mn(II) that can be reoxidized by SG-1 spores. SG-1 spores cannot directly oxidize U02, but U02 oxidation proceeds rapidly with Mn(II) concentrations of <5 microM. The rate of UO2 oxidation is equal to the rate of MnO2 reduction with UO2 oxidation controlled by the initial concentrations of UO2, dissolved Mn(II) (in systems with spores), or Mn(IV) oxides (in systems containing preformed MnO2). U(VI) and UO2 decrease the Mn(II) oxidation rate in different ways by inhibiting the Mn(II)-oxidizing enzyme or decreasing the available Mn(II). These results emphasize the need to consider the impact of Mn(II)-oxidizing bacteria when predicting the potential for U02 oxidation in the subsurface.', 19192795: 'An important feature of microbial communities is the spatial heterogeneity of extracellular chemistry. Scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) was used to map the spatial distribution of iron speciesthroughout Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms to assess the influence of chemical heterogeneity on biomineralization. P. aeruginosa biofilms were treated with Fe(III)-amended media. Speciation and quantitative mapping using STXM image sequences in the Fe 2p(3/2) (L3) absorption edge region revealed both Fe(II) and Fe(III) in localized microenvironments. Fe(III) was mainly associated with cell surfaces, while small amounts of Fe(II) was found in the extracellular space. Biofilms were also characterized using C 1s edge STXM image sequences. Anaerobic growth assays and confocal microscopy revealed the inability of P. aeruginosa to directly reduce Fe(III), implicating indirect iron reduction mechanisms in the formation of fine-grained, multivalent minerals. These studies suggest that geochemical microenvironments found throughout microbial communities are even more complex than previously believed.', 19238968: 'Bacteria regulate specific group behaviors such as biofilm formation in response to population density using small signal molecules called autoinducers (quorum sensing, QS). In this study, the concept of bacterial QS was applied to membrane bioreactors (MBRs) for advanced wastewater treatment as a new biofouling control paradigm. The research was conducted in three phases: (1) demonstrate the presence of the autoinducer signal in MBRs, (2) correlate QS activity and membrane biofouling, (3) apply QS-based membrane biofouling control. A bioassay with Agrobacterium tumefaciens reporter strain proved that N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) autoinducers were produced in the MBR. Furthermore, thin-layer chromatographic analysis identified at least three different AHLs in the biocake, of which N-octanoyl-homoserine lactone was the most abundant During continuous MBR operation, the biocake showed strong AHL activity simultaneously with abrupt increase in the transmembrane pressure, which implies that QS is in close association with membrane biofouling. Porcine kidney acylase I, which can inactivate the AHL molecule by amide bond cleavage, was confirmed to prevent membrane biofouling by quenching AHL autoinducers. From these results, it was concluded that QS could be a novel target for biofouling control in MBRs.', 19301130: 'Fast development of ionic liquids as gaining more and more attention valuable chemicals will undoubtedly lead to environmental pollution. New formulations and application of ionic liquids may result in contamination in the presence of hydrophobic compounds, such as petroleum mixtures. We hypothesize that in the presence of diesel fuel low-water-soluble ionic liquids may become more toxic to hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms. In this study the influence of 1-alkoxymethyl-2-methyl-5-hydroxypyridinium chloride homologues (side-chain length from C(3) to C(18)) on biodegradation of diesel fuel by a bacterial consortium was investigated. Whereas test performed for the consortium cultivated on disodium succinate showed that toxicity of the investigated ionic liquids decreased with increase in side-chain length, only higher homologues (C(8)-C(18)) caused a decrease in diesel fuel biodegradation. As a result of exposure to toxic compounds also modification in cell surface hydrophobicity was observed (MATH). Disulphine blue active substances method was employed to determine partitioning index of ionic liquids between water and diesel fuel phase, which varied from 1.1 to 51% for C(3) and C(18) homologues, respectively. We conclude that in the presence of hydrocarbons acting as a solvent, the increased bioavailability of hydrophobic homologues is responsible for the decrease in biodegradation efficiency of diesel fuel.', 19303625: 'The site of the 2000 Olympic Games (Sydney Olympic Park (SOP), Sydney, Australia) was contaminated by persistent organic pollutants (POPs) prior to remediation in the 1990s. This study investigates the bioactivity of POPs in the sediment and water of wetlands across SOP by in vitro 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalence (TCDDeq) measurement (H4IIE cell line bioassay). Further, it examines whether disturbance of these sediments is likely to mobilise ligands for this receptor into the water column. Exposure to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) ligands was measured in vivo using hepatic cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) induction (EROD) in the mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). Aqueous TCDDeq ranged from 0.013 to 0.057 pM in SOP wetlands which was significantly (p<0.05) less that in urban reference sites. These concentrations were not correlated to physical or chemical characteristics of the wetlands. In the sediments, TCDDeq ranged from 0.0016 to 7.06 microg/kg and these were not significantly (p>or=0.05) different to that measured in urban reference sites. Simulated disturbance of small quantities of sediment in water samples significantly (p<0.05) increased the levels of TCDDeq measured in the water. Sediment TCDDeq was correlated to sediment SigmaPAH concentration in 2006 and sediment SigmaPCB, SigmaDDT concentrations and fine sediment grain size in 2005. While fish at one SOP wetland had hepatic EROD activity elevated above the estimated basal level for this species, these were at the lower end of the range measured in urban impacted, non-remediated wetlands. EROD activity was positively correlated with both the sediment SigmaPCB load and aqueous TCDDeq. Increased catchment size was correlated with increased EROD activity suggesting an even spread of POPs throughout the residential areas of the Sydney metropolitan area. The concentration of bioactive POPs in the wetlands of SOP is therefore low relative to urban reference sites demonstrating the ongoing success of the remediation program.', 19395246: 'Resveratrol (Res) has been reported to elicit many cellular responses including cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and apoptosis. This makes it a novel and potential anticancer agent. Moreover, the lipophilicity of Res raises the possibility of its application as a potential model drug in nanoparticle based delivery systems. Resveratrol is incorporated into mPEG-PCL based nanoparticles with high encapsulation efficiency due to its lipophilicity. The significant finding of the current study is that Res-loaded nanoparticles at lower concentration could lead to significantly higher cell death compared to equivalent dose of free Res and this difference of cytotoxicity could not be abrogated by the antioxidant Vitamin E. Furthermore, free Res shows significant less cytotoxicity than the equivalent dose of Res-loaded nanoparticles with the preconditioning of Vitamin E. Meanwhile, reactive oxygen species (ROS) determination revealed the significantly lower intracellular ROS levels in Res-treated cells compared to nanoparticle-treated cells. Therefore, the differential cytotoxicity between Res and Res-loaded nanoparticles may be mediated by the discrepancy of intracellular ROS levels. The present results suggest that Res-loaded nanoparticles could be a potential useful chemotherapeutic formulation for malignant glioma therapy and the development of traditional Chinese medicine with nanoscale drug formation warrants more intensive research in order to evaluate its clinical feasibility.', 19402419: 'Carbendazim, a systemic benzimidazole fungicide, is applied repeatedly to control plant diseases including soilborne diseases, over a growing season. Studies were carried out under laboratory conditions to assess the effects of repeated carbendazim applications on its persistence and microbial community in soil. The results indicate that dissipation of carbendazim in soil was accelerated with its application frequency. The degradation rate constant of carbendazim was increased significantly from 0.074 d(-1) to 0.79 d(-1). The corresponding half-life was shorten markedly from 9.3 d to 0.9 d after four repeated applications. No significant inhibitory effect of carbendazim on soil microbial utilization of the carbon sources was observed after first treatment, but a slight increase in average well color development (AWCD) was shown after second, third, and fourth applications. It suggested that soil microorganisms become adapted to carbendazim after repeated application. Simpson and Shannon indexes of soil microbial community from carbendazim treated soil were also similar to those from the control soil, indicating that the richness and dominant character of soil microorganisms remain unchangeable after repeated application. However, after first, second, and third addition of carbendazim, McIntosh indexes on day 21 were significantly higher compared with the control, suggesting that balance of soil microorganisms was altered due to the enrichment of the specific carbendazim-adapting strains in soil.', 19423337: 'The photo-Fenton coupled with a biological system for the removal of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) in wastewater was analyzed. The toxicity of DEHP-containing wastewater was found to be reduced after pretreatment by the photo-Fenton reaction. The effect of different factors, such as DEHP, Fe(3+) and H(2)O(2) concentrations and the reaction time, on degradation efficiency was investigated. The optimal time to stop the pretreatment process and introduce the effluent to the biological system was 60 min. The results show that effluent of DEHP-containing wastewater pretreated by the photo-Fenton method is biodegradable and that mineralization can be completed when the wastewater is subsequently treated in a biological system. The coupled Fenton and biological treatment system for the degradation of DEHP-containing wastewater can be successfully performed in a semi-continuous mode. These results indicate that the coupled photo-biological system is an effective and potential method for the treatment of DEHP-containing wastewater.', 19427015: 'The objective of this study was to evaluate the extent of improvement in the biodegradability of persistent organic compounds by pre-oxidation by using Sequential Batch Reactors (SBRs). Dichlorodiethyl ether (DCDE), a non-biodegradable compound, was used as a test chemical. Ozonation, Fenton reagent and ultra-violet light coupled with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H(2)O(2)) were used for oxidation of DCDE at levels of 50-100%. Pre-oxidized DCDE solutions were then subjected to SBR studies using activated sludge to determine the rate and extent of biodegradation of oxidation by-products. The results indicated that the biodegradability of pre-oxidized DCDE increased drastically, reaching an average of 90% for all three oxidation methods versus zero for non-oxidized DCDE. It was concluded that the results of SBR experiments may be better indicators of biodegradability of chemically-oxidized wastewaters due to significant acclimation of microorganisms in SBRs, which cannot be observed in conventional respirometric laboratory studies.', 19468841: 'Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH; naphthalene, anthracene and phenanthrene) degrading microbial consortium C2PL05 was obtained from a sandy soil chronically exposed to petroleum products, collected from a petrochemical complex in Puertollano (Ciudad Real, Spain). The consortium C2PL05 was highly efficient degrading completely naphthalene, phenanthrene and anthracene in around 18 days of cultivation. The toxicity (Microtox method) generated by the PAH and by the intermediate metabolites was reduced to levels close to non-toxic in almost 40 days of cultivation. The identified bacteria from the contaminated soil belonged to gamma-proteobacteria and could be include in Enterobacter and Pseudomonas genus. DGGE analysis revealed uncultured Stenotrophomonas ribotypes as a possible PAH degrader in the microbial consortium. The present work shows the potential use of these microorganisms and the total consortium for the bioremediation of PAH polluted areas since the biodegradation of these chemicals takes place along with a significant decrease in toxicity.', 19468842: 'Bacillus sp. VUS decolorized azo dye Navy blue 2GL in 48 h at static anoxic condition in yeast extract medium, whereas it took only 18 h for the decolorization in presence of CaCl(2). Different inducers played role in the decolorization of Navy blue 2GL. CaCl(2) found to be the most effective inducer among all inducers tested. The activity of enzymes like lignin peroxidase, laccase and reductases viz. NADH-DCIP, azo and riboflavin induced during decolorization represents their role in the biodegradation. Extracellular LiP and intracellular laccase activity induced with CaCl(2). Yeast extract was best medium for faster decolorization than other media. UV-vis spectrophotometer analysis and visual examinations showed decolorization of dye. High performance liquid chromatography, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy showed degradation of dye. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy revealed formation of 4-Amino-3-(2-bromo-4, 6-dinitro-phenylazo)-phenol and acetic acid 2-(-acetoxy-ethylamino)-ethyl ester as final products. Bacillus sp. VUS also decolorized synthetic effluent. Phytotoxicity study showed detoxification of Navy blue 2GL.', 19496634: \"Heavy metals can significantly affect the kinetics of substrate biodegradation and microbial growth, including lag times and specific growth rates. A model to describe microbial metabolic lag as a function of the history of substrate concentration has been previously described by Wood et al. (Water Resour Res 31:553-563) and Ginn (Water Resour Res 35:1395-1408). In the present study, this model is extended by including the effect of heavy metals on metabolic lag by developing an inhibitor-dependent functional to account for the metabolic state of the microorganisms. The concentration of the inhibiting metal is explicitly incorporated into the functional. The validity of the model is tested against experimental data on the effects of zinc on Pseudomonas species isolated from Lake Coeur d'Alene sediments, Idaho, U.S.A., as well as the effects of nickel or cobalt on a mixed microbial culture collected from the aeration tank of a wastewater treatment plant in Athens, Greece. The simulations demonstrate the ability to incorporate the effect of metals on metabolism through lag, yield coefficient, and specific growth rates. The model includes growth limitation due to insufficient transfer of oxygen into the growth medium.\", 19501506: 'In the work described here, a biotrickling filter with Thiobacillus thioparus (ATCC 23645) immobilized on polyurethane foam is proposed for the removal of hydrogen sulfide contained in air. The effect of surface velocity of the recirculation medium (5.9-1.2 m/h), sulfate concentration inhibition (3.0-10.7 g/L), pH (6.0-8.2), empty bed residence time (EBRT) (150-11 s) for constant loads of 11.5 and 2.9 g S/m(3)/h, and pressure drop of the system were investigated. The total amount of biomass immobilized on the carrier was 8.2+/-1.3x10(10) cells/g. The optimal values of the operating variables were: pH between 7.0 and 7.5, surface velocity of 5.9 m/h and sulfate concentration below 5 g/L. The critical EC value was 14.9 g S/m(3)/h (removal efficiency of 99.8%) and the EC(max) was 55.0 g S/m(3)/h (removal efficiency of 79.8%) for an EBRT of 150 s. For loads of 2.89+/-0.05 and 11.5+/-0.1 g S/m(3)/h, the removal efficiency was higher than 99% for an EBRT over 90 s.', 19517253: \"Soil samples collected from dye contaminated sites of Vatva, Gujarat, India were studied for the screening and isolation of organisms capable of decolourizing textile dyes. The most efficient isolate, which showed decolourization zone of 48 mm on 300 ppm Reactive Red BS (C.I.111) containing plate, was identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Reactive Red BS (C.I.111) was used as a model dye for the study. The isolated culture exhibited 91% decolourization of 300 ppm dye within 5.5 h over a wide pH range from 5.0 to 10.5 and temperature ranging from 30 to 40 degrees C. The culture was able to decolourize more than 91% of Reactive Red BS under static conditions in presence of either glucose, peptone or yeast extract. Addition of 300 ppm of Reactive Red BS, in each step, in ongoing dye decolourization flask, gave more than 90% decolourization within 2 h corresponding to 136 mg l(-1) h(-1) dye removal rate. The isolate had the ability to decolourize six different reactive dyes tested as well as the actual dye manufacturing industry's effluent. The degradation of the dye was confirmed by HPTLC.\", 19520412: 'Chloroacetanilide herbicides are frequently detected in groundwater and surface waters, and pose high risks to aquatic biota. In this study, sodium bisulfite (NaHSO(3)), a plant growth regulator used in China, was used to remove three chloroacetanilide herbicides including alachlor, acetochlor and S-metolachlor. These herbicides were rapidly dechlorinated by NaHSO(3) in neutral conditions. The dechlorination was accelerated with increasing pH, temperature and NaHSO(3) concentrations. Kinetic analysis and mass spectrum identification revealed that the reaction followed S(N)2 nucleophilic substitution, in which the chlorine was replaced by the reactive specie sulfite. Alachlor and its isomer acetochlor had similar reaction rates, whereas they were more readily transformed than S-metolachlor that had larger steric hindrance and weaker electrophilicity. The transformation products were chloroacetanilide ethane sulfonic acids (ESAs), which were also encountered as major metabolites of these herbicides in natural environment via common metabolic pathways and were less toxic to green algae compared to the parent herbicides. These results indicate that NaHSO(3) can accelerate transformation of chloroacetanilide herbicides to the less toxic transformation products by nucleophilic substitution and dechlorination in aquatic environment. NaHSO(3) can be potentially used for the removal of chloroacetanilide herbicides from wastewater effluent, spill sites and accidental discharge.', 19534135: 'A mechanistic model describing the steady-state biodegradation of inhibitory pollutants by algal-bacterial consortia in enclosed chemostat photobioreactors was developed. The modelwasthenvalidated againstexperimentaldataonsalicylate removal by a Chlorella Sorokiniana/Ralstonia basilensis consortium cultivated without external O2 supplied in an enclosed chemostat photobioreactor under various conditions of photon flux radiation, salicylate inlet concentrations, temperatures, and hydraulic retention times (HRT). A satisfactory fit of experimental data was achieved in both the fitting and validation data sets (11% of average relative error). The model was thus capable of describing satisfactorily the influence of the HRT and the combined increase of light input and temperature on salicylate removal efficiency (RE). The potential inhibitory effect of salicylate was considered into the model structure based on the influence of salicylate concentration on microalgae photosynthetic activity. Only four adjustable parameters were necessary when using this modeling approach, which significantly reduces the number of experimental kinetic and stoichiometric coefficients needed for process description. Variables such as reactor geometry and light absorption characteristics of the biomass were grouped into a single parameter, which highly simplifies photobioreactor modeling. Being based on stoichiometric, thermodynamic, and mass balances analysis, this model can be extended to the removal of any organic pollutant in industrial wastewaters and to any photobioreactor configuration. It therefore provides an important tool to assess the feasibility of pollutant biodegradation under full photosynthetic oxygenation (i.e., no external O2 supply) and to optimize photobioreactors by establishing the conditions under which complete pollutant removal can be achieved. The model herein developed also provides a tool to better understand the complex relationships between microalgae, bacteria, light, and pollutant concentration, which will promote the development of algal-bacterial processes as a cost-effective alternative for wastewater reclamation and algae production from wastewater.', 19534152: 'Euglena gracilis is a photosynthetic eukaryote ubiquitous in arsenic-polluted acid mine drainages and is locally exposed to As(III) and As(V) concentrations up to 250 and 100 mg L(-1), respectively. Here, arsenic speciation in E. graciliswas determined by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and selected (bio)chemical methods on cells grown at nonlimiting phosphate concentrations. Our results suggest the following detoxification scheme: (1) uptake of As(V) from solution in competition with phosphate, (2) intracellular reduction to As(III), (3) complexation by cytoplasmic proteic thiol ligands of low molecular weight, and (4) As(III) export from the cell. However, at As(V) concentrations >100 mg L(-1), growth rate is markedly lowered and As(V) remains mostly unreduced during the extended lag period. Intracellular As(V) is found to be exclusively concentrated in the membrane + nucleus fraction, suggesting that arsenate could substitute for phosphate groups in membranes or in phosphate-containing macromolecules. Thus, arsenic species are partitioned, with As(III)-thiol compounds concentrated in the cytoplasmic proteic pool and As(V)-compounds associated with the membrane + nucleus fraction. The increasing growth delay observed with increasing initial As(V) concentration in the culture medium is proposed to result from the combination of a higher As(V) uptake and limiting intracellular As(V) reduction rate and As(III) export rate. Under high As(V) exposure conditions (200 mg L(-1)) the reduction step is found to be the most limiting step for detoxification.', 19540106: 'A bacterial strain, BW003, which utilized quinoline as its sole C, N and energy source, was isolated and identified as Pseudomonas sp. BW003 degraded 192-911 mg/l quinoline within 3-8 h with removal rates ranging from 96% to 98%. The optimum conditions for the degradation were 30 degrees C and pH 8. In the process of biodegradation, at least 43% of quinoline was transformed into 2-hydroxyquinoline, then 0.69% of 2-hydroxyquinoline was transformed into 2,8-dihydroxyquinoline, and then, presumably, into 8-hydroxycoumarin. Meanwhile, at least 48% of the nitrogen in quinoline was directly transformed into ammonia-N. An extra carbon source enhanced the nitrogen transformation from ammonia-N. Further experiments showed that, besides cell synthesis, BW003 transformed less than 6% of ammonia-N into nitrate through heterotrophic nitrification. In addition, BW003 contained a large plasmid, which may be involved in quinoline metabolism. The study indicates that quinoline and its metabolic products can be eliminated from wastewater by controlling the C/N ratio using BW003 as the bioaugmentation inoculum.', 19540107: 'A soil bacterium strain, capable of using p-nitrophenol (PNP) as its sole source of carbon and energy, was isolated by enrichment on minimal salt medium (MSM). On the basis of a phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences the bacterium is a species of Arthrobacter, closely related to Arthrobacter ureafaciens DSM 20126. This strain has an unusually high substrate tolerance for PNP degradation in MSM. Greatest degradation of PNP was observed at 30 degrees C and under slightly alkaline pH (pH 7-9) conditions. Effective degradation rates slowed as the concentration of PNP was increased. Addition of glucose from 0.1% to 0.5% generally enhanced the degradation of PNP at high concentration (400 mg/l) although acidification as a result of glucose metabolism had a negative effect on PNP depletion. Biodegradation of PNP at high concentration was greatly accelerated by beta-cyclodextrin at a concentration of 0.5%, indicating that beta-cyclodextrin could be a promising addictive for effective PNP bioremediation.', 19541478: 'Simultaneous Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation were investigated in a reactor containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa CCTCC AB91095. Phenol was used as carbon source. P.aeruginosa utilized metabolites formed during phenol degradation as energy source for Cr(VI) reduction. Cr(VI) inhibited both Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation when Cr(VI) concentration exceeded the optimum value (20 mg/L), whereas phenol enhanced both Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation below the optimum initial concentration of 100 mg/L. Cr(III) was the predominant product of Cr(VI) reduction in cultures after incubation for 24 h. Both Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation were influenced by the amount of inocula. The concentration of Cr(VI) and phenol declined quickly from 20, 100 to 3.36, 29.51 mg/L in cultures containing of 5% (v/v) inoculum after incubation for 12 h, respectively. The whole study showed that P. aeruginosa is promising for the reduction of toxic Cr(VI) and degradation of organic pollutants simultaneously in the mineral liquid medium.', 19543983: 'Stenotrophomonas sp. RMSK capable of degrading acenaphthylene as a sole source of carbon and energy was isolated from coal sample. Metabolites produced were analyzed and characterized by TLC, HPLC and mass spectrometry. Identification of naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid, 1-naphthoic acid, 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, salicylate and detection of key enzymes namely 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase, salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase and catechol-1,2-dioxygenase in the cell free extract suggest that acenaphthylene metabolized via 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, salicylate and catechol. The terminal metabolite, catechol was then metabolized by catechol-1,2-dioxygenase to cis,cis-muconic acid, ultimately forming TCA cycle intermediates. Based on these studies, the proposed metabolic pathway in strain RMSK is, acenaphthylene --> naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid --> 1-naphthoic acid --> 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene --> salicylic acid --> catechol --> cis,cis-muconic acid.', 19564104: \"The laccase of Trametes versicolor was immobilized on the functionalized nanoparticles SBA-15 with the average diameter less than 10 nm. Laccase mediated oxidations of anthracene (ANT) were investigated in the presence of two mediators, 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT). Oxidation of ANT was more efficiently enhanced by adding 1 mM of HBT than that by adding ABTS. After 48 h oxidation HBT group significantly oxidized ANT with residue 58% relative to 88% in the ABTS group. HPLC and GC/MS analyses indicated the main product of ANT oxidation was anthraquinone (ANQ). The fluorescein diacetate (FDA) uptake of two human cell lines was used to assess the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of ANT and ANQ. Treatments with ANT and ANQ at 5 and 10 microM exhibited significant cytotoxicity to the HaCaT cells and the A3 lymphocytes and no significant genotoxicity was observed. The results illustrated that ANQ is less toxic than ANT as well.\", 19590954: 'The heavy metal (Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cd) accumulation capacity of the stem cuttings of the terrestrial, ornamental plant, Talinum triangulare was assessed in hydroponic medium. The stem cuttings of T. triangulare, grew well in distilled water regenerating roots and aerial parts. On exposure to various concentrations of Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cd, a concentration dependent decrease was observed in the number of leaves produced and roots regenerated and an increase in the number of days required for the initiation of roots. The number of leaves produced showed an increasing trend in almost all treatment concentrations of Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cd with an increase in the duration of experiment, whereas, with an increase in the treatment concentration of metals a significant (P < 0.05) decrease was observed in the number of leaves produced. The number of days required for root initiation in metal solutions, however, increased with increasing concentration of Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cd. The root development was completely arrested from 10 mg l(-1) of Ni and 4 mg l(-1) of Cd. Compared to the control, a significant decrease was recorded in the number of roots produced in all treatment concentrations of Cu, Pb, Ni, and Cd. Pink colouration of metal solution consequent to leaching of plant pigment from T. triangulare was observed which was not persistent and disappeared after a few days. Decaying of stem was observed when exposed to Ni and Cd but not to Cu and Pb. Although, copper accumulation by T. triangulare at treatment concentration of 15 and 20 mg l(-1) exceeded 1,000 mg kg(-1) dry matter, necessary pot culture experiment is required before \"T. triangulare\" can be definitely classified as a Cu hyperaccumulator.', 19596135: \"The reductive dechlorination and biodegradation of 2,2(')4,5,5(')-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB#101) was investigated in a laboratory-scale. Palladium coated iron (Pd/Fe) was used as a catalytic reductant for the chemical degradation of 2,2(')4,5,5(')-pentachlorobiphenyl, and an aerobic bacteria was used for biodegradation following the chemical reaction in this study. Dechlorination was affected by several factors such as Pd loading, initial soil pH and the amount of Pd/Fe used. The results showed that higher Pd loading, higher dosage of Pd/Fe and slightly acid condition were beneficial to the catalytic dechlorination of 2,2('),4,5,5(')-pentachlorobiphenyl. In laboratory batch experiments, 2,2(')4,5,5(')-pentachlorobiphenyl was reduced in the presence of Pd/Fe bimetal, which was not further degraded by aerobic bacteria. 2,2('),4-trichlorobiphenyl (PCB#17), a reduction product from 2,2(')4,5,5(')-pentachlorobiphenyl, was readily biodegraded in the presence of a aerobic bacterial strain.

Hairy roots of Tagetes were able to remove dye concentrations up to 110 mg L(-l) and could be successively used at least for five consecutive decolorization cycles. The hairy roots of Tagetes decolorized six different dyes, viz. Golden Yellow HER, Methyl Orange, Orange M2RL, Navy Blue HE2R, Reactive Red M5B and Reactive Red 198. Significant induction of the activity of biotransformation enzymes indicated their crucial role in the dye metabolism. UV-vis spectroscopy, HPLC and FTIR spectroscopy analyses confirmed the degradation of Reactive Red 198. A possible pathway for the biodegradation of Reactive Red 198 has been proposed with the help of GC-MS and metabolites identified as 2-aminonaphthol, p-aminovinylsulfone ethyl disulfate and 1-aminotriazine, 3-pyridine sulfonic acid. The phytotoxicity study demonstrated the non-toxic nature of the extracted metabolites. The use of such hairy root cultures with a high ability for bioremediation of dyes is discussed.', 19629577: 'Freshwaters include some of the most impaired systems on Earth with high rates of species loss, underscoring the significance of investigating whether ecosystems with fewer species will be able to maintain ecological processes. The environmental context is expected to modulate the effects of declining diversity. We conducted microcosm experiments manipulating fungal inoculum diversity and zinc concentration to test the hypothesis that fungal diversity determines the susceptibility of leaf litter decomposition to Zn stress. Realized fungal diversity was estimated by counting released spores and by measuring species-specific biomasses via denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. In the absence of Zn, positive diversity effects were found for leaf mass loss and fungal biomass through complementary interactions and due to the presence of key species. The variability of leaf decomposition decreased with increasing species number (portfolio effect), particularly under Zn stress. Results suggest that the effect of species loss on ecosystem stability may be exacerbated at higher stress levels.', 19683433: 'Epoxy modified Mesua ferrea L. seed oil (MFLSO) based polyurethane nanocomposites with different weight % of clay loadings (1%, 2.5% and 5%) have been evaluated as biocompatible materials. The nanocomposites were prepared by ex situ solution technique under high mechanical shearing and ultrasonication at room temperature. The partially exfoliated nanocomposites were characterized by Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. The mechanical properties such as tensile strength and scratch hardness were improved 2 and 5 times, respectively by nanocomposites formation. Even the impact resistance improved a little. The thermostability of the nanocomposites was enhanced by about 40 degrees C. Biodegradation study confirmed 5-10 fold increase in biodegradation rate for the nanocomposites compared to the pristine polymers. All the nanocomposites showed non-cytotoxicity as evident from RBC hemolysis inhibition observed in anti-hemolytic assay carried over the sterilized films. The study reveals that the epoxy modified MFLSO based polyurethane nanocomposites deserve the potential to be applicable as biomaterials.', 19692228: 'The biomass of Corynebacterium glutamicum was treated with poly(amic acid) to improve the biosorption of Basic Blue 3 (BB3) from aqueous solution. The grafting of poly(amic acid) onto the biomass surface increased the density of the carboxyl groups. The UV-spectrum revealed that strong acidic (pH2) and basic conditions (pH11) resulted in the precipitation of BB3. Therefore, pH edge experiments were conducted only within the range 3-10; these results indicated that electrostatic attraction between carboxyl groups of C. glutamicum and BB3 dye cations was favored under alkaline conditions. From the Langmuir model, poly(amic acid)-modified biomass gave a maximum uptake of 173.6 mg/g at pH 9, compared to 52.8 mg/g by the raw biomass. The biosorption kinetics was found to be fast; with equilibrium attained within 10 min. The increase in the ionic strength strongly affected the uptake of BB3 for both forms of C. glutamicum.', 19692233: 'This study presents the improved biodegradation of Congo red, a toxic azo dye, using mutant Bacillus sp. obtained by random mutagenesis of wild Bacillus sp. using UV and ethidium bromide. The mutants obtained were screened based on their decolorization performance and best mutants were selected for further studies. Better decolorization was observed in the initial Congo red concentration range 100-1000 mg/l for wild species whereas mutant strain was found to offer better decolorization up to 3000 mg/l. Mutant strain offered 12-30% reduction in time required for the complete decolorization by wild strain. The optimum pH and temperature were found to be 7.0 and 37 degrees C, respectively. Two efficient strains such as Bacillus sp. ACT 1 and Bacillus sp. ACT 2 were isolated from the various mutants obtained. Bacillus sp. ACT 2 showed improved enzymatic production and Bacillus sp. ACT 1 showed improved growth compared to wild strain. The enzyme responsible for the degradation was found to be azoreductase by SDS-PAGE and about 53% increased production of enzyme was achieved with mutant species. The experimental data were modeled using growth and substrate inhibition models.', 19692235: 'The aim of this study was to investigate the biodegradable chelating agents S,S-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (SS-EDDS) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) as potential alternatives and compare them with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for effectiveness. Extraction of heavy metals from chromated copper arsenate (CCA)-treated wood with EDDS, NTA, or EDTA solvent was evaluated at various solvent pH levels and stoichiometric ratios.

Experiments have been carried out to find the effect of various parameters such as initial cadmium concentration, experimental pH and temperature on the biosorption potential of H. valentiae. Optimum pH for biosorption of cadmium was found to be 6+/-0.3. A maximum removal of about 17mg of cadmium per g of micro algae was observed at pH 6.0 for 250mgL(-1) solution of cadmium. Kinetics of cadmium biosorption by H. valentiae biomass is better described by pseudo first order kinetic model. The equilibrium isotherm data are very well represented by Langmuir isotherm equation, which confirmed the monolayer coverage of cadmium onto H. valentiae biomass. Various thermodynamic parameters such as change in enthalpy, free energy and entropy were estimated. It was also clearly observed that the presence of neutral salts and other metal ions affected the cadmium uptake behavior of the biomass considerably.', 19717238: 'The aim of the present study was to explore the potential for using vermicompost from olive-mill waste as an organic amendment for enhanced bioremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)-contaminated soils. The focus was to analyse the genetic potential and the naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) expression of the bacterial communities involved in the degradation of naphthalene, as chemical model for the degradation of PAH. The structure of the metabolically active bacterial population was evidenced in the RNA-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles. The relative expression of NDO was determined with real-time PCR in both the soil and the vermicompost cDNA. Naphthalene changed the structure of the metabolically active bacterial community in the vermicompost when this was artificially contaminated. When used as amendment, naphthalene-free vermicompost modified the bacterial population in the PAH-contaminated soil, evidenced in the DGGE gels after 1 month of incubation. In the amended soil, the vermicompost enhanced the NDO enzyme expression with a concomitant biodegradation of naphthalene. The effect of the vermicompost was to induce the expression of biodegradation indicator genes in the autochthonous bacterial community and/or incorporate new bacterial species capable of degrading PAH. The results indicated that vermicompost from olive-mill wastes could be considered a suitable technology to be used in PAH bioremediation.', 19748180: 'The crude recycling of electronic and electric waste (e-waste) is now creating soil pollution problems with organic compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The present study aimed to compare the phytoremediation potential of four plant species (rice, alfalfa, ryegrass and tall fescue) for PCBs contaminated soil from Taizhou city, one of the largest e-waste recycling centers in China. In addition, the enhanced effects of randomly methylated-beta-cyclodextrins (RAMEB) on PCBs phytoremediation potential were evaluated. Higher PCBs removal percentages of 25.6-28.5% in rhizosphere soil were observed after 120 days, compared with those of the non-rhizosphere (10.4-16.9%) and unplanted controls (7.3%). The average PCBs removal percentages of four plant species increased from 26.9% to 37.1% in the rhizosphere soil with addition of RAMEB. Meanwhile, relatively high microbial counts and dehydrogenase activity were detected in planted soils and a stimulatory effect by RAMEB addition was found. The present study indicated that all the plant candidates were feasible for phytoremediation of PCBs contaminated soil from the e-waste recycling area, and tall fescue with RAMEB amendment seemed as a promising remediation strategy. High PCBs removal percentage was due to the increased PCBs bioavailability as well as biostimulation of microbial communities after plantation and RAMEB addition.', 19762136: 'The effects of soil amendments on the phytoextraction of summation operatorDDT (DDT + DDD + DDE) from soil ([ summation operatorDDT] approximately 1500 ng/g) by a pumpkin variety of Cucurbita pepo ssp pepo were tested and the patterns of summation operatorDDT storage throughout the plant shoot were examined. The soil amendments did not increase the total amount of summation operatorDDT extracted into plant shoots, but new information about summation operatorDDT distribution in the plants was obtained. As observed previously, the summation operatorDDT concentration in plant leaves (mean 290 ng/g) was significantly lower than in plant stems (mean 2600 ng/g). Further analysis revealed that summation operatorDDT composition was consistent throughout the plant shoot and that summation operatorDDT concentration in leaves and stems decreased exponentially as distance from the root increased, which was previously unknown. This new information about the patterns of summation operatorDDT uptake and translocation within pumpkin plants highlights the need for appropriate plant sampling strategies in future POPs phytoextraction research.', 19775077: \"The percent removal and uptake of Pb2+ by algal-consortium (CP1) developed from wastewater of biological oxidation pond (Wazirabad, New Delhi, India) was studied under batch conditions with live biomass compared with continuous system using dried biomass immobilized on silica under laboratory conditions. In batch study, algal consortium (CP1) consisting of a mixed culture of Chlorella > Chlamydomonas > Lyngbya sp. was found to remove 17% of Pb2+ after 15 days of incubation from culture media containing 10 mg/L Pb2+, which decreased by increasing metal concentration from 20-50 mg/L. This reduction in removal efficiency was co-related with direct toxic effect of Pb2+ on live consortium as indicated by drastic inhibition in growth. A maximum lead uptake capacity (q(max)) of 33.31 mg/g showed good accumulation potential of live consortium. Bioresin derived from the biomass of dried algal consortium immobilized on silica gel and packed in column exhibited 92.5% removal of Pb2+ with inlet Pb2+ concentration of 33.90 mg/L was brought down to minimum 0.375 mg/L of Pb2+ in outlet stream. The plot of outlet concentration to volume exhibited the typical 'S' shape curve with Pb2+ uptake capacity of 15.95 mg/g. Efficient recovery of 86.16% of Pb2+ was achieved by elution with dilute HCl which indicated multiple usability of immobilized biomass.\", 19799291: 'The redox reactive and electron shuttling function of dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from sewage sludge were studied with Shewanella cinica D14(T) as driving force of electron transfer. The results indicated that sludge DOM initially served as terminal electron acceptor obtaining electrons from the respiratory chain of quinone-reducing bacteria D14(T), then it translated to reduced DOM which can donate electrons to Fe(III) again. The electron donating capacities (EDC) of DOM increased from initial capacity of 2.2-14 micromol x g(-1) to 253-347 micromol x g(-1) after DOM was reduced by D14(T). The cyclic voltammetry measurements and multiple reduction-oxidation cycles experiments of DOM showed that two pairs of redox peaks were clearly observed and the EDC remained at a level of 150-250 micromol x g(-1) after three reduction-oxidation cycles, indicating that DOM can be recyclably used for electron transfer. In the system of hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) reduction by S. cinica D14(T), the reductive dissolution speed was improved with the presence of DOM, since that DOM was capable of acting as an electron shuttle between S. cinica D14(T) and HFO. These results demonstrate the important role of DOM in electron transfer process, and bring out a new perspective about the functions of DOM in the environment.', 19827495: 'This study compares the effects of different metal concentration on survival, reproduction and total metal accumulation by two different earthworm species, Allolobophora parva and Eisenia fetida. The substrate was spiked with different heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Pb, Zn & Cd) with concentrations varying from 500-2500 mg/kg. Cu resulted in complete mortality at all doses for both species. The accumulation of heavy metals for Eisenia fetida in 45 days was in order of Cr>Cd>Pb>Zn where as for Allolobophora parva was Cd>Cr>Pb>Zn. Allolobophora parva accumulated significantly higher concentrations of heavy metals was found in Allolobophora parva as compared to Eisenia fetida. The percentage uptake for Cr and Pb ranged from 65-26% and 39-16% for Eisenia fetida while it was 83-30% and 70-24% for Allolobophora parva at 500-2500 mg/kg. Zn uptake was similar for both species. In case of Cd, uptake percentage for Eisenia fetida at 500 and 1000 mg/kg for local species it was 73% and 52%. Zn produced at 100% mortality at both 1500 and 2500 mg/kg, Cd produced was 43% and 44%, whereas 100% mortality at the highest concentration studied (2500 mg/kg). A mortality of 56-64% was observed at a concentration of 500-2500 mg/kg concentration of Cr while 57-68% mortality was found at 500-2500 mg/kg concentration of Pb. Cd had the greatest detrimental effect on cocoon production by Eisenia fetida and Allolobophora parva. Overall, it is concluded that local earthworm species especially the native species Allolobophora parva have tremendous potential to take up heavy metals from contaminated media/soils.', 19833487: 'Gum kondagogu (Cochlospermum gossypium), a naturally occurring tree biopolymer, is exploited as a biosorbent to remove metal ions from aqueous solutions. The removal efficiency of toxic metals by gum kondagogu was determined quantitatively in the order Cd2+ > Cu2+ > Fe2+ > Se2+ > Pb2+ > total Cr > Ni2+ > Zn2+ > Co2+ > As2+ at pH 5.0+/-0.1 and temperature 25+/-2 degrees C by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The biosorption (%) of various metal ions tested was found to be in the range of 97.3-16.7%, at pH 5.0. The morphological and mechanisms of interaction of toxic metal ions with gum kondagogu were assessed by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (SEM-EDXA) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum. The analysis indicated that biosorption process included morphological changes, precipitation, complexation and ion exchange mechanism for the removal of metal ions by the gum. XRD analysis indicated the amorphous nature of gum kondagogu, which facilitate metal biosorption. The metal ions adsorption leads to its deposition on the gum kondagogu matrix in a crystalline state.', 19838810: \"A chitosanase and a protease were purified from the culture supernatant of Serratia sp. TKU016 with shrimp shell as the sole carbon/nitrogen source. The molecular masses of the chitosanase and protease determined by SDS-PAGE were approximately 65 and 53 kDa, respectively. The chitosanase was inhibited completely by Mn2+, but the protease was enhanced by all of tested divalent metals. The optimum pH, optimum temperature, pH stability, and thermal stability of the chitosanase and protease were (pH 7, 50 degrees C, pH 6-7, <50 degrees C) and (pH 8-10, 40 degrees C, pH 5-10, <50 degrees C), respectively. SDS (2 mM) had stimulatory effect on TKU016 protease activity. The result demonstrates that TKU016 protease is SDS-resistant protease and probably has a rigid structure. Besides, TKU016 culture supernatant (2% SPP) incubated for 2 days has the highest antioxidant activity, the DPPH scavenging ability was about 76%. With this method, we have shown that shrimp shell wastes can be utilized and it's effective in the production of enzymes, antioxidants, peptide and reducing sugar, facilitating its potential use in biological applications and functional foods.\", 19844057: 'The microbial community associated with enhanced biological phosphorus removal with glucose as the main carbon source at 11 degrees C was investigated using microscopy and molecular fingerprinting techniques. The study lasted 77 days and comprised two stages-Stage 1 when the mixture of glucose, yeast and dried milk was the organic carbon source and Stage 2 when glucose was the single carbon source. Rhodocyclus-related polyphosphate accumulating organisms, alpha-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes constituted 42% in Stage 1 and 45% in Stage 2, 21% in Stage 1 and 16% in Stage 2, and 10% in Stage 1 and 7% in Stage 2 of the total bacteria, respectively. The Trichococcus genus from the low GC Gram-positive bacteria was possibly responsible for lactic acid production from glucose. The microbial community was gradually changing throughout the experiment and appeared to stabilize towards the end of the experiment. Periods of suboptimal phosphorus removal could have been caused by competition among different microbial communities for carbon substrate.', 19882357: 'The objective of this study was the application of the experimental design technique to optimize the conditions for the bioremediation of contaminated soil by means of composting. A low-cost material such as compost from the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste as amendment and pyrene as model pollutant were used. The effect of three factors was considered: pollutant concentration (0.1-2 g/kg), soil:compost mixing ratio (1:0.5-1:2 w/w) and compost stability measured as respiration index (0.78, 2.69 and 4.52 mg O2 g(-1) Organic Matter h(-1)). Stable compost permitted to achieve an almost complete degradation of pyrene in a short time (10 days). Results indicated that compost stability is a key parameter to optimize PAHs biodegradation. A factor analysis indicated that the optimal conditions for bioremediation after 10, 20 and 30 days of process were (1.4, 0.78, 1:1.4), (1.4, 2.18. 1:1.3) and (1.3, 2.18, 1:1.3) for concentration (g/kg), compost stability (mg O2 g(-1) Organic Matter h(-1)) and soil:compost mixing ratio, respectively.', 19906398: 'More stringent legislation on dissolved organic matter (DOM) urges the drinking water industry to improve in DOM removal, especially when applied to water with high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents and low turbidity. To improve conventional processes currently used in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs), the performances of a hybrid membrane bioreactor containing fluidized activated carbon were investigated at the DWTP of Rennes. Preliminary results showed that the residual DOC was the major part of the non-biodegradable fraction. In order to increase the global efficiency, an upstream oxidation step was added to the process. Ozone was chosen to break large molecules and increase their biodegradability. The first step consisted of carrying out lab-scale experiments in order to optimise the necessary ozone dose by measuring the process yield, in terms of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). Secondly, activated carbon adsorption of the DOC present in ozonated water was quantified. The whole process was tested in a pilot unit under field conditions at the DWTP of Rennes (France). Lab-scale experiments confirmed that ozonation increases the BDOC fraction, reduces the aromaticity of the DOC and produces small size organic compounds. Adsorption tests led to the conclusion that activated carbon unexpectedly removes BDOC first. Finally, the pilot unit results revealed an additional BDOC removal (from 0.10 to 0.15 mg L(-1)) of dissolved organic carbon from the raw water considered.', 19941033: '5-Hydroxyisophthalic acid-producing microorganisms were isolated from enrichment cultures using 5-sulfoisophthalic acid as a sulfur source. One bacterium, Ochrobactrum anthropi S9, had the highest 5-sulfoisophthalic acid-degrading activity, and stoichiometrically formed 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid, a raw material for polymer synthesis. Under optimum culture conditions, 1.3 mM 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid accumulated in the medium by 60 h. The addition of Na(2)SO(4), L: -methionine or L: -cysteine at 2 mM inhibited the conversion of 5-sulfoisophthalic acid. O. anthropi S9 cells converted 5-sulfoisophthalic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 3-sulfobenzoic acid, 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, naphthalene-1-sulfonic acid and naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid into the corresponding hydroxylated compounds.', 19999997: 'Constructed wetlands have emerged as a viable option for helping to solve a wide range of water quality problems. However, heavy metals adsorbed by substrates would decrease the growth of plants, impair the functions of wetlands and eventually result in a failure of contaminant removal. Typha latifolia L., tolerant to heavy metals, has been widely used for phytoremediation of Pb/Zn mine tailings under waterlogged conditions. This study examined effects of iron as ferrous sulfate (100 and 500 mg/kg) and lead as lead nitrate (0, 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg) on phosphorus utilization and microbial community structure in a constructed wetland. Wetland plants (T. latifolia) were grown for 8 weeks in rhizobags filled with a paddy soil under waterlogged conditions. The results showed that both the amount of iron plaque on the roots and phosphorus adsorbed on the plaque decreased with the amount of lead addition. When the ratio of added iron to lead was 1:1, phosphorus utilized by plants was the maximum. Total amount of phospholipids fatty acids (PLFAs) was 23%-59% higher in the rhizosphere soil than in bulk soil. The relative abundance of Gram-negative bacteria, aerobic bacteria, and methane oxidizing bacteria was also higher in the rhizosphere soil than in bulk soil, but opposite was observed for other bacteria and fungi. Based on cluster analysis, microbial communities were mostly controlled by the addition of ferrous sulfate and lead nitrate in rhizosphere and bulk soil, respectively.', 19999999: 'The growth of high biomass crops facilitated by optimal of agronomic practices has been considered as an alternative to phytoremediation of soils contaminated by heavy metals. A field trial was carried out to evaluate the phytoextraction efficiency of heavy metals by three varieties of sweet sorghum (Sorghum biocolor L.), a high biomass energy plant. Ethylene diamine tetraacetate (EDTA), ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) and ammonium sulphate ((NH4)2SO4) were tested for their abilities to enhance the removal of heavy metals Pb, Cd, Zn, and Cu by sweet sorghum from a contaminated agricultural soil. Sorghum plants always achieved the greatest removal of Pb by leaves and the greatest removal of Cd, Zn and Cu by stems. There was no significant difference among the Keller, Rio and Mray varieties of sweet sorghums in accumulating heavy metals. EDTA treatment was more efficient than ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate in promoting Pb accumulation in sweet sorghum from the contaminated agricultural soil. The application of ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate increased the accumulation of both Zn and Cd in roots of sorghum plants. Results from this study suggest that cropping of sorghum plants facilitated by agronomic practices may be a sustainable technique for partial decontamination of heavy metal contaminated soils.', 20004093: 'The white-rot fungus Trametes vesicolor degraded naproxen (10 mg L(-1)) in a liquid medium to non-detectable levels after 6h. When naproxen was added in the range of concentrations typically found in the environment (55 microg L(-1)), it was almost completely degraded (95%) after 5h. In vitro degradation experiments with purified laccase and purified laccase plus mediator 1-hydroxybenzotriazol showed slight and almost complete naproxen degradation, respectively. A noticeable inhibition on naproxen degradation was also observed when the cytochrome P450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole was added to the fungal cultures. These data suggest that both enzymatic systems could play a role in naproxen degradation. 2-(6-hydroxynaphthalen-2-yl)propanoic acid and 1-(6-methoxynaphthalen-2-yl)ethanone were structurally elucidated by HPLC-DAD-MS and NMR as degradation intermediates of naproxen.

The optimal pH and bicarbonate concentration were firstly obtained using a design of experiment (DOE) methodology. For this purpose a total of 11 experiments were carried out. Sodium bicarbonate concentrations ranging of 20-2000 mg/L and pH values from 6.5 to 8.5 were used in the optimization runs. It was found that the pH has a more pronounced effect on the denitrification process as compared to the bicarbonate dose. The developed quadratic model predicted the optimum conditions at pH 8 and 1100 mg NaHCO(3)/L. Using these optimal conditions, the kinetics of denitrification for nitrate and nitrite degradation were investigated in separate experiments. Both processes were found to follow a zero order kinetic model. The ultimate specific degradation rates for nitrate and nitrite remediation were 29.60 mg NO(3)(-)-N/g MLVSS/L and 34.85 mg NO(3)(-)-N/g MLVSS/L respectively, when hydrogen was supplied every 0.5h.', 20015643: 'The decolorization and detoxification of textile dyes by fungal laccase immobilized on porous glass beads were evaluated. Anthraquinone (Reactive blue 19 and Dispersed blue 3) and indigoid (Acid blue 74) dyes were degraded more rapidly than the azo dyes (Acid red 27 and Reactive black 5). There was no dye sorption to the enzyme bed when decolorization rates were high (>12 microM dye/U-h) but at moderate rates (8 to>0.06 microM/U-h), there was a transient color which disappeared upon prolonged exposure. With Reactive black 5, permanent adsorption occurred most likely because laccase had been totally inactivated. Although laccase treatment was more efficient at decolorizing the anthraquinone dyes, their toxicity (as determined by the Microtox assay) increased while the less efficiently decolorized solutions of azo and indigoid dyes became less toxic. These results demonstrate the potential and limitations of using immobilized laccase to enzymatically decolorize a range of different dye classes and reduce dye toxicity in a single step.', 20018508: 'The ability of a laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) produced by Streptomyces cyaneus CECT 3335 to decolourise and detoxify azo dyes was assessed. Results showed that a colour loss of 90% was achieved only in the presence of acetosyringone (0.1mM) acting as a redox mediator for the laccase. Toxicological analysis of the decolourised dyes revealed that there was no direct correlation between decolouration and detoxification; in fact, in the case of the dyes Methyl Orange and Orange II, a significant increase in toxicity was produced after the treatment. In contrast, a significant decrease in toxicity was observed after the decolouration of New Coccine and Chromotrope 2R. Finally, HPLC analysis of the dyes after treatment revealed the complete disappearance of both dyes and mediator and a concomitant appearance of new chromatographic peaks which could be responsible of the residual toxicity detected in some cases.', 20022490: 'The objective of the work was to investigate tolerance to and removal of arsenic by a facultative marine fungus Aspergillus candidus. The fungus showed luxuriant growth in different concentrations (25 and 50mg/L) of trivalent and pentavalent forms of arsenic. Biomass accumulation data substantiate tolerance of A. candidus towards the test concentrations of trivalent and pentavalent forms of arsenic. Highest arsenic removal (mg/g) was recorded on day 3. As removal increased with an increase in concentration. Hence, the test fungus A. candidus is a promising candidate for arsenic remediation.', 20031399: 'The degradation of textile effluent using microorganisms has been studied extensively, but disposal of generated biomass after dye degradation is a serious problem.

The organism decolorized DR5B at 500mgl(-1) concentration within 24h of dye addition and gave optimum production of PHD. The medium contains carbon source as a molasses which was found to be more significant within all carbon sources used. The Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR), Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) characterization of polyhydroxyalkanoates obtained revealed the compound as a polyhydroxyhexadecanoic acid. The activity of PHA synthase was found more at 24h after dye addition. The enzymes responsible for dye degradation include veratrol oxidase, laccase, DCIP (2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol) reductase, riboflavin reductase and azo reductase was found to be induced during decolorization process.

For nitrate-ASO process, the maximum influent nitrogen concentration was lower than that in nitrite-ASO process, but the maximum influent sulfur concentration was higher than that of nitrite-ASO process. The half saturation values for nitrogen and sulfur in both processes were similar. The minimum reaction time taken for nitrite and sulfide was relatively shorter than in nitrite-ASO reactor. As indicated by sensitivity ratio, activated sludge was more tolerant to sulfide, which had no significant differences between two processes; while it was relatively more sensitive to nitrite over nitrate. PCR-DGGE fingerprints, Dice and Shannon similarity indices and sequencing results all suggested that the microbial communities in both reactors were similar.

Methyl esterification of erucic acid and C22-enriched rapeseed oil generated mainly acidic sophorolipids with different degrees of saturation in the fatty acid chain, which was demonstrated by structural analysis using HPLC, LC-MS and NMR spectroscopy. Regardless of methyl esterification, the rapeseed oil served as the best substrate for high production of sophorolipids among the tested. Methyl esterification also had no noticeable effect on the interfacial properties of sophorolipids. However, 22 carbons introduced in the fatty acid chain increased the hydrophobicity of sophorolipids, and therefore improved surface-active properties and biodegradability.', 20056417: 'The effect of different carbon sources on the starting-up duration of sulfidogenic bioreactor and corresponding bacterial communities were investigated. The bioreactor starting-up duration was closely dependent on the complexity and availability of the carbon sources. 16S rRNA gene diversity of climax bacterial communities developed in each bioreactor had an increasing tendency for the carbon resource of lactate, acetate/ethanol, glucose and molasses. At the steady stage of bioreactors, the molasses-fed bacterial community pattern grouped with that of glucose-fed and acetate/ethanol-fed grouped with that of lactate-fed, both of which separated each other and departed further from the seed sludge. The present study concludes that utilization of simple carbon sources that are readily utilized by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) can not only increase the fraction of SRB and thus improve sulfate removal efficiency, but also shorten the starting-up duration.', 20056513: 'This paper reports fabrication, optimization and characterization of multifunctional biocapsules with immobilized enzyme using a layer-by-layer configuration and their application for removal of phenol and bisphenol A (BPA). The method is based on the combined use of enzymatic oxidation of the BPA and subsequent binding of the reaction product onto a chitosan core biopolymer. This platform has multiple functions including: (1) enzymatic degradation of BPA, (2) adsorption of the degraded compound within the core material, (3) colorimetric quantification and (4) magnetic capabilities. We examined various configurations of core/shell structures of alginate and chitosan and determined the stability and the optimum conditions in which these structures provide the most effective removal capacity. The amount of BPA that can be removed per capsule is 5.6 ppm while phenol can be removed up to 10 ppm per capsule within 15 h.', 20071164: 'Wastewater is often co-contaminated with chromium, chelating agents, and chloride. Influences of Cr(3+) speciation on Cr phytoremediation by Ipomonea aquatica were investigated. MINEQL+ was employed to estimate Cr speciation. Statistic regression was used to investigate the relationships between Cr speciation and accumulation. I. aquatica accumulated high Cr concentration (13,217 mg kg(-1)) in the root at Cr(3+) of 10 mg l(-1) and EDTA of 10(-4) M after 14 d growth. Pearson correlation analysis indicates that root Cr concentration significantly correlated with Cr-EDTA speciation (r = 0.67, p < 0.05) and Cr-Cl speciation (r = 0.91, p < 0.01). Shoot Cr concentration also significantly correlated with Cr-Cl speciation (r = 0.97, p < 0.01). An increase in Cl(-) concentration to 1.72 x 10(-4) M enhanced root Cr concentration; however, the accumulation of root Cr was inhibited at high Cl(-) concentration (5.76 x 10(-5) M). Microscopic image showed that a high portion of Cr(3+) accumulated on the root surface.', 20074942: 'The effects of short-term organic shock loads on the performance of a laboratory scale two-stage activated sludge (AS)-biofilm reactor working at 6 h HRT and treating medium strength domestic wastewater was studied by increasing the influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) to 2-4 times the normal values. Each shock load was applied for a period of 6 h, after which normal loading conditions were resumed. The maximum effluent COD concentration obtained was 169, 169, 250 and 617 mg/L under the shock loads of 808, 1170, 1358 and 1900 mg COD/L, respectively. The COD removal rate increased with increasing effective OLR. The system recovered quickly from shock loads; recovery time proportional to the magnitude of shock loads. The optimum loading rate of the reactor was found at effective OLR of 170 mg COD/m(3)/h. Shock loads changed the dominant bacterial type in the reactor from Gram-positive rods to Gram-negative oval shaped bacteria.', 20092890: 'Our research is focused on the design of hydrogel biomaterials that can be used for 3-D cell encapsulation and tissue engineering. In this study, our goal was to engineer a temperature-responsive biomaterial to possess bioactive properties using polymer and protein chemistry, and at the same time provide the biomaterial with susceptibility to cell-mediated remodeling. Toward this goal, we developed a biomimetic material that can harness the bioactive properties of fibrinogen and the unique structural properties of PluronicF127. PluronicF127 is a synthetic block copolymer that exhibits reverse thermal gelation (RTG) in response to small changes in ambient temperature. We conjugated fibrinogen to Pluronic)F127 to create a biosynthetic precursor with tunable physicochemical properties based on the relationship between the two constituents. A hydrogel matrix was formed from the fibrinogen-F127 adducts by free-radical polymerization using light activation (photo-polymerization). These materials displayed a reversible temperature-induced physical sol-gel transition and an irreversible light-activated chemical cross-linking. The susceptibility of this hydrogel biomaterial to protease degradation and consequent cell-mediated remodeling was controlled by the PluronicF127 constituent. The protein-based material also conveyed inductive signals to cells through bioactive sites on the fibrinogen backbone, as well as through structural properties such as the matrix modulus. We apply these materials as a tissue engineering hydrogel scaffold for 3-D in vitro culture of dermal fibroblasts in order to gain a better understanding of how the material bioactivity and matrix properties can independently affect cell morphology and remodeling.', 20127144: \"The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs diclofenac (DCF) and mefenamic acid (MFA) were treated with the white rot fungus Phanerochaete sordida YK-624. DCF completely disappeared and MFA decreased by about 90% after 6 days of treatment. It was also confirmed that the fungus almost completely removed the acute lethal toxicity of DCF and MFA towards the freshwater crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus after 6 days of treatment. Mass spectrometric and (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance analyses demonstrated that two mono-hydroxylated DCFs (4'-hydroxydiclofenac and 5-hydroxydiclofenac) and one di-hydroxylated DCF (4',5-dihydroxydiclofenac) were formed via fungal transformation. The four metabolites of MFA were identified as 3'-hydroxymethylmefenamic acid (mono-hydroxylated MFA), 3'-hydroxymethyl-5-hydroxymefenamic acid (di-hydroxylated MFA), 3'-hydroxymethyl-6'-hydroxymefenamic acid (di-hydroxylated MFA) and 3'-carboxymefenamic acid. These results suggest that hydroxylation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) in P. sordida YK-624 may be involved in the elimination and detoxification of DCF and MFA. This notion was further supported by the fact that smaller decreases in DCF and MFA were observed in cultures of P. sordida YK-624 incubated with 1-aminobenzotriazole, a known inhibitor of CYP.\", 20129094: 'Acinetobacter sp. strain DR1 is capable of growth on diesel oil. Interestingly, the degradation of diesel oil by the strain DR1 is enhanced in the presence of sodium chloride (NaCl). However, the growth rate of strain DR1 is not affected by the presence of NaCl. Northern blot analysis has also demonstrated that the effect of NaCl on the degradation of diesel oil is not attributable to increased levels of alkane hydroxylase (AlkM-type) gene expression. Rather, we have noted an increase in the exopolysaccharide (EPS) yields of strain DR1 under high NaCl conditions (9-fold). The lag-time of diesel oil biodegradation was significantly shorter in the strain DR1 with exogenous EPS than in the controls, although EPS alone does not support the growth of strain DR1. The recovery of strain DR1 when exposed to diesel oil was accelerated when exogenous EPS was added to the medium. The overproduction of EPS was also noted in the presence of diesel oil and n-hexadecane. The data indicated that EPS overproduction might play a protective role against diesel oil toxicity. Along with the results of the soil microcosm tests, the data presented herein demonstrated that NaCl-induced EPS is associated with a reduction in diesel oil toxicity, and thus increases diesel oil biodegradation in Acinetobacter sp. strain DR1.', 20149964: 'With an increasing focus on phyto-remediation options for landfill leachate, it is important to understand the responses of plant systems to landfill leachate stress. It is especially important to study the tolerant mechanisms of plant systems. We investigated several physiological changes of Zea mays L. (maize) in response to landfill leachate. Specifically, we investigated growth, chlorophyll content, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and activities of antioxidant enzymes. The results indicate that landfill leachate affected the growth and chlorophyll level of maize seedlings. Furthermore, landfill leachate elevated the levels of lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation in leaf tissues in a time-dependent manner, accompanied by the changes in antioxidant status. The physiological responses varied as a function of leachate concentration, and the growth inhibition, chlorophyll content inhibition and oxidative stress occurred after the exposure of higher concentrations of leachate. Higher concentrations of landfill leachate contained higher levels of pollutants. Our results indicate that landfill leachate affected the metabolic responses of plant systems. The risk of pollution occurred mainly in samples of higher concentration. Therefore, the critical aspect of phyto-remediation for landfill leachate is controlling its concentration. In doing so, plant systems may be able to tolerate the environmental stress of landfill leachate.', 20153634: 'The effect of a sulfate reducing bacteria immobilized in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on simultaneous sulfate reduction and copper removal was investigated. Batch experiments were designed using central composite design (CCD) with two parameters, i.e. the copper concentration (10-100mg/L), and the quantity of immobilized SRB in culture solution (19-235 mg of VSS/L). Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to model the experimental data, and to identify optimal conditions for the maximum sulfate reduction and copper removal. Under optimum condition, i.e. approximately 138.5mg VSS/L of sulfate reducing bacteria immobilized in PVA, and approximately 51.5mg/L of copper, the maximum sulfate reduction rate was 1.57 d(-1) as based on the first-order kinetic equation. The data demonstrate that immobilizing sulfate reducing bacteria in PVA can enhance copper removal and the resistance of the bacteria towards copper toxicity.', 20153961: 'The effect of amino acids, complex nitrogen sources and vitamin addition on Trametes trogii, Trametes villosa and Coriolus versicolor var. antarcticus ligninolytic enzyme production, was evaluated. Dye decolorization by their culture filtrates was compared. Glutamic acid followed by peptone, were the best N sources for laccase and manganese peroxidase production. The three fungi produced two laccase isoenzymes (molecular weights from 38 up to 150 kDa); their pattern of production was not affected by medium composition. Although the response was not uniform, vitamin addition sometimes stimulated ligninolytic enzyme production, but never inhibited it. Thiamine induced manganese peroxidase production. T. trogii grown in glutamic acid produced culture filtrates with the highest laccase (188.3 U/ml) and manganese peroxidase activities (4.5 U/ml), rendering the best results in decolorization. These crude filtrates were able to decolorize in half hour (at pH 4.5, 30 degrees C): 13%, 23%, 40%, 46%, 82%, 94% and 95% of Gentian Violet, Xylidine, Congo Red, Malachite Green, Remazol Brilliant Blue R, Indigo Carmine and Anthraquinone Blue, respectively.', 20156640: 'Aquatic plants take up, transform and sequester organic contaminants and may therefore be used in phytoremediation for the removal of pollutants from wastewaters. A better understanding of factors affecting the rate of contaminant uptake by aquatic plants is needed to improve engineered systems for removal of pollutants from wastewaters. This work focused on the influence of initial concentrations of pesticide and population density of plants on toxicity and uptake of the fungicide dimethomorph by two duckweed species. An increased sensitivity to dimethomorph was observed with increasing duckweed population density. Less light, due to crowding, may explain this higher sensitivity and reduced removal rate. A positive relationship was also found between toxicity or contaminant uptake and initial pesticide concentration with a maximal removal of 41 and 26 microg g(-1) fresh weight of dimethomorph (at 600 microg L(-1) of dimethomorph and an initial density of 0.10g E-flask(-1)) by Lemna minor and Spirodela polyrhiza, respectively. This research also indicated that these aquatic plants can efficiently eliminate organic contaminants and may ultimately serve as phytoremediation agents in the natural environment.', 20156677: 'A multi-step response surface methodology was successfully applied to optimize the biosorption conditions for the maximum removal of Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions using Trametes versicolor fungi as a biosorbent. In the first step, the most effective medium factors, which are pH, temperature and initial Cu(II) concentration, on biosorption of Cu(II), were determined through Plackett-Burman Design. Then steepest accent followed by central composite design steps were utilized to evaluate the optimum biosorption conditions for the maximum Cu(II) ions removal. Based on the statistic analysis; the optimum conditions were obtained 5.51, 20.13 degrees C and 60.98 mg/L as medium pH, medium temperature and initial Cu(II) concentration, respectively. Finally the analysis of variance (ANOVA) of central composite design showed the proposed quadratic model fitted experimental data very well.', 20156678: 'Agricultural crop wastes are typically lignocellulosic in composition and thus partially recalcitrant to enzymatic degradation. The recalcitrant nature of plant biomass and the inability to obtain complete enzymatic hydrolysis has led to the establishment of various pre-treatment strategies. Alkaline pre-treatments increase the accessibility of the exposed surface to enzymatic hydrolysis through the removal of acetyl and uronic acid substituents on hemicelluloses. Unlike the use of steam and acid pre-treatments, alkaline pre-treatments (e.g. lime) solubilise lignin and a small percentage of the hemicelluloses. The most common alkaline pre-treatments that are employed make use of sodium hydroxide and lime. This study compared the synergistic degradation of un-treated and lime pre-treated sugarcane bagasse using cellulosomal and non-cellulosomal hemicellulases as free enzymes. The enzyme combination of 37.5% ArfA and 62.5% ManA produced the highest amount of reducing sugar of 91.834 micromol/min for the degradation of un-treated bagasse. This enzyme combination produced a degree of synergy of 1.87. The free enzymes displayed an approximately 6-fold increase in the enzyme activity, i.e. the total amount of reducing sugar released (593.65 micromol/min) with the enzyme combination of 37.5% ArfA, 25% ManA and 37.5% XynA for the lime pre-treated substrate and a degree of synergy of 2.14. To conclude, this study indicated that pre-treating the sugarcane bagasse is essential, in order to increase the efficiency of lignocellulose enzymatic hydrolysis by disruption of the lignin sheath, that the lime pre-treatment did not have any dramatic effect on the synergistic relationship between the free enzymes, and that time may play an important role in the establishment of synergistic relationships between enzymes.', 20156685: 'The ability of Emericella nidulans var. lata, Neurospora intermedia and Bacillus sp. to treat distillery spent wash in a three stage bioreactor was investigated. Process parameters were optimized in shake flask cultures with the individual strains before treatment of the effluent in a 15-l bioreactor. Treatment was first carried out by the fungi followed by bacteria. The treated effluent showed significant reduction in color (82%) and COD (93%) after 30 h. Metabolites formed after degradation of complex polymers in distillery effluent were assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy and included furan, simple acid types and organic compounds. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16S rDNA and 18S rDNA sequences amplified from DNA isolated from the reactor communities indicated the presence of other organisms besides those introduced initially. The microbial communities were able to carry out bioremediation of distillery effluent and produce discharge that conforms to safety standards.', 20176940: 'Plant litter decomposition is a critical step in the formation of soil organic matter, the mineralization of organic nutrients, and the carbon balance in terrestrial ecosystems. Biotic decomposition in mesic ecosystems is generally negatively correlated with the concentration of lignin, a group of complex aromatic polymers present in plant cell walls that is recalcitrant to enzymatic degradation and serves as a structural barrier impeding microbial access to labile carbon compounds. Although photochemical mineralization of carbon has recently been shown to be important in semiarid ecosystems, litter chemistry controls on photodegradative losses are not understood. We evaluated the importance of litter chemistry on photodegradation of grass litter and cellulose substrates with varying levels of lignin [cellulose-lignin (CL) substrates] under field conditions. Using wavelength-specific light attenuation filters, we found that light-driven mass loss was promoted by both UV and visible radiation. The spectral dependence of photodegradation correlated with the absorption spectrum of lignin but not of cellulose. Field incubations demonstrated that increasing lignin concentration reduced biotic decomposition, as expected, but linearly increased photodegradation. In addition, lignin content in CL substrates consistently decreased in photodegradative incubations. We conclude that lignin has a dual role affecting litter decomposition, depending on the dominant driver (biotic or abiotic) controlling carbon turnover. Under photodegradative conditions, lignin is preferentially degraded because it acts as an effective light-absorbing compound over a wide range of wavelengths. This mechanistic understanding of the role of lignin in plant litter decomposition will allow for more accurate predictions of carbon dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems.', 20185158: 'Application of low doses of alum to treatment wetlands to reduce elevated outflow winter phosphorus concentrations were tested in mesocosms vegetated with either Typhadomingensis, Schoenoplectus californicus, or submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) (Najas guadalupensis-dominated). Alum was pumped to experimental units at a rate of 0.91 g Al m(-2) d(-1) and water quality monitored for 3 months. The alum application significantly improved the outflow water quality and overall the growth of the plants was unaffected by the alum application. Biomass and growth varied between species and through time, but no significant effects of alum application were detected. The concentrations of nutrients and mineral elements in the aboveground tissues differed between species and over time, but only the concentration of Al in plant tissue was increased by alum additions. The concentration of Al was 50-fold higher in alum-treated SAV as compared to the control, and in Typha and Schoenoplectus the concentrations were 4- and 2-fold, higher, respectively. The N/P ratios in the plant tissues were low (<10) suggesting that their growth and biomass was limited by nitrogen. The research suggests that a continuous or seasonal low-dosage alum application to treatment wetlands provides an effective tool to maintain discharge concentrations within permitted values during the inefficient winter treatment times. We suggest that the use of alum should be restricted to treatment wetland areas dominated by emergent vegetation as the effects of the elevated Al concentrations in SAV needs further study.', 20188540: 'A microbial fuel cell and anaerobic-aerobic sequential reactor coupled system was used for azo dye degradation with simultaneous electricity production. Electricity was produced during the co-metabolism process of glucose and azo dye. A microorganism cultured graphite-granular cathode effectively decreased the charge transfer resistance of the cathode and yielded higher power density. Operation parameters including glucose concentration and hydraulic retention time were optimized. The results indicated that recovering electricity during a sequential aerobic-anaerobic azo dye treatment process enhanced chemical oxygen demand removal and did not decrease azo dye removal. Moreover, UV-vis spectra and GC-MS illustrated that the azo bond was cleaved biologically in the anaerobic chamber and abiotically in the aerobic chamber. The toxic intermediates, aromatic amines, were removed by aerobic treatment. Our work demonstrated that the microbial fuel cell and sequential anode-cathode reactor coupled system could be applied to achieve electricity production with simultaneous azo dye degradation.', 20204468: 'The soil actinobacteria Rhodococcus rhodochrous PA-34, Rhodococcus sp. NDB 1165 and Nocardia globerula NHB-2 grown in the presence of isobutyronitrile exhibited nitrilase activities towards benzonitrile (approx. 1.1-1.9 U mg(-1) dry cell weight). The resting cell suspensions eliminated benzonitrile and the benzonitrile analogues chloroxynil (3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzonitrile), bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile) and ioxynil (3,5-diiodo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile) (0.5 mM each) from reaction mixtures at 30 degrees C and pH 8.0. The products were isolated and identified as the corresponding substituted benzoic acids. The reaction rates decreased in the order benzonitrile > chloroxynil > bromoxynil > ioxynil in all strains. Depending on the strain, 92-100, 70-90 and 30-51% of chloroxynil, bromoxynil and ioxynil, respectively, was hydrolyzed after 5 h. After a 20-h incubation, almost full conversion of chloroxynil and bromoxynil was observed in all strains, while only about 60% of the added ioxynil was converted into carboxylic acid. The product of ioxynil was not metabolized any further, and those of the other two herbicides very slowly. None of the nitrilase-producing strains hydrolyzed dichlobenil (2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile). 3,5-Dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid exhibited less inhibitory effect than bromoxynil both on luminescent bacteria and germinating seeds of Lactuca sativa. 3,5-Diiodo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid only exhibited lower toxicity than ioxynil in the latter test.', 20206309: 'Rice straw was fermented by a wood-rot fungus Dichomitus squalens as a biological pretreatment, to increase the enzymatic digestibility of lignocellulose and promote cellulose hydrolysis. Response surface methodology was employed to optimize the fermentation medium of D. squalens for achieving the maximum volumetric activity of manganese peroxidase. The fermentation of rice straw by D. squalens for 15 days resulted in the enzymatic digestibility of 58.1% of theoretical glucose yield for the remaining glucan. In addition, a significant reduction in the crystallinity index and microstructural changes in the fermented rice straw were revealed. When the fungal-fermented rice straw was used as a substrate for ethanol production in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, the ethanol production yield and productivity were 54.2% of the theoretical maximum and 0.39 g/L/hour, respectively, after 24 hours.', 20218541: 'Comparing the UV-A photocatalytic treatment of bioaerosols contaminated with different airborne microorganisms such as L. pneumophila bacteria, T2 bacteriophage viruses and B. atrophaeus bacterial spores, pointed out a decontamination sensitivity following the bacteria > virus > bacterial spore ranking order, differing from that obtained for liquid-phase or surface UV-A photocatalytic disinfection. First-principles CFD investigation applied to a model annular photoreactor evidenced that larger the microorganism size, higher the hit probability with the photocatalytic surfaces. Applied to a commercial photocatalytic purifier case-study, the CFD calculations showed that the performances of the studied purifier could strongly benefit from rational reactor design engineering. The results obtained highlighted the required necessity to specifically investigate the removal of airborne microorganisms in terms of reactor design, and not to simply transpose the results obtained from studies performed toward chemical pollutants, especially for a successful commercial implementation of air decontamination photoreactors. This illustrated the importance of the aerodynamics in air decontamination, directly resulting from the microorganism morphology.', 20229281: StringElement('Contamination with petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) is a global problem with environmental implications. Physico-chemical treatments can be used for soil cleanup, but they are expensive, and can have implications for soil structure and environment. Otherwise, biological remediation treatments are cost-effective and restore soil structure. Several remediation experiments have been carried out in the lab and in the field; however, there is the challenge to achieve as good or better results in the field as in the laboratory. In the ambit of a project aiming at investigating suitable biological remediation approaches for recovering a refinery contaminated soil, we present here results obtained in bioremediation trials. The approaches biostimulation and bioaugmentation were tested, in parallel, and compared with natural attenuation. For this purpose, mesocosm experiments were carried out inside the refinery area, which constitutes a real asset of this work.', attributes={'Label': 'PURPOSE', 'NlmCategory': 'OBJECTIVE'}), 20230031: 'We have demonstrated in our earlier work that a few natural and synthetic estrogens can be effectively transformed through reactions mediated by lignin peroxidase (LiP). The behaviors of such reactions are variously influenced by the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) and/or veratryl alcohol (VA). Certain white rot fungi, e.g. Phanerochaete chrysosporium, produce VA as a secondary metabolite along with LiP in nature where NOM is ubiquitously present. Herein, we report a study on the products resulting from LiP-mediated oxidative coupling reactions of a representative estrogen, 17beta-estradiol (E2), and how the presence of NOM and/or VA impacts the formation and distribution of the products. A total of six products were found, and the major products appeared to be oligomers resulting from E2 coupling. Our experiments revealed that these products likely formed colloidal solids in water that can be removed via ultrafiltration or settled during ultracentrifugation. Such a colloidal nature of the products could have important implications in their treatability and environmental transport. In the presence of VA, the products tended to shift toward higher-degree of oligomers. When NOM was included in the reaction system, cross-coupling between E2 and NOM appeared to occur. Data obtained from E-SCREEN test confirmed that the estrogenicity of E2 can be effectively eliminated following sequential reactions mediated by LiP.', 20306326: 'Activated sludge acclimated to biodegrade phenol was allowed to attach on and in light porous ceramic carriers and to function as a biofilm in a photolytic circulating-bed bioreactor (PCBBR). Phenol degradation in the PCBBR was investigated following three protocols: photolysis with ultraviolet light alone (P), biodegradation alone (B), and the two mechanisms operating simultaneously (P/B). Phenol was degraded at approximately equal rates by B and P/B, each of which was much faster than the rate by P. Furthermore, phenol was mineralized to a significantly greater extent with P/B than with either P or B. SEM showed that the biofilm survived well inside macropores that presumably shaded the microorganisms from UV irradiation, even though the UV light greatly reduced biofilm on outer surface of the carriers in the P/B experiments. Rapid biodegradation of phenol, enhanced mineralization, and survival of bacteria inside macropores demonstrated that being in a biofilm inside the porous carriers protected the bacteria from UV-light toxicity, allowing intimate coupling of photolysis and biodegradation.', 20383654: 'The biodegradation of chlorinated organics in vadose zone soils is challenging owing to the presence of oxygen, which inhibits reductive dehalogenation reactions and consequently the growth of dehalorespiring microbes. In addition, the hydraulic conductivity of vadose zone soils is typically high, hence attempts to remediate such zones with biostimulation solutions are often unsuccessful due to the short residence times for these solutions to act upon the native bacterial community. In this study we have identified sodium alginate as a hydrogel polymer that can be used to increase the residence time of a nutrient solution in an unsaturated sandy soil. Additionally we have identified neutral red as a redox active compound that can catalyse the reductive dechlorination of the chlorinated organic hexachloro-1,3-butadiene by activated sludge fed with lactate and acetate. Finally we have shown that a nutrient solution amended with neutral red and sodium alginate can lower the redox potential and reduce hexachloro-1,3-butadiene concentrations in a contaminated vadose zone soil.', 20407917: 'A bacterial consortium (consortium GR) consisting of Proteus vulgaris NCIM-2027 and Micrococcus glutamicus NCIM-2168 could rapidly decolorize and degrade commonly-used sulfonated reactive dye Green HE4BD and many other reactive dyes. Consortium GR shows markedly higher decolorization activity than that of the individual strains. The preferable physicochemical parameters were identified to achieve higher dye degradation and decolorization efficiency. The supplementation of cheap co-substrates (e.g., extracts of agricultural wastes) could enhance the decolorization performance of consortium GR. Extent of mineralization was determined with TOC and COD measurements, showing nearly complete mineralization of Green HE4BD by consortium GR (up to 90% TOC and COD reduction) within 24\\xa0h. Oxidoreductive enzymes seemed to be involved in fast decolorization/degradation process with the evidence of enzymes induction in the bacterial consortium. Phytotoxicity and microbial toxicity studies confirm that the biodegraded products of Green HE4BD by consortium GR are non-toxic. Consortium GR also shows significant biodegradation and decolorization activities for mixture of reactive dyes as well as the effluent from actual dye manufacturing industry. This confers the possibility of applying consortium GR for the treatment of industrial wastewaters containing dye pollutants.', 20427070: 'Bioaugmentation was investigated as a method to decrease the recovery period of anaerobic digesters exposed to a transient toxic event. Two sets of laboratory-scale digesters (SRT = 10 days, OLR = 2 g COD/L-day), started with inoculum from a digester stabilizing synthetic municipal wastewater solids (MW) and synthetic industrial wastewater (WW), respectively, were transiently exposed to the model toxicant, oxygen. Bioaugmented digesters received 1.2 g VSS/L-day of an H2-utilizing culture for which the archaeal community was analyzed. Soon after oxygen exposure, the bioaugmented digesters produced 25-60% more methane than non-bioaugmented controls (p < 0.05). One set of digesters produced lingering high propionate concentrations, and bioaugmentation resulted in significantly shorter recovery periods. The second set of digesters did not display lingering propionate, and bioaugmented digesters recovered at the same time as non-bioaugmented controls. The difference in the effect of bioaugmentation on recovery may be due to differences between microbial communities of the digester inocula originally employed. In conclusion, bioaugmentation with an H(2)-utilizing culture is a potential tool to decrease the recovery period, decrease propionate concentration, and increase biogas production of some anaerobic digesters after a toxic event. Digesters already containing rapidly adaptable microbial communities may not benefit from bioaugmentation, whereas other digesters with poorly adaptable microbial communities may benefit greatly.', 20451949: 'Iron (Fe) nanoparticles are increasingly being employed for the remediation of Chlorinated Aliphatic Hydrocarbon (CAH) contaminated sites. However, these particles have recently been reported to be cytotoxic to bacterial cells, and may therefore have a negative impact on exposed microbial communities. The overall objective of this study was to investigate the impact of Fe nanoparticles on the biodegradation of CAHs by an indigenous dechlorinating bacterial community. Also, to determine the most appropriate combination and/or application of bimetallic (Ni/Fe) nanoparticles and dechlorinating bacteria for the remediation of CAH contaminated sites. Addition of Fe nanoparticles to groundwater collected from a CAH contaminated site in Derby, UK, led to a decrease in the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and an increase in pH. The biological degradation rate of TCE was observed to progressively decrease in the presence of increasing Fe nanoparticle concentrations; which ranged from 0.01 to 0.1 gL(-1), and cease completely at concentrations of 0.3 gL(-1) or above. Concentrations greater than 0.3 gL(-1) led to a decline in viable bacterial counts and the inhibition of biological sulphate reduction. The most appropriate means of combining bimetallic (Ni/Fe) nanoparticles and indigenous dechlorinating bacteria was to employ a two step process: initially stimulating the biodegradation of TCE using acetate, followed by the addition of bimetallic nanoparticles to degrade the remaining cis-1,2-DCE and VC.', 20452106: 'Incubation and pot experiments using poplar (Populus nigra L. cv. Wolterson) were performed in order to evaluate the questionable efficiency of EDDS-enhanced phytoextraction of Cu from contaminated soils. Despite the promising conditions of the experiment (low contamination of soils with a single metal with a high affinity for EDDS, metal tolerant poplar species capable of producing high biomass yields, root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi), the phytoextraction efficiency was not sufficient. The EDDS concentrations used in this study (3 and 6 mmol kg(-1)) enhanced the mobility (up to a 100-fold increase) and plant uptake of Cu (up to a 65-fold increase). However, despite EDDS degradation and the competition of Fe and Al for the chelant, Cu leaching cannot be omitted during the process. Due to the low efficiency, further research should be focused on other environment-friendly methods of soil remediation.', 20454836: 'In this study, we isolated and characterized a novel feather-degrading bacterium that shows keratinolytic, antifungal and plant growth-promoting activities.

In the improved medium containing 0.1% (w/v) feather, keratinolytic protease production was around 53.3\\xa0±\\xa00.3\\xa0U/ml at 4\\xa0day; this value was 10-fold higher than the yield in the basal feather medium (5.3\\xa0±\\xa00.1\\xa0U/ml). After cultivation for 5\\xa0days in the improved medium, intact feather was completely degraded. Feather degradation resulted in free -SH group, soluble protein and amino acids production. The concentration of free -SH group in the culture medium was 15.5\\xa0±\\xa00.2\\xa0μM at 4\\xa0days. Nineteen amino acids including all essential amino acids were produced in the culture medium; the concentration of total amino acid produced was 3360.4\\xa0μM. Proline (2809.9\\xa0μM), histidine (371.3\\xa0μM) and phenylalanine (172.0\\xa0μM) were the major amino acids released in the culture medium. B. subtilis S8 showed the properties related to plant growth promotion: hydrolytic enzymes, ammonification, indoleacetic acid (IAA), phosphate solubilization, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Interestingly, the strain S8 grown in the improved medium produced IAA and antifungal activity, indicating simultaneous production of keratinolytic and antifungal activities and IAA by B. subtilis S8. These results suggest that B. subtilis S8 could be not only used to improve the nutritional value of feather wastes but also is useful in situ biodegradation of feather wastes. Furthermore, it could also be a potential biofertilizer or biocontrol agent applicable to crop plant soil.', 20457514: 'A 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP)-degrading strain, T6, was isolated by continuous enrichment culture and identified as Ralstonia sp. based on morphological, physiological and biochemical tests as well as 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The bacterium metabolized 100 mg/L TCP within 12 h and 700 mg/L TCP in 80 h. A green metabolite, putatively identified as 3,6-dihydroxypyridine-2,5-dione, was detected. This is the first report of TCP-degrading isolate from the genus of Ralstonia. Strain T6 could potentially be employed in bioremediation of TCP.', 20457515: 'This study described the adsorption of chloramphenicol (CAP) in wastewater on the renewable bioresource of bamboo charcoal (BC). Results showed that CAP adsorption on BC (Ln q(e)=1.272 Ln C(e)+1.971) and H(2)SO(4) modified BC (Ln q(e)=1.851 Ln C(e)+0.659) were very slight, and on NaOH modified BC was significantly increased (Ln q(e)=0.344 Ln C(e)+6.490). The adsorbents were characterized by N(2) adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is revealed that BC and modified BC had very small surface areas of less than 1 m(2) g(-1), H(2)SO(4) treatment led to minimal variation in surface functional groups, and NaOH treatment increased the percentage of surface graphitic carbon and other oxygen-containing groups. The increased adsorption of CAP on NaOH modified BC was mainly ascribed to the enhancement of the pi-pi interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate.', 20462625: 'Due to incomplete removal of artificial sweeteners in wastewater treatment plants some of these compounds end up in receiving surface waters, which are used for drinking water production. The sum of removal efficiency of single treatment steps in multi-barrier treatment systems affects the concentrations of these compounds in the provided drinking water. This is the first systematic study revealing the effectiveness of single treatment steps in laboratory experiments and in waterworks. Six full-scale waterworks using surface water influenced raw water were sampled up to ten times to study the fate of acesulfame, saccharin, cyclamate and sucralose. For the most important treatment technologies the results were confirmed by laboratory batch experiments. Saccharin and cyclamate proved to play a minor role for drinking water treatment plants as they were eliminated by nearly 100% in all waterworks with biologically active treatment units like river bank filtration (RBF) or artificial groundwater recharge. Acesulfame and sucralose were not biodegraded during RBF and their suitability as wastewater tracers under aerobic conditions was confirmed. Sucralose proved to be persistent against ozone and its transformation was < 20% in lab and field investigations. Remaining traces were completely removed by subsequent granular activated carbon (GAC) filters. Acesulfame readily reacts with ozone (pseudo first-order rate constant k = 1.3 x 10(-3) s(-1) at 1 mg L(-1) ozone concentration). However, the applied ozone concentrations and contact times under typical waterworks conditions only led to an incomplete removal (18-60%) in the ozonation step. Acesulfame was efficiently removed by subsequent GAC filters with a low throughput of less than 30 m(3) kg(-1), but removal strongly depended on the GAC preload. Thus, acesulfame was detected up to 0.76 microg L(-1) in finished water.', 20471827: 'Biosorption characteristics of a surfactant modified macro fungus were investigated for decolorization of Reactive Red 2 contaminated solutions. Better biosorption efficiency was obtained with a small amount of fungal biomass after modification process. Operating variables like pH, biomass amount, contact time, temperature, dye concentration, flow rate and column size were explored. The biosorption process followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. Thermodynamic data confirm that the biosorption process is spontaneous and endothermic in nature. Under optimized batch conditions, up to 141.53 mg dye g(-1) could be removed from solution in a relatively short time. Modification process was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy and zeta potential studies. Possible dye-biosorbent interactions were discussed. Good dynamic flow biosorption potential was observed for the suggested biosorbent in simulated wastewater. Overall, batch and continuous mode data suggest that this environmentally friendly and efficient biosorbent may be useful for the removal of reactive dyes from aqueous media.', 20472733: 'Sorption to sediment black carbon (BC) may limit the aerobic biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in resuspension events and intact sediment beds. We examined this hypothesis experimentally under conditions that were realistic in terms of oxygen concentrations and BC content. A new method, based on synchronous fluorescence observations of (14)C-pyrene, was developed for continuously measuring the uptake of dissolved pyrene by Mycobacterium gilvum VM552, a representative degrader of PAHs. The effect of oxygen and pyrene concentrations on pyrene uptake followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, resulting in a dissolved oxygen half-saturation constant (K(om)) of 14.1 microM and a dissolved pyrene half-saturation constant (K(pm)) of 6 nM. The fluorescence of (14)C-pyrene in air-saturated suspensions of sediments and induced cells followed time courses that reflected simultaneous desorption and biodegradation of pyrene, ultimately causing a quasi-steady-state concentration of dissolved pyrene balancing desorptive inputs and biodegradation removals. The increasing concentrations of (14)CO(2) in these suspensions, as determined with liquid scintillation, evidenced the strong impact of sorption to BC-rich sediments on the biodegradation rate. Using the best-fit parameter values, we integrated oxygen and sorption effects and showed that oxygen tensions far below saturation levels in water are sufficient to enable significant decreases in the steady-state concentrations of aqueous-phase pyrene. These findings may be relevant for bioaccumulation scenarios that consider the effect of sediment resuspension events on exposure to water column and sediment pore water, as well as the direct uptake of PAHs from sediments.', 20476735: 'Microbial reduction of Fe(III) oxides results in the production of Fe(II) and may lead to the subsequent formation of Fe(II)-bearing secondary mineralization products including magnetite, siderite, vivianite, chukanovite (ferrous hydroxy carbonate (FHC)), and green rust; however, the factors controlling the formation of specific Fe(II) phases are often not well-defined. This study examined effects of (i) a range of inorganic oxyanions (arsenate, borate, molybdate, phosphate, silicate, and tungstate), (ii) natural organic matter (citrate, oxalate, microbial extracellular polymeric substances [EPS], and humic substances), and (iii) the type and number of dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria on the bioreduction of lepidocrocite and formation of Fe(II)-bearing secondary mineralization products. The bioreduction kinetics clustered into two distinct Fe(II) production profiles. \"Fast\" Fe(II) production kinetics [19-24 mM Fe(II) d(-1)] were accompanied by formation of magnetite and FHC in the unamended control and in systems amended with borate, oxalate, gellan EPS, or Pony Lake fulvic acid or having \"low\" cell numbers. Systems amended with arsenate, citrate, molybdate, phosphate, silicate, tungstate, EPS from Shewanella putrefaciens CN32, or humic substances derived from terrestrial plant material or with \"high\" cell numbers exhibited comparatively slow Fe(II) production kinetics [1.8-4.0 mM Fe(II) d(-1)] and the formation of green rust. The results are consistent with a conceptual model whereby competitive sorption of more strongly bound anions blocks access of bacterial cells and reduced electron-shuttling compounds to sites on the iron oxide surface, thereby limiting the rate of bioreduction.', 20486009: 'During reclamation the water associated with the runoff or groundwater flushing from dry stackable tailings technologies may become available to the reclaimed environment within an oil sands lease. Here we evaluate the performance of the emergent macrophyte, common reed (Phragmites australis), grown in chemically amended mature fine tailings (MFT) and simulated runoff/seepage water from different MFT drying treatments. The present study also investigated the phytotoxicity of the concentration of oil sands naphthenic acids (NAs) in different MFT drying chemical treatments, in both planted and unplanted systems. We demonstrate that although growth was reduced, the emergent macrophyte common reed was capable of growing in diluted unamended MFT runoff, as well as in diluted runoff from MFT amended with either 0.25% lime and gypsum or 0.5% gypsum. Common reed can thus assist in the dewatering process of oil sands MFT. However, simulated runoff or seepage waters from chemically amended and dried MFT were phytotoxic, due to combined levels of salts, naphthenic acids and pH. Phytoremediation of runoff water/ground water seepage from dry-land applied MFT will thus require pre-treatment in order to make conditions more favorable for plant growth.', 20494396: 'An innovative process based on ozone-enhanced biological degradation, carried out in an aerobic granular biomass system (SBBGR--Sequencing Batch Biofilter Granular Reactor), was tested at pilot scale for tannery wastewater treatment chosen as representative of industrial recalcitrant wastewater. The results have shown that the process was able to meet the current discharge limits when the biologically treated wastewater was recirculated through an adjacent reactor where a specific ozone dose of 120 mg O3/L(influent) was used. The benefits produced by using ozone were appreciable even visually since the final effluent of the process looked like tap water. In comparison with the conventional treatment, the proposed process was able to reduce the sludge production by 25-30 times and to save 60% of operating costs. Molecular in situ detection methods were employed in combination with the traditional measurements (oxygen uptake rate, total protein content, extracellular polymeric substances and hydrophobicity) to evaluate microbial activity and composition, and the structure of the biomass. A stable presence of active bacterial populations was observed in the biomass with the simultaneous occurrence of distinctive functional microbial groups involved in carbon, nitrogen and sulphate removal under different reaction environments established within the large microbial aggregates. The structure and activity of the biomass were not affected by the use of ozone.', 20496937: 'During two-phase sludge anaerobic digestion, sludge is usually hydrolyzed and acidified in the first phase, then methane is produced in the second stage. To get more methane from sludge, most studies in literature focused on the increase of sludge hydrolysis. In this paper a different sludge pretreatment method, i.e., pretreating sludge at pH 10 for 8 d is reported, by which both waste activated sludge hydrolysis and acidification were increased, and the methane production was significantly improved. First, the effect of different sludge pretreatment methods on methane yield was compared. The pH 10 pretreated sludge showed the highest accumulative methane yield (398 mL per g of volatile suspended solids), which was 4.4-, 3.5-, 3.1-, and 2.3-fold of the blank (unpretreated), ultrasonic, thermal, and thermal-alkaline pretreated sludge, respectively. Nevertheless, its total time involved in the first (hydrolysis and acidification) and second (methanogenesis) stages was 17 (8 + 9) d, which was almost the same as other pretreatments. Then, the mechanisms for pH 10 pretreatment significantly improving methane yield were investigated. It was found that pretreating sludge at pH 10 caused the greatest sludge hydrolysis, acidification, soluble C:N and C:P ratios, and Fe(3+) concentration with a suitable short-chain fatty acids composition in the first stage, which resulted in the highest microorganism activity (ATP) and methane production in the second phase. Further investigation on the second phase microorganisms with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that there were much greater active methanogenesis Archaea when methane was produced with the pH 10 pretreated sludge, and the predominant morphology of the microcolonies suggest a shift to Methanosarcina sp. like.', 20512725: 'This study investigated the aerobic degradation of tetrachlorobisphenol-A (TCBPA) in sediment samples collected at three sites along Erren River in southern Taiwan. TCBPA biodegradation rate constants (k(1)) and half-lives (t(1/2)) ranged from 0.03 to 0.06 day(-1) and 11.6 to 23.1 days, respectively. The biodegradation of TCBPA was enhanced by the addition of cellulose, yeast extract, sodium chloride, brij 30, brij 35, surfactin, and rhamnolipid. Of the micro-organism strains isolated from the sediment, we found that strains L1 and L5 (identified as Bacillus megaterium and Pseudomonas putida) expressed the best biodegrading ability. The inoculation of sediment with the TCBPA-degrading bacteria could enhance the efficiency of degradation.', 20566284: 'This study determined the role of plant and microbes in arsenite (AsIII) oxidation in the growth media and the location of AsIII oxidation and arsenate (AsV) reduction in Pteris vittata tissues. P. vittata grew in 0.10-0.27mM AsV or AsIII solution under aerated or sterile condition for 1h to 14d. Arsenic speciation was conducted in the growth media, biomass (roots, rhizomes, rachis, pinnae, and fronds), and sap (rhizomes and fronds). Arsenite was rapidly oxidized in the growth media by microbes (18-67% AsV after 1d) and was then further oxidized in the roots of P. vittata (35% AsV in the roots growing in AsIII media). While limited reduction occurred in the roots (7-8% as AsIII), AsV reduction mostly occurred in the rhizomes (68-71% as AsIII) and pinnae (>90% as AsIII) of P. vittata. Regardless AsIII or AsV was supplied, AsV dominated in the roots while AsIII dominated in the rhizomes and fronds. AsIII translocation from the roots to the fronds was more rapid than AsV. This study shed new insights into arsenic transformation in the growth media and P. vittata biomass and raise new question into the tissue distribution of arsenic reducing and oxidizing enzymes in P. vittata.', 20566285: 'The objective of this study was to investigate the potential ability of decolorizing Reactive Dark Blue K-R by the synergism of fungal strain Penicillium sp. QQ and bacterial strain Exiguobacterium sp. TL. The optimal conditions for decolorization determined by response surface methodology (RSM) were as follows: 12.5% (w/v) of both strains QQ and TL, 0.19% (w/v) of glucose, 0.09% (w/v) of yeast extract, pH7.0, 37 degrees C and 200mg/L of initial dye concentration. It was shown that about 97% of 200mg/L K-R could be decolorized within 24h under these conditions. Besides, strains QQ and TL co-cultures could decolorize 10 kinds of azo dyes effectively and be still 60% color removal when salinity increased to 15%. And most of the tested metal ions showed little influence on the decolorization except for Ni(2+). The results demonstrated that strains QQ and TL co-cultures could be useful for the practical bioremediation.', 20570314: 'Algogenic organic matter produced by the excess growth of cyanobacteria in semi-closed water areas causes coagulation inhibition in drinking water production. In this study, hydrophilic substances of Microcystis aeruginosa, which were mainly composed of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and RNA, were prepared, and the involvement of these cyanobacterial hydrophilic substances in coagulation inhibition was investigated. As a result, it was found that the negatively charged hydrophilic substances with a molecular weight higher than 10 kDa have a significant role in coagulation inhibition. Further fractionation of cyanobacterial hydrophilic substances revealed that surface-retained organic matter (SOM), including LPS, could exhibit a potent inhibitory effect on the coagulation using polyaluminum chloride (PACl), presumably because of the direct interaction of hydrophilic SOM with cations originated from PACl, which could impede the hydrolysis of the coagulant.', 20576562: 'In this paper the Mannich reaction product of dimethylamine, acetone and formaldehyde was grafted onto hydroxymethylated lignin to form a lignin-base cationic polyelectrolyte (L-DAF). L-DAF samples with different cationic strengths and molecular weights were synthesized and characterized. Their performance as a cationic flocculant in removing three anionic azo-dyes (Acid Black, Reactive Red and Direct Red) from simulated dye wastewater was evaluated. The removal of anionic dyes by L-DAF was ascribed to two simultaneous mechanisms, which included coagulation by charge neutralization and flocculation by bridging. There was a different optimum dose of flocculant for each dye wastewater, at which dye removal can reach above 95%. Furthermore, a longer settling time and a lower solution pH increased the efficiency of the decolorization process. During the treatment, more than 89% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction was achieved with sludge production being less than 5.4%.', 20584598: 'The reduction of Cr(VI) by resting Escherichia coli cells was significantly enhanced by the quinone redox mediators, lawsone, menadione, anthraquinone-2-sulfonate and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate. In the presence of 0.2 mM lawsone, over 97.5% Cr(VI) (100 mg l(-1)) was reduced in 4h. The mediated reduction occurred at initial Cr(VI) concentrations of 50-250 mg l(-1), and increased with increasing initial biomass concentrations from 0.05 to 1.2 g l(-1). The addition of glucose as electron donor promoted the reduction process. Cu(2+), Ni(2+) and Co(2+) inhibited, whereas Mn(2+) and Pb(2+) stimulated reduction. Four rounds of mediated reduction were completed in 19 h, suggesting its stability and persistence. The efficient mediated microbial reduction of Cr(VI) is promising for rapid anaerobic removal of chromate.', 20591653: 'Pseudomonas fulva TY16 biosynthesized medium-chain-length poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (MCL-PHAs) containing unsaturated 3-hydroxydodecenoate unit (approximately 8-9%) when grown with volatile aromatic compounds including benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene as sole carbon substrate. In particular, when cultivated using a continuous feeding system designed to supply toluene at a flow rate of 0.42gL(-1)h(-1) into a 7-L jar fermentor, the growth of the organism reached up to approximately 3.87gL(-1) after the 48h fed-batch fermentation, representing an accumulated cellular MCL-PHA of 58.9% by weight. The obtained MCL-PHA was a copolyester primarily consisting of 3-hydroxydecanoate (55.2%) and 3-hydroxyoctanoate (26.8%) with minor constituents being 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3.7%), 3-hydroxydodecenoate (8.2%), and 3-hydroxydodecanoate (6.1%). The present results suggest that P. fulva TY16 is a promising candidate for the biotechnological conversion of toxic petrochemical wastes to valuable biopolymers.', 20594822: 'Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) removal in mineral media using Thiobacillus thioparus TK-1 in a biofilm airlift suspension reactor (BAS) was investigated to evaluate the relationship between biofilm formation and changes in inlet loading rates. Aqueous sodium sulfide was fed as the substrate into the continuous BAS-reactor. The reactor was operated at a constant temperature of 30 degrees C and a pH of 7, the optimal temperature and pH for biomass growth. The startup of the reactor was performed with basalt carrier material. Optimal treatment performance was obtained at a loading rate of 4.8 mol S(2-) m(-3) h(-1) at a conversion efficiency as high as 100%. The main product of H(2)S oxidation in the BAS-reactor was sulfate because of high oxygen concentrations in the airlift reactor. The maximum sulfide oxidation rate was 6.7 mol S(2-) m(-3) h(-1) at a hydraulic residence time of 3.3 h in the mineral medium. The data showed that the BAS-reactor with this microorganism can be used for sulfide removal from industrial effluent.', 20594824: 'The biodegradation of TCE was studied in a laboratory scale biofilter packed with wood charcoal and inoculated with mixed culture of methanotrophs isolated from local soil. The removal efficiency was found to be higher than 90% up to an inlet load of 5.1g/m(3)h. The maximum elimination capacity was 6.7g/m(3)h at an inlet loading rate of 11.3g/m(3)h. The reaction constants EC(max,)K(s) and K(i) calculated from the experimental results are also presented. The biodegradation process is found to be inhibited at higher TCE concentration. The carbon dioxide production rate has been found to be a linear function of elimination capacity. The DNA finger printing techniques has indicated the presence of functionally active methanotrophic community including Methylocystis sp. in the biofilter.', 20603870: 'This work reports the effects of phosphoserine addition on the biodegradability of calcium phosphate cements. The characteristics of a phosphoserine-modified calcium phosphate cement without collagen in a large animal model are presented here for the first time. Critical size bone defects in the proximal tibia of 10 sheep were filled with the bone cement, and five sheep with empty defects were included as controls. The sheep were sacrificed after either 10 days or 12 weeks, and bones were processed for histological, histomorphometric and enzyme histochemical analyses as well as transmission electron microscopic examination. After 12 weeks, there was no significant reduction in either the implant or the bone defect cross-sectional area. Different amounts of fibrous tissue were observed around the implant and in the bone defect after 12 weeks. The direct bone-implant contact decreased after 12 weeks (p = 0.034). Although the implanted material properly filled the defect and promoted an initial activation of macrophages and osteoblasts, the resorption and simultaneous substitution did not reach expected levels during the experimental time course. Although other studies have shown that the addition of phosphoserine to calcium phosphate cements that have already been modified with collagen I resulted in an acceleration of cement resorption and bone regeneration, this study demonstrates that phosphoserine-modified calcium phosphate cements without collagen perform poorly in the treatment of bone defects. Efforts to use phosphoserine in the development of new composites should take into consideration the need to improve osteoconduction simultaneously via other means.', 20608501: 'To explore biodegradation of 2-naphthol and its metabolites accumulated in wastewater treatment, a series of bio-degradation experiments were conducted. Two main metabolites of 2-naphthol, 1,2-naphthalene-diol and 1,2-naphthoquinone, were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography with standards. Combining fungus Aspergillus niger with bacterium Bacillus subtilis in the treatment enhanced 2-naphthol degradation efficiency, lowered the accumulation of the two toxic metabolites. There were two main phases during the degradation process by the kinetic analysis: 2-naphthol was first partly degraded by the fungus, producing labile and easily accumulated metabolites, and then the metabolites were mainly degraded by the bacterium, attested by the degradation processes of 1,2-naphthalene-diol and 1,2-naphthoquinone as sole source of carbon and energy. Sodium succinate, as a co-metabolic substrate, was the most suitable compound for the continuous degradation. The optimum concentration of 2-naphthol was 50 mg/L. The overall 2-naphthol degradation rate was 92%, and the CODcr removal rate was 80% on day 10. These results indicated that high degradation rate of 2-naphthol should not be considered as the sole desirable criterion for the bioremediation of 2-naphthol-contaminated soils/wastewater.', 20619640: 'In this study, effect of magnetic field on the activity of activated sludge in wastewater treatment was investigated. During the experiment, biodegradation duration, magnetic density, operating temperature and medium pH value were changed within the ranges from 0 to 60h, 0 to 500.0mT, 10.0 to 50.0 degrees C and 3.0 to 12.0, respectively. These results revealed that activated sludge acclimatization and organic pollutant biodegradation processes under magnetic field were stimulated, resulting in a higher efficiency of wastewater treatment. Biodegradation of organic compounds under magnetic field could reach stable states after 48h. The organic compounds removal rate first roared up and then fell down with the increase of magnetic density of the field, turning at 20.0mT. On account of application of magnetic field, the range of temperature and pH, which is suitable for the growth of microbe, were 20.0-40.0 degrees C and 6.0-10.0, respectively, which were expanded compared with those without the magnetic field.', 20623265: 'Hydrocarbon-contaminant removal efficiency of Bambara groundnuts and biomagnification was investigated. The crude oil contaminated soil samples in which the plants were established were either un-amended, or amended with NPK, or Urea, or Poultry manure. Amendments improved phytoextraction rates as follows: Urea - 63.37%, NPK - 65.99%, Poultry - manure - 70.04%, for PAH; Urea - 78.80%, NPK - 79.80%, Poultry manure - 87.90%, for BTEX. Hazard characterization from 28-day feeding study revealed negative effects of potentially toxic BTEX and PAH on organ weight, optimum digestibility and animal growth rate. Sleep time decreased with increasing hydrocarbon concentrations probably due to increased liver enzyme activity.', 20633920: 'The introduction of acid-tolerant heterotrophic microorganisms into sludge bioleaching systems has been proven effective in improving sludge bioleaching processes, and such positive effect is mainly attributed to the biodegradation of low molecular weight organic acids or sludge dissolved organic matter (DOM) toxic to Acidithiobacillus species by the heterotrophic microorganisms introduced. Here we report that elevated dissolved CO(2) concentration and resulting extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in bioleach solution due to the incorporation of heterotrophic microorganisms also play important roles in improving sludge bioleaching. It was found that in tannery sludge bioleaching system coinoculated with Rhodotorula mucilaginosa R30 and Acidithiobacillus species, dissolved CO(2) concentration in bioleach solution can be elevated from 0.23-0.54 mg/L to 0.76-1.01 mg/L compared to the control inoculated only with Acidithiobacillus species. Correspondingly, the distinct degradation of sludge DOM was also observed in this experiment. It was experimentally demonstrated that the accumulation of CO(2) did greatly enhance the growth of Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and the decrease rate of pH in the medium. In addition, EPS derived from R. mucilaginosa R30 could bind readily Fe(3+) in bioleach solution with maximum binding capacity (MBC) of 0.82 mg Fe(3+) by per mg DOC of EPS secreted and the oxidization activity of EPS-bound Fe(3+) was decreased but not totally inhibited, indicating that the formation of soluble EPS-Fe(III) complexes enhances, to a certain extent, bioleaching efficiency due to maintaining Fe(3+) level in solution by inhibiting Fe precipitation occurrence.', 20638703: 'The growing release of nanosilver into sewage systems has increased the concerns on the potential adverse impacts of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in wastewater treatment plants. The inhibitory effects of nanosilver on wastewater treatment and the response of activated sludge bacteria to the shock loading of AgNPs were evaluated in a Modified Ludzack-Ettinger (MLE) activated sludge treatment system. Before shock-loading experiments, batch extant respirometric assays determined that at 1mg/L of total Ag, nitrification inhibitions by AgNPs (average size=1-29 nm) and Ag(+) ions were 41.4% and 13.5%, respectively, indicating that nanosilver was more toxic to nitrifying bacteria in activated sludge than silver ions. After a 12-h period of nanosilver shock loading to reach a final peak silver concentration of 0.75 mg/L in the MLE system, the total silver concentration in the mixed liquor decreased exponentially. A continuous flow-through model predicted that the silver in the activated sludge system would be washed out 25 days after the shock loading. Meanwhile, a prolonged period of nitrification inhibition (>1 month, the highest degree of inhibition=46.5%) and increase of ammonia/nitrite concentration in wastewater effluent were observed. However, nanosilver exposure did not affect the growth of heterotrophs responsible for organic matter removal. Microbial community structure analysis indicated that the ammonium-oxidizing bacteria and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, Nitrospira, had experienced population decrease while Nitrobacter was washed out after the shock loading.', 20655745: 'The conventional roll tube and plating techniques are typically time consuming and can culture in vitro only a small fraction of microbes in natural microflora. This study utilizes a novel, simple, and rapid method, the toxicity-to-extinction approach, to obtain the minimal functional consortium that can effectively degrade meta- (m-), para- (p-), and ortho- (o-) cresols. The original sludge had 16 major bands by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Microbial diversity decreased as the cresol concentration increased. The functional strains acquired under toxic stress by dosed cresols that individually degraded m-, p-, and o-cresols were identified. Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (C12D) and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23D) activities in cell-free extracts were determined spectrophotometrically and were correlated with noted changes in microbial communities under cresol stress. The proposed toxicity-to-extinction approach is feasible for isolating a functional consortium from sludge for cresol degradation.', 20656478: 'Physico-chemical factors affecting mercury elimination from solution using fern as sorbent have been analysed. It was demonstrated that interaction of mercury with this biomass follows two processes, adsorption by the functional groups in the biopolymers of the cell wall and reduction by easily oxidized compounds of the biomass. Batch experiments have been done to analyse the effect of pH, ionic strength of the media or competition with other metals. Ionic strength did not show a significant influence in the process, but mercury speciation with the formation of negatively charge complexes represented an important drawback in metal elimination. Continuous flow conditions were also analysed since many industrial applications will require them. These studies allowed distinguishing the two processes: mercury sorption was observed but also reduction of this metal occurs. Reduction to mercury (I) and metallic mercury has been confirmed by scanning electron microscopy analysis of the column filling after the continuous flow experiments.', 20659749: 'The removal of nickel in marine tropical sediments (New Caledonia) was studied in microcosms. Removal of Ni(2+) was strongly enhanced by the presence of bacteria, with rates up to twofold higher than those observed under sterilized conditions. After 8 days of incubation, Ni(2+) concentration in the water column ranged from 30% to 50% of the initial concentration according to sediment origin. Addition of glucose stimulated bacterial processes and resulted in a complete disappearance of Ni(2+) in the water phase. Incubation under anoxic conditions slightly affects the microbial structure inferred from T-RFLP analysis irrespective of Ni(2+) spiking, whereas incubation under oxic conditions resulted to moderate modification of the microbial structure, changes that might be more marked in the presence of Ni(2+). Five different T-RFs were observed in almost all microcosms with relative abundance between 5% and 30%. Incubation with glucose resulted in the dominance of a common T-RF, with relative abundance up to 39%.', 20667718: 'The thermostable Phosphotriesterase-Like Lactonase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsoPox) hydrolyzes lactones and, at a lower rate, neurotoxic organophosphorus compounds. The persistent demand of detoxification tools in the field of agricultural wastes and restoring of conditions after terrorist acts prompted us to exploit SsoPox as a \"starter\" to evolve its ancillary nerve agents hydrolytic capability. A directed evolution strategy yielded, among several variants, the single mutant W263F with k(cat) and specificity constant against paraoxon 16- and 6-fold enhanced, respectively, compared to the wild type. Furthermore, a phenomenon of enzyme activation by SDS has been observed, which allowed to increase those values 150- and 28-fold, respectively. The activity of SsoPox against the deadly nerve gas Cyclosarin has been reported for the first time and proved to be substantially unaffected for variant W263F. Finally, outperforming efficiency of W263F was demonstrated, under severe stressing conditions, with respect to the best known phosphotriesterase PTE from Brevundimonas diminuta.', 20673716: 'Laccase from Trametes versicolor was successfully in situ encapsulated into the poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA)/PEO-PPO-PEO (F108) electrospun microfibers by emulsion electrospinning. The porous morphology of electrospun microfibers was observed with scanning electron microscope, and the core-shell structure of microfibers and existence of laccase in microfibers were proved by laser confocal scanning microscopy micrograph. In this study, fibrous porosity and core-shell structure are advantageous to the activity and stability preservation of immobilized laccase. The activity of immobilized laccase could retain over 67% of that of the free enzyme. After 10 successive runs in the enzyme reactor, the immobilized laccase could also maintain 50% of its initial activity. Crystal violet dye was successfully degraded by the PDLLA/F108-laccase electrospun microfiber membranes. It was observed that the immobilized laccase possessed a broadening pH range of catalysis activity compared to free laccase.', 20708388: 'In this study the capacity of the newly isolated environmental strain Aeromonas hydrophila was evaluated. The influence of three surfactants: rhamnolipides, saponins and Triton X-100 on cell surface properties of the A. hydrophila environmental strain and the biodegradation process of diesel oil was studied. The surface activities in water, a mineral salts medium and in the biological system of all considered surfactants were estimated by means of equilibrium surface tension experiments. The obtained results indicated that critical micellar concentration in the biological system is twice higher for saponins and Triton X-100, and three times higher for rhamnolipides. Our results indicated also, that cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) of bacteria is correlated with carbon sources in broth medium. The mechanism of surfactant action seems to be dependent on the type and concentration of surfactant used in the studies. The best effect of saponins on diesel oil biodegradation was observed using the A. hydrophila strain, diesel oil biodegradation after 21 days was 78%.', 20713308: 'Several microorganisms produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). They are accumulated intracellularly as energy storage compounds. The PHAs are of interest because of their potential in biomedical applications. Halophilic bacteria and archaea are known to produce polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). This paper describes production of a biodegradable copolymer, PHB-co-PHV by a moderately haloalkalitolerant Halomonas campisalis, isolated from Lonar Lake, India. The production of PHA was in the range of 45-81% on dry cell weight basis when the organism was grown in a production medium containing 1% (w/v) maltose and 0.1% (w/v) yeast extract, at pH ranging from 6 to 9 with an inoculum density of 10(5)-10(7) cells/ml of medium, for incubation period of 15-30 h and at 37 degrees C. The polymer produced by the organism is a hydroxyester with molecular weight of 1.3014 x 10(6). Its melting temperature was 171 degrees C. The (1)H NMR analysis revealed that the polymer was a copolymer of PHB-co-PHV. This could be achieved by providing simple carbon source viz. maltose.', 20714920: 'The application of biocides is a traditional method of controlling biodecay of outdoor cultural heritage. Chlorophyll degradation to phaeopigments is used to test the biocidal efficacy of the antimicrobial agents. In the present study, the usefulness of color measurements in estimating chlorophyll degradation was investigated. An aeroterrestrial stone biofilm-forming cyanobacterium of the genus Nostoc was chosen as test organism, comparing its different behaviour in both planktonic and biofilm mode of growth against the isothiazoline biocide Biotin T®. Changes in A(435 nm)/A(415 nm) and A(665 nm)/A(665a nm) and in the chlorophyll a and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cell content were compared with the variations in the CIELAB color parameters (L*, a*, b*, C*(ab) and h(ab)). Our findings showed that both the phaeophytination indexes are useful in describing degradation of chlorophyl a to phaeopigments. Moreover, the CIELAB color parameters represented an effective tool in describing chlorophyll degradation. L* CIELAB parameter appeared to be the most informative parameter in describing the biocidal activity of Biotin T® against Nostoc sp. in both planktonic and biofilm mode of growth.', 20716485: \"An extracellular laccase was purified from the culture medium of the non-white rot, anthracene-degrading fungal strain Fusarium solani MAS2. Both native PAGE and SDS-PAGE revealed one single band corresponding to a molecular weight of about 72 kDa. Treatment with endoglycosidase H reduced the molecular weight by 12%. The purified laccase maintained stable at pH 3-11 and up to 50 degrees C. The highest activity was detected at pH 3.0 and at 70 degrees C. The enzyme retained 46.2-97.2% of it activity in the presence of 20mM Pb(2+), Ni(2+), Cr(3+), and its activity was enhanced in the presence of 20mM Hg(2+). The laccase retained more than 50% of its activity in the presence of 5% acetone, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), ethanol and methanol. The kinetic constants (K(m) and k(cat)) showed that 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMOP) and 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) were the more effective substrates rather than catechol and guaiacol. The novel properties of this laccase suggest its potential for biotechnological and environmental applications.\", 20719501: 'We investigated cadmium(II) resistance and its association with exopolysaccharide (EPS) production in cyanobacteria. Increased EPS production was associated with Cd(II) resistance. The most resistant isolate, Synechocystis sp. BASO670, secreted the greatest amount of EPS (548 mg/L). EPS production by Synechocystis sp. BASO670 and Synechocystis sp. BASO672 was increased following exposure to 15 and 35 ppm Cd(II). Monomer composition of EPS belonging to each isolate was changed after Cd(II) treatment. Uronic acid contents of Cd(II) treated cells were higher than control cells of each isolate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis confirmed that a considerable amount of metals had precipitated on the cell surface. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum analysis of EPSs belonging to both isolates indicated the presence of C-H and C-O group, which may serve as binding sites for divalent cations.', 20728345: 'The antibiotics tylosin and chlortetracycline (CTC), which are commonly used in pig production, were studied to determine their effects on swine manure digestion in the presence and absence of biocide sodium azide. CTC enhanced initial hydrolysis reactions through volatile suspended solids production, while inhibiting methane and carbon dioxide production. Tylosin did not affect methane and carbon dioxide production; however, the relative abundance of both hydrogen utilizing and acetate-only utilizing microbial populations was significantly compromised. Sodium azide in the absence of antibiotics enhanced metabolic output and initial biomass production, and this observation suggests that populations of Methanobacteriales and Methanosaetaceae spp. appeared to contain sufficient periplasmic bound reductase to effectively utilize acetate and hydrogen in the presence of sodium azide. However, the combination of sodium azide and either CTC or tylosin was a very effective metabolic inhibitor, inhibiting methane and carbon dioxide production and VSS consumption compared to their no-azide counterpart.', 20728349: 'A Gram-positive bacterium, N52, that produces intracellular glucan from l-arabinose, was isolated from soil and identified as Sporosarcina sp. according to rRNA gene sequence analysis and physiological/biochemical characterizations. Glucan production by N52 increased significantly in the exponential phase of aerobic liquid culture and was maintained at the highest level during the stationary phase, reaching 37.0% of the cell dry weight. The glucan was also produced from other tested sugars originating from plant cell walls and was composed exclusively of alpha-1,4- and alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages. When distillery waste was treated with N52 for 72 h, the total organic carbon (TOC), chemical oxygen demand and biochemical oxygen demand were reduced by 42.6%, 45.9% and 82.5%, respectively. Bacterial cells accumulated 31.9% of glucan per cell dry weight, fixing 16.0% of the TOC in the soluble fraction. Thus, this strain could provide us with a new process for waste management, including the bioconversion of organic materials to the valuable byproduct, alpha-glucan.', 20734624: 'Phytoremediation of selected pharmaceuticals (diclofenac, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen) using Armoracia rusticana and Linum usitatissimum cell cultures and by hydroponically cultivated Lupinus albus, Hordeum vulgaris, and Phragmites australis plants in laboratory conditions is described. During in vitro experiments, the best results for acetaminophen were achieved using Armoracia rusticana hairy root cultures, where 100% of the starting amount was removed from the media during eight days. Total removal of ibuprofen and diclofenac was achieved using a Linum usitatissimum suspension culture after one and six days, respectively. In the hydroponic arrangement, the best results were achieved for Lupinus, where acetaminophen was totally removed from media during two or four days in concentrations of 0.1 or 0.2 mM, respectively. The best effectiveness of ibuprofen removal (50% of starting amount) was found in case of Phragmites. Effectiveness of all tested plants for diclofenac removal was low. The best removal was achieved using Phragmites in the case of 0.2 mM concentration-67% of the starting amount and Hordeum for 0.1 mM starting concentration, 56%.', 20734628: 'The degradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in an aged creosote-contaminated soil in the presence of Salix viminalis was investigated in a greenhouse experiment. Phenanthrene and pyrene were degraded 100% and 80%, respectively, in the presence of plants but only 68% and 63% without plants. The effects of the nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 or the addition of straw, without plants, were also studied. The addition of straw had no effect on PAH degradation compared to the control Pyrene degradation with Triton X-100 at low concentrations (0.06 microl g(-1) DW) was comparable to that with plants but was less for anthracene and phenanthrene. The treatments with plants were, according to SIR measurements, dominated by active microorganisms (98.8% of the biomass), whereas all treatments without plants contained mostly dormant or non-growing microorganisms (1.7-2.0% active). Viable counts and active biomass were highly correlated in all treatments and demonstrated that S. viminalis greatly increased microbial populations. Dominant bacteria were grouped according to Gram, fluorescence and oxidase tests and revealed differences between treatments. The presence of S. viminalis or the surfactant enhanced PAH degradation, primarily by a rhizosphere effect on the microbial activity in the former case and by increased bioavailability in the latter case.', 20734630: 'We aimed to optimize germination and growth conditions of the arsenic hyperaccumulating fern, Pteris vittata L. Pot experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of soil pH, soil calcium (Ca) concentration, and temperature on the sexual propagation of P. vittata. At 25 degrees C, germination was both accelerated and increased by high soil pH and Ca concentration. Spores of P. vittata did not germinate on medium with a pH of 4.6. Amending strongly acid soils with 27.5 or 40 micromol/g Ca(OH)2 significantly improved the growth rate during both the germination phase and the gametophyte phase. Amending strongly acid soils with NaOH (55 micromol/g) promoted germination, but did not affect subsequent growth. Among the different temperature, germination and growth rates were higher at 25 degrees C than at 20 degrees C or 30 degrees C. The distribution of P. vittata in China might be influenced by its requirement for high pH and high Ca concentration in the soil and appropriate growth temperature to complete sexual propagation. These results provided important information for improving breeding conditions of P. vitatta and will be helpful for extending the range of areas in which P. vittata can be used for phytoremediation.', 20734632: 'Variability of cadmium tolerance and distribution in plant organs was investigated in ten selected poplar clones from different species, hybrids and genotypes. To this end, plants were exposed for three weeks to 50 microM CdSO4 in hydroponics. Cadmium accumulation in roots, stem and leaves as well as biomass production and photosynthesis maintenance varied greatly among clones. The metal mostly accumulated in roots, up to 80% in some clones, and interestingly, only 50% in some others. In general, metal tolerance reflected the degree of photosynthesis inhibition, which was higher in clones with high cadmium accumulation in leaves. Biomass production, net photosynthesis, transpiration, and pigment content were differently reduced in cadmium-treated clones with respect to control. The variability of cadmium distribution among leaves, stem, and roots provides candidate poplars for specific phytoremediation processes of contaminated waters and soils.', 20734633: 'Arsenic (As) hyperaccumulating ferns are used to phytoremediate As-contaminated soils, including soils in residential areas. This use may pose a health risk if children were to ingest these plants. Spider brake (Pteris cretica L.) plants were grown in sand spiked with arsenate, to produce tissue As concentrations (2000-4500 mg kg DW(-1)) typical of those observed in plants deployed for As phytoremediation. The fronds were subjected to a physiologically-based extraction test to estimate As bioaccessibility, which ranged from 3.4-20.5%. A scenario for human dietary exposure to As in an urban setting was then estimated for a child consuming 0.25 g DW of tissue. The calculation of dietary exposure took into account the As concentration in the fern pinnae, the bioaccessibility of As in the tissue, and the typical absorption of inorganic As by the gastrointestinal tract. The pinnae As concentrations and the calculated dietary exposures were used to create a non-linear regression model relating tissue As concentration to dietary exposure. Data from a phytoremediation project in a residential area using Pteris cretica and Pteris vittata (L.) were input into this model to project dietary As exposure in a residential phytoremediation setting. These exposures were compared to estimates of dietary As exposure from the consumption of soil. The results showed that dietary exposures to As from consumption of soil or pinnae tissue were similar and that estimates of dietary exposure were below the LOAEL value of 14 microg As kg(-1) d(-1). The results suggest that the hyperaccumulation of As in Pteris ferns during growth in moderately contaminated residential soils (e.g., < or = 100 mg As kg DW(-1)) does not represent an inherent risk or a risk substantially different from that posed by accidental ingestion of contaminated soil.', 20734910: 'Scirpus americanus Pers. occurs naturally in \"San Germán,\" a pond that serves as a receptor of industrial wastewater in Guanajuato, México. This plant accumulates metals mainly in the root: concentrations (mg/kg) of Cr, As, Cd and Se were 970, 49, 41, and 85 respectively. Analysis of rhizosphere samples indicated bacterial population of 10(8) cfu g(-1) in media with 0.2 mM Cr(VI) and 10 mM sodium gluconate. Thirteen isolates were obtained and phylogenetic analyses (16S rRNA) indicated they corresponded to genera of Agrobacterium, Arthrobacter, Microbacterium, Curtobacterium, Rhodococcus, Xanthomonas and Pseudomonas. Cr(VI) reduction was evaluated using the diphenyl carbazide method. The isolates accomplished 5-40% (20 microM) of reduction in assays of resting cell and tolerated 0.5-5.0 mM Cr(VI). Eight strains used nitrate and thirteen used iron and chromium as electron acceptors to grow under anaerobic conditions. Cr(VI) reduction by five strains occurred at pH values (7-9) and NaCl concentrations (0.5-1.0 M) in basal medium. A mixed culture of strains (S17 and S28) reached a chromium removal of 100% at 0.2 mM Cr(VI) initial concentration. Aerobically, this consortium was capable of 93.8% Cr(VI) reduction of 81 microg L(-1) Cr(VI) of the industrial effluent, indicating their possible use in environmental cleanup.', 20734913: 'The response of Populus tremula x tremuloides cv. Etrepole transgenic lines expressing the phytochelatin synthase TaPCS1 for Pb tolerance and accumulation was studied. In a hydroponic experiment, the concentrations of Pb in plants did not differ significantly between any of the transgenic lines assayed and the wild type (wt) plants, with any of the Pb solutions tested. However, total biomass and Pb accumulation were significantly higher in transgenic lines (PTa3, PTa5, PTa10) than in the control (wt) line when the plants were grown in solutions containing 0.75 and 1.5 mM Pb. The PTa3 and PTa5 lines accumulated 1.7 times more Pb than the wt plants. A concentration of 3.0 mM Pb was found to be toxic for both transgenic and wt plants. Biomass production was higher in transgenic lines PTa3 and PTaS than in the wt plants growing in M4 mining soil, accumulating more Pb and Zn than in the wt plants. When the plant material was grown in soil M15, none of the parameters differed significantly between the transgenic and wt plants. The different response in soils M4 and M15 indicated that the physicochemical properties of the soil play a determinant role in the phytoremediation potential.', 20734915: 'This study investigated the contributions of mixed arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) inoculum-i.e., mixed populations of indigenous mycorrhiza (Glomus intraradices, Glomus geosporum, Glomus mosseae) (IM) isolated from arsenic (As) contaminated soil and non-indigenous mycorrhiza such as G. mosseae (GM), which possess metal tolerance characteristics-and the addition of phosphate rock (PR) towards the uptake and accumulation of As by Pteris vittata (As hyperaccumlator) grown in As-contaminated soil. Regardless of As levels added to soil, plant growth was substantially improved in amended treatments when compared with the control. In addition, root surface area (0 mg/kg As: 15.2 cm2; 150 mg/kg As: 16.9 cm2; 300 mg/kg As: 20.7 cm2), chlorophyll contents (0 mg/kg As: 1.16 mg/g; 150 mg/kg As: 1.46 mg/g; 300 mg/kg As: 1.81 mg/g) and As translocation factor (0 mg/kg As: 0; 150 mg/kg As: 4.29; 300 mg/kg As: 5.22) in P. vittata of PR+IM/GM were also increased.

Cucurbita pepo ssp. pepo cv. Howden pumpkins were grown in 100 g of DDT contaminated soil ([DDT] - 1100 ng/g) mixed with equal volumes of either clean soil, perlite, vermiculite, peat, potting soil, or granular activated carbon (GAC) to give total organic carbon contents of 2.4%, 2.5%, 2.6%, 11.5%, 12.2%, and 27.3%, respectively. As in other studies, root DDT concentrations were significantly lower in soils with high organic matter. Root bioaccumulation factors (BAF = [DDT]root/[DDT]soil) approximated this trend. Root concentrations correlated with organic matter concentrations and not with soil DDT concentrations. Conversely, shoot DDT concentrations, shoot BAFs and translocation factors (TLF = BAF(shoot)/BAF(root)) were not significantly different between treatment groups, except for plants grown in GAC/DDT soil. This suggests that amendments with a range of organic matter contents may be added to improve soil conditions at industrial sites without significant adverse effects on phytoextraction potential of C. pepo ssp. pepo.', 20832263: \"Biodegradable hydrogels are important biomaterials for tissue engineering and drug delivery. For the purpose of corneal regenerative medicine, we describe an in situ formed hydrogel based on a water-soluble derivative of chitosan, hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCTS), and sodium alginate dialdehyde (SAD). Periodate oxidized alginate rapidly cross-links HPCTS due to Schiff's base formation between the available aldehyde and amino groups. Hydrogel cytotoxicity, degradability and histocompatibility in vivo were examined. The potential of the composite hydrogel for corneal endothelium reconstruction was demonstrated by encapsulating corneal endothelial cells (CECs) to grow on Descemet's membranes. The results demonstrate that the composite hydrogel was both non-toxic and biodegradable and that CECs transplanted by the composite hydrogel could survive and retain normal morphology. These results provide an opportunity for corneal endothelium reconstruction based on tissue engineering by the in situ formed composite hydrogel.\", 20843682: 'A root nodule bacterium, Sinorhizobium meliloti CCNWSX0020, resistant to 1.4 mM Cu2+ was isolated from Medicago lupulina growing in mine tailings. In medium supplied with copper, this bacterium showed cell deformation and aggregation due to precipitation of copper on the cell surface. Genes similar to the copper-resistant genes, pcoR and pcoA from Escherichia coli, were amplified by PCR from a 1.4-Mb megaplasmid. Inoculation with S. meliloti CCNWSX0020 increased the biomass of M. lupulina grown in medium added 0 and 100 mg Cu2+ kg(-1) by 45.8% and 78.2%, respectively, and increased the copper concentration inside the plant tissues grown in medium supplied with 100 μM Cu2+ by 39.3%, demonstrating that it is a prospective symbiotic system for bioremediation purposes.', 20855194: 'Bacillus sp. ADR secretes an extracellular laccase in nutrient broth, and this enzyme was purified up to 56-fold using acetone precipitation and DEAE-cellulose anion exchange chromatography. The molecular weight of purified laccase was estimated to be 66 kDa using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified laccase oxidized 2,6-dimethoxy phenol, o-tolidine, hydroquinone, L-DOPA and guaiacol. The optimum pH for oxidation of o-tolidine, 2,6-dimethoxy phenol and guaiacol were 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0, respectively. The purified laccase contained 2.7 mol/mol of copper. The laccase was stable up to 40 °C and within the pH range of 7.0-9.0. Well-known inhibitors of multicopper oxidases such as, sodium azide, L-cysteine and dithiothreitol showed significant inhibition of laccase activity.

Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, a common technology used in water and wastewater treatment, may help reduce aqueous concentrations of degradation products produced during biological treatment and their associated hazards. Combined biological and UV transformations may be important in natural systems as well. We investigated the effects of UV irradiation (254 nm) on dibenzothiophene (DBT), a sulfur-containing polyaromatic hydrocarbon, in artificial seawater, and its effects on biodegradation products produced from mixed-community microbial transformations of DBT, including DBT sulfone, DBT sulfoxide, hydroxylated and carboxylated benzothiophenes, thiosalicylic acid, and others. Toxicity of solutions after UV exposure was monitored using bioluminescent bacteria (Vibrio fischeri) and by evaluating cardiac deformities in Fundulus heteroclitus embryos. The highest UV fluence reduced DBT concentration by 28% when DBT was present as the sole organic solute. In postbiodegradation solution, the same fluence reduced the initial concentration of DBT by 81%, and 11 DBT biodegradation products to trace levels. Regardless of UV fluence, DBT by itself produced minimal effects in Fundulus embryos but was moderately toxic to V. fischeri. Postbiodegradation solutions were highly toxic to both test organisms. The highest UV fluence slightly reduced toxicity of postbiodegradation solution to V. fischeri but exacerbated cardiac deformities in Fundulus embryos. Toxicity could not be attributed to specific products and was likely a result of mixture effects. These results emphasize that toxicity can increase during remediation and that multiple assays may be necessary for evaluation. The novel approach of combined biodegradation/UV treatment is promising, although further research is needed to reduce toxicity in the case of DBT.', 20863693: 'Adaptation of Penicillium simplicissimum with different heavy metals present in a spent hydrocracking catalyst, as well as one-step, two-step, and spent medium bioleaching of the spent catalyst by the adapted fungus, was examined in batch cultures. Adaptation experiments with the single metal ions Ni, Mo, Fe, and W showed that the fungus could tolerate up to 1500 mg/L Ni, 8000 mg/L Mo, 3000 mg/L Fe, and 8000 mg/L W. In the presence of multi-metals, the fungus was able to tolerate up to 300 mg/L Ni, 200 mg/L Mo, 150 mg/L Fe and 2500 mg/L W. A total of 3% (w/v) spent catalyst generally gave the maximum extraction yields in the two-step bioleaching process (100% of W, 100% of Fe, 92.7% of Mo, 66.43% of Ni, and 25% of Al). The main lixiviant in the bioleaching was shown to be gluconic acid.

Five sets of experiments were carried out in shake flask and microcosm conditions with crude oil as follows: Set 1-only bacterial cells added (no fertilizer and biosurfactant), Set 2-with additional fertilizer only, Set 3-with additional biosurfactant only, Set 4-with added biosurfactant+fertilizer, Set 5-with no bacterial cells added (control), all the above experimental sets were incubated for 168 h. The biosurfactant+fertilizer added Set 4, resulted in maximum crude oil degradation within shake flask and microcosm conditions. Among the three bacterial isolates, P. aeruginosa and biosurfactant produced by this strain resulted in maximum crude oil degradation compared to the other two bacterial strains investigated. Interestingly, when biosurfactant and bacterial cells were used (Set 3), significant oil biodegradation activity occurred and the difference between this treatment and that in Set 4 with added fertilizer+biosurfactant were only 4-5% higher degradation level in shake flask and 3.2-7% in microcosm experiments for all three bacterial strains used. It is concluded that, biosurfactants alone capable of promoting biodegradation to a large extent without added fertilizers, which will reduce the cost of bioremediation process and minimizes the dilution or wash away problems encountered when water soluble fertilizers used during bioremediation of aquatic environments.', 20863700: 'Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans strain SRDSM2 was isolated from silica containing soil sample collected at a Rajpardi lignite mine.

The presence of 4 mM of zinc as zinc sulphate in the medium increased the IOR by 24.4%. Forty percent of the inoculated cells survived even after exposure at 80 °C for 120 min and showed 30% ferrous iron oxidation. The Vmax and Ks for iron oxidation by the isolate were 344.82 mg/L/h and 32.25 g/L respectively. The isolate was able to oxidized ferrous iron even in presence of 4.06 M ionic strength of medium and leached>85% copper and zinc from the polymetallic concentrate.

The hill A5, a waste dump of the chemical factory, was chosen as the study area, in order to assess the metal accumulation ability of the vegetation growing under HM stress. The plant species, biodiversity and health were related to the concentration of HMs in four areas of the hill A5, and to the metal accumulation in shoots and roots. Uptake of HMs occurred at different extent in the various plant species and differed according to the considered organ and metal. Polygonum aviculare hyperaccumulated Hg in the shoot suggesting its possible exploitation in phytoextraction.

Corn starch was ionically cross-linked with calcium chloride. It was found that the cross-linked starch could be used for entrapment and controlled release of bioactive molecules. The release rate of large molecules was degradation-dependent due to amylase activity, which might target the release to the intestine, when the particles were taken orally. The release of small molecules such as salicylic acid, was mainly by diffusion.', 20926291: \"This study investigated the fate of enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) and changes in microbial speciation in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) fed with aspartate and glutamate. It involved SBR operation for 288 days, batch tests for observation of metabolic functions together with microscopic and phylogenetic analyses. Polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) were observed in abundance with complete removal of phosphorus. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with 4',6-dia-midino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining confirmed the accumulation of polyphosphate by Rhodocyclus-related and Actinobacterial PAOs. Aspartate seemed to favor the competitive growth of Rhodocyclus-related PAOs since EBPR population used the common biochemical pathways followed by Rhodocyclus-related PAOs in the aspartate fed batch tests. In the glutamate fed batch reactors, however, Actinobacterial PAOs appeared to be competitively selected which explains the lower levels of PHA generation. Even though operational conditions did not change, effective EBPR could not be maintained during the latter part of the study.\", 20933400: \"An extracellular laccase-producing ascomycete was isolated from soil and identified as Paraconiothyrium variabile using rDNA sequence analysis. Typical laccase substrates including 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate) (ABTS), 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP), and guaiacol were oxidized by the purified enzyme (designated as PvL). The molecular mass of PvL was 84 kDa and it showed a pI value of 4.2. The enzyme acted optimally at pH 4.8 and exhibited an optimum temperature of 50 °C. Using ABTS, PvL represented Km and Vmax of 203 μM and 40 μmol min(-1) mg(-1), respectively. After 24 h incubation at pH 4.8 and 4 °C, 80% of the initial activity of PvL remained. The enzyme was inhibited by Fe2+, Hg2+, and Mn2+, but induced by Cu2+. EDTA (10 mM), 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) (0.1 mM), and NaN3 (10 mM) were found to completely inhibit PvL. Sixty-eight percent of Malachite green was decolorized by 4 U/mL of PvL after 15 min incubation at 30 °C.\", 20933401: 'Bacillus licheniformis R08 biomass was immobilized on γ-Al2O3 and the effects of R08 biomass loading, SO2 concentration, water vapor, oxygen and temperature on removal of SO2 were investigated. The experimental results indicated that SO2 saturation capacity increased with increasing R08 biomass loading and SO2 concentration, but decreased with increasing adsorption temperature. Water vapor activated the adsorbent and promoted SO2 removal. An increase in oxygen concentration from 5 to 10% had little effect on SO2 removal. FTIR analysis revealed that the R08 biomass bound to γ-Al2O3 mainly by forming R-CO-O-Al bonds. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicated that γ-Al2O3 reacted with SO2 and formed aluminum sulfate in the presence of oxygen when R08 biomass loading was 13.8%, but that amido groups of the R08 biomass reacted with SO2 and formed sulfite when biomass loading was 32.4%. Ten continuous adsorption-desorption cycles showed that the adsorbent had an excellent regeneration performance.', 20934327: 'The yeast population dynamics in olive wastewaters (OMW), sampled in five mills from Salento (Apulia, Southern Italy), were investigated. Three hundred yeasts were isolated in five industrial mills and identified by molecular analysis. Strains belonging to Geotrichum, Saccharomyces, Pichia, Rhodotorula and Candida were detected. Five G. candidum strains were able to grow in OMW as the sole carbon source and to reduce phenolics, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and antimicrobial compounds. One G. candidum isolate was selected for whole-cell immobilization in calcium alginate gel. The COD and phenolic reduction obtained with immobilized cells showed a 2.2- and 2-fold increase compared to the removal obtained with free cells, respectively. The immobilization system enhanced yeast oxidative activity by avoiding the presence of microbial protease in treated OMW. To our knowledge, this is the first report on G. candidum whole-cell immobilization for OMW bioremediation.', 20935362: 'Copper inhibition of enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) was examined in batch experiments under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Inhibition was represented by both acetate uptake and phosphorus release coefficients under anaerobic conditions, and by a phosphorus uptake coefficient under aerobic conditions. The results showed that copper inhibition of EBPR occurred mainly during aerobic phosphorus uptake and a first-order phosphorus uptake coefficient can be better used to describe the inhibition effect. For the aerobic phosphorus uptake using the EBPR activated sludge, (i) copper inhibition started at 0.07 mg/l, (ii) 50% and 100% inhibition occurred at 0.30 mg/l and 0.53 mg/l, respectively, and (iii) the inhibition constant was 0.48 mg/l.', 20951579: 'Desugared molasses (DM), a syrup residue from beet-molasses, was investigated for biogas production in both batch and in continuously-stirred tank reactor (CSTR) experiments. DM contained 2-3 times higher concentration of ions than normal molasses, which could inhibit the biogas process. The effect of sodium and potassium concentration on biogas production from manure was also investigated. Fifty percent inhibition occurred at sodium and potassium concentration of 11 and 28 g/L, respectively. The reactor experiments were carried out to investigate the biogas production from DM under different dilutions with water and co-digestion with manure. Stable operation at maximum methane yield of 300 mL-CH4/gVS-added was obtained at a mixture of 5% DM in cow manure. The biogas process was inhibited at DM concentrations higher than 15%. Manure was a good base substrate for co-digestion, and a stable anaerobic digestion could be achieved by co-digesting DM with manure at the concentration below 15% DM.', 20951580: 'Upon treatment with Cd and As cattail (Typha latifolia) showed induced catalase, monodehydroascorbate reductase and ascorbate peroxidase activities in leaves but strong inhibition in rhizomes. Peroxidase activity in leaves of the same plants was inhibited whereas linear increase was detected after Cd treatment in rhizomes. Glutathione S-transferase measurements resulted in identical effects of the trace elements on the substrates CDNB, DCNB, NBC, NBoC, fluorodifen. When GST was assayed with the model substrate DCNB, a different pattern of activity was observed, with strongly increasing activities at increasing HM concentrations. Consequently, to improve the success rates, future phytoremediation plans need to preselect plant species with high antioxidative enzyme activities and an alert GST pattern capable of detoxifying an array of organic xenobiotics.', 20952191: 'In order to realize the separated ethanol fermentation of glucose and xylose, prehydrolysis of corn stover with sulfuric acid at moderate temperature was applied, while inhibitors were produced inevitably. A complex extraction was adopted to detoxify the prehydrolyzate before fermentation to ethanol with Pichia stipitis CBS 5776. The best proportion of mixed extractant was 30% trialkylamine-50% n-octanol -20% kerosene. Detoxification results indicated that 73.3% of acetic acid, 45.7% of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and 100% of furfural could be removed. Compared with the undetoxified prehydrolyzate, the fermentability of the detoxified prehydrolyzate was significantly improved. After 48 h fermentation of the detoxified prehydrolyzate containing 7.80 g/l of glucose and 52.8 g/l of xylose, the sugar utilization ratio was 93.2%; the ethanol concentration reached its peak value of 21.8 g/l, which was corresponding to 82.3% of the theoretical value.', 20964580: 'The application of porous hydroxyapatite-collagen (HAp-Collagen) as a bone tissue engineering scaffold is hindered by two main problems: its high cost and low initial strength. As a native 3-dimenssional collagen framework, purified porcine acellular dermal matrix (PADM) has been successfully used as a skin tissue engineering scaffold. Here we report its application as a matrix for the preparation of HAp to produce a bone tissue scaffold through a biomimetic chemical process. The HAp-PADM scaffold has two-level pore structure, with large channels (∼100\\u2009μm in diameter) inherited from the purified PADM microstructure and small pores (<100\\u2009nm in diameter) formed by self-assembled HAp on the channel surfaces. The obtained HAp-PADM scaffold (S15D) has a compressive elastic modulus as high as 600\\u2009kPa. The presence of HAp in sample S15D reduces the degradation rate of PADM in collagenase solution at 37°C. After 7 day culture of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteroblasts, MTT data show no statistically significant difference on pure PADM framework and HAp-PADM scaffold (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Because of its high strength and nontoxicity, its simple preparation method, and designable and tailorable properties, the HAp-PADM scaffold is expected to have great potential applications in medical treatment of bone defects.', 20964581: 'This study investigated the delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding bone morphogenetic protein-2 in the form of polyplexes with a biodegradable branched triacrylate/amine polycationic polymer (TAPP) that were complexed with gelatin microparticles (GMPs) loaded within a porous tissue engineering scaffold. More specifically, the study investigated the interplay between TAPP degradation, gelatin degradation, pDNA release, and bone formation in a critical-size rat cranial defect model. The pDNA release kinetics in vitro were not affected by the crosslinking density of the GMPs but depended, rather, on the degradation rates of the TAPPs. Besides the initial release of polyplexes not bound to the GMPs and the minimal release of polyplexes through diffusion or dissociation from the GMPs, the pDNA was likely released as naked pDNA or as part of an incomplete polyplex, after the degradation of fragments of the polycationic polymer. After 30 days, significantly higher amounts of pDNA were released (93%-98%) from composite scaffolds containing naked pDNA or pDNA complexed with P-AEPZ (synthesized with 1-[2-aminoethyl]piperazine, a faster degrading TAPP) compared with those containing pDNA complexed with P-DED (synthesized with N,N-dimethylethylenediamine, a slower degrading TAPP) (74%-82%). Composite scaffolds containing GMPs complexed with TAPP/pDNA polyplexes did not result in enhanced bone formation, as analyzed by microcomputed tomography and histology, in a critical-size rat cranial defect at 12 weeks postimplantation compared with those loaded with naked pDNA. The results demonstrate that polycationic polymers with a slow degradation rate can prolong the release of pDNA from the composite scaffolds and suggest that a gene delivery system comprising biodegradable polycationic polymers should be designed to release the pDNA in an intact polyplex form.', 21036601: 'To improve 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) production by an economic and efficient approach, hemicellulosic hydrolysates (HH) used as cosubstrate resulted in more biomass and higher reducing power for 1,3-PD production. The effects of primary degradation products such as individual sugars (xylose, glucose, mannose, arabinose and galactose) and major inhibitors (furfural, acetate and formate) on the Klebsiella pneumoiae growth and 1,3-PD production were investigated in this study. Xylose and mannose could efficiently promote the 1,3-PD production and cell growth. Furfural (0.28 g/l) and sodium acetate (1.46 g/l) in low concentration were not inhibitory to Klebsiella pneumoniae, rather they have stimulatory effect on the growth and 1,3-PD biosynthesis, especially the acetate. In fed-batch fermentation with HH as cosubstrate, the final 1,3-PD production, conversion from glycerol and productivity were 71.58 g/l, 0.65 mol/mol and 1.93 g/l/h, respectively, which were 17.8%, 25.0% and 17.7% higher than that from glycerol alone.', 21052863: 'The effects of two biosurfactants, tea saponin (TS) and rhamnolipid (RL), on the production of laccase and the degradation of phenol by P. simplicissimum were investigated in solid-state fermentation consisting of rice straw, rice bran, and sawdust. Firstly, the effects of phenol on the fermentation process were studied in the absence of surfactants. Then, a phenol concentration of 3\\xa0mg/g in the fermentation was selected for detailed research with the addition of biosurfactants. The results showed that TS and RL at different concentrations had stimulative effects on the enzyme activity of laccase. The highest laccase activities during the fermentation were enhanced by 163.7%, 68.2%, and 23.3% by TS at concentrations of 0.02%, 0.06%, and 0.10%, respectively. As a result of the enhanced laccase activity, the efficiency of phenol degradation was also improved by both biosurfactants. RL caused a significant increase of fungal biomass in the early stage of the fermentation, while TS had an inhibitory effect in the whole process. These results indicated that RL could mitigate the negative effects of phenol on fungal growth and consequently improve laccase production and phenol degradation. TS was potentially applicable to phenol-polluted solid-state fermentation.', 21058948: 'Root carbon (C) inputs may regulate decomposition rates in soil, and in this study we ask: how do labile C inputs regulate decomposition of plant residues, and soil microbial communities? In a 14 d laboratory incubation, we added C compounds often found in root exudates in seven different concentrations (0, 0.7, 1.4, 3.6, 7.2, 14.4 and 21.7 mg C g(-1) soil) to soils amended with and without (13) C-labeled plant residue. We measured CO(2) respiration and shifts in relative fungal and bacterial rRNA gene copy numbers using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Increased labile C input enhanced total C respiration, but only addition of C at low concentrations (0.7 mg C g(-1)) stimulated plant residue decomposition (+2%). Intermediate concentrations (1.4, 3.6 mg C g(-1)) had no impact on plant residue decomposition, while greater concentrations of C (>7.2 mg C g(-1)) reduced decomposition (-50%). Concurrently, high exudate concentrations (>3.6 mg C g(-1)) increased fungal and bacterial gene copy numbers, whereas low exudate concentrations (<3.6 mg C g(-1)) increased metabolic activity rather than gene copy numbers. These results underscore that labile soil C inputs can regulate decomposition of more recalcitrant soil C by controlling the activity and relative abundance of fungi and bacteria.', 21068394: 'Previous genetic studies in Sphingomonas macrogolitabida strain TFA have established that expression of genes involved in tetralin biodegradation (thn genes) requires the function of the LysR type activator ThnR and also ThnY. Sequence comparison indicated that ThnY is homologous to bacterial oxygenase-coupled NAD(P)H-dependent ferredoxin reductases. However, ThnY showed substitutions in highly conserved positions of the pyridine nucleotide binding domain of these ferredoxin reductases. ThnY expression is co-regulated with all other genes required for tetralin biodegradation, and presumably thnY is part of the thnCA3A4RY operon. ThnY has been purified, and its biochemical and functional properties were characterized. ThnY was found to be a monomeric orange-brown iron-sulfur flavoprotein (estimated mass of 37,000 Da) containing one non-covalently attached flavin adenine dinucleotide and one plant type ferredoxin 2Fe-2S cluster. It can be efficiently reduced by dithionite, but reduction by pyridine nucleotides was very poor. Consistently, ThnY-dependent reduction of cytochrome c, ferricyanide, or 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol using NAD(P)H as the electron donor was undetectable or very weak. The addition of ThnY to electrophoretic mobility shift assays containing ThnR and a probe bearing two thn divergent promoters resulted in a 3-fold increase in protein-DNA complex formation affinity, which indicates that ThnY directly promotes thn transcription activation by ThnR.', 21077224: 'We report the synthesis and characterization of a polysaccharide crosslinker of tetraaniline grafting oxidized sodium alginate with large aldehyde and carboxylic groups. We demonstrate that this copolymer has the following properties: it is water soluble under any pH, biodegradable, electroactive, and noncytotoxic; it can self-assemble into nanoparticles with large active functional groups on the outer surface; it can crosslink materials with amino and aminoderivative groups like gelatin to form hydrogels, and thus the electroactivity is readily introduced to the materials. This copolymer has potential applications in biomedical fields such as tissue engineering, drug delivery, and nerve probes where electroactivity is required.', 21087842: 'Cardiovascular magnesium-based stents have been already applied in patients. However, their high corrosion rate hinders their clinical application. In this study, we adopt a new approach in the design of a Mg-based stent to improve the biodegradation rate and the drug release rate. By fabricating a micro-arc oxidation/poly-l-lactic acid (MAO/PLLA) composite coating on the magnesium alloy AZ81 substrate, the corrosion resistance decreased and the biodegradation rate became controllable. The drug release coating was composed of one Poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide)/paclitaxel (PLGA/PTX) layer and one pure PLGA blank layer without paclitaxel, and this coating also functions to provide controlled biodegradation rate of the stent. The drug release rate was controlled by controlling the ratio of the LA:GA of the PLGA without PTX. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were used to demonstrate the morphology of the samples before and after this modification. The blood compatibility of the samples was demonstrated by the platelet adhesion test. The drug release was determined by ultraviolet-visible (UV-visible) spectrophotometer. The result showed that the PLLA effectively sealed the micro-cracks and micro-holes on the surface of the MAO coating to give controllable biodegradation of the AZ81. The drug release rate of PTX exhibited a nearly linear sustained-release profile with no significant burst releases that would come from the uncontrolled oxidation/corrosion of AZ81. The samples modified had better hemocompatibility than 316L stainless steel.', 21095246: 'Two series of poly(ether-ester)-based bis-functional macromers terminated with acrylate groups and a well-defined number of ester bonds were synthesized. One series had a chain of 1, 3 or 5 ester bonds at both ends of the central poly(ethylene glycol) block (molecular weight, about 1000), while the other had an alternating structure of oligo(ethylene glycol) each of them linked to two ester bonds, in which 6 or 10 ester bonds were incorporated equally in the macromer molecules and the total molecular weight was adjusted by about 1000. Irradiation of all poly(ether-ester) macromers mixed with camphorquinone resulted in the formation of gels. Gel yield increased and hydrophilic properties of the gels produced decreased with irradiation time. The elastic modulus of the gels decreased with the number of ester bonds. Upon incubation in a PBS solution (pH 8.04), all gels were gradually degraded with time. At 3 weeks of incubation, the degradation ratio increased linearly with the number of ester bonds per unit of molecular weight of the macromers. The order of in vivo degradation rates determined from weight loss was similar to that of the in vitro study. Thus, these poly(ether-ester) macromers may be useful for biodegradable biomaterials or tissue engineering scaffolds.', 21113668: 'A 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (2,3-DHBP) dioxygenase gene from a Rhodococcus sp. strain, named RrbphCI and involved in the degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), was synthesized. RrbphCI was expressed in Escherichia coli and its encoded enzyme was purified. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the size of the protein encoded by RrbphCI was about 32 kDa. The activity of the 2,3-DHBP dioxygenase was 82.8 U/mg when the substrate was 2,3-DHBP, with optimum pH 8.0 at 30°C, and optimum temperature was 40°C at pH 8.0. The RrbphCI gene was transformed into Pseudomonas putida strain EG11, to determine the ability of the enzyme to degrade 2,3-DHBP. The wild type EG11 degraded 61.86% of supplied 2,3-DHBP and the transformed EG11 (hosting the RrbphCI gene) utilized 52.68% after 2 min of treatment at 30°C. The overexpressed and purified enzyme was able to degrade 2,3-DHBP. The 2,3-DHBP dioxygenase is a key enzyme in the PCB degradation pathway. RrbphCI and its encoded 2,3-DHBP dioxygenase may have transgenic applications in bioremediation of PCBs.', 21130906: \"Cartilage tissue engineering (TE) typically involves the combination of a 3-D biodegradable polymeric support material, with primary chondrocytes or other cell types able to differentiate into chondrocytes. The culture environment in which cell-material constructs are created and stored is an important factor. Various bioreactors have been introduced in TE approaches to provide specific culturing environments that might promote and accelerate cells' potential for chondrogenic differentiation and enhance the production of cartilage extracellular matrix. The aim of the present study was to investigate the chondrogenic differentiation of goat bone marrow cells (GBMCs) under flow perfusion culture conditions. For that purpose, GBMCs were seeded into starch-polycaprolactone fiber mesh scaffolds and cultured in a flow perfusion bioreactor for up to 28 days using culture medium supplemented with transforming growth factor-β1. The tissue-engineered constructs were characterized after several end points (7, 14, 21 and 28 days) by histological staining and immunocytochemistry analysis, as well as by glycosaminoglycan and alkaline phosphatase quantification assays. In addition, the expression of typical chondrogenic markers was assessed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. In general, the results obtained suggest that a flow perfusion microenvironment favors the chondrogenic potential of GBMCs.\", 21131017: 'The impacts of bisphenol A- imprinted polymeric microspheres (MIPMs) on the biodegradation of bisphenol A by acclimated activated sludge were studied. Due to the selective adsorption of MIPMs to bisphenol A (BPA) and its analogues, addition of MIPMs to activated sludge increased levels of BPA and its metabolites, which were also the substrates of biodegradation. Higher substrates (BPA and its metabolites) level promoted biodegradation efficiencies of activated sludge via accelerating removal speed of BPA and its metabolites, increasing degradation rate and decreasing half-lives of biodegradation. The enhancement of MIPMs in degradation efficiencies was more significant in environmental water containing low-level of pollutants, and water containing interferences such as heavy metals and humic acid. Furthermore, MIPMs were more suitable than non-selective sorbents such as active carbon to be used as enhancer for BPA biodegradation. MIPMs combined with activated sludge are simple, effective, environmental-friendly processes to biodegrade low-level pollutants in environmental water.', 21166273: 'Phytoextraction has received increasing attention as a promising, cost-effective alternative to conventional engineering-based remediation methods for metal contaminated soils. In order to enhance the phytoremediative ability of green plants chelating agents are commonly used. Our study aims to evaluate whether, citric acid (CA) or elemental sulfur (S) should be used as an alternative to the ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)for chemically enhanced phytoextraction. Results showed that EDTA was more efficient than CA and S in solubilizing lead (Pb) from the soil. The application of EDTA and S increased the shoot biomass of wheat. However, application of CA at higher rates (30 mmol kg(-1)) resulted in significantly lower wheat biomass. Photosynthesis and transpiration rates increased with EDTA and S application, whereas these parameters were decreased with the application of CA. Elemental sulfur was ineffective for enhancing the concentration of Pb in wheat shoots. Although CA did not increase the Pb solubility measured at the end of experiment, however, it was more effective than EDTA in enhancing the concentration of Pb in the shoots of Triticum aestivum L. It was assumed that increase in Mn concentration to toxic levels in soil with CA addition might have resulted in unusual Pb concentration in wheat plants. The results of the present study suggest that under the conditions used in this experiment, CA at the highest dose was the best amendment for enhanced phytoextraction of Pb using wheat compared to either EDTA or S.', 21166291: 'The popular ornamental plant Calendula officinalis L was studied for its potential application in the phytoremediation of cadmium (Cd)-contaminated soils. Enhancements to the Cd accumulation by the application of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (EDTA) and ethylenegluatarotriacetic acid (EGTA) to the soil were investigated. Under these chemically enhanced treatments, EDTA was observed to be toxic to the plants leading to retarded growth. However, the application of SDS and/or EGTA was shown to result in significantly increased plant biomass (p < 0.05). Most of the chemical treatments resulted in increases to the shoot and root Cd concentrations, with the root Cd concentration being consistently higher than that shoot Cd concentration. Almost all of the investigated chemical treatments containing SDS or and EGTA were shown to lead to an increase in the total Cd content in the plants (p < 0.05). The application of EGTA alone led to an observed total Cd increase of up to 217%. This investigation revealed considerable efficiency of chemical enhancement and correspondingly increased potential of Calendula officinalis L. for applications of phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated sites.', 21166292: 'A field experiment was conducted to study the effects of inoculation with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus caledonium and/or Rhizobium meliloti on phytoremediation of an agricultural soil contaminated with weathered PCBs by alfalfa grown for 180 days. Planting alfalfa (P), alfalfa inoculated with G. caledonium (P + AM), alfalfa inoculated with R. meliloti (P + R), and alfalfa co-inoculated with R. meliloti and G. caledonium (P+AM+R) decreased significantly initial soil PCB concentrations by 8.1, 12.0, 33.8, and 43.5%, respectively. Inoculation with R. meliloti and/or G. caledonium (P+AM+R) increased the yield of alfalfa, and the accumulation of PCBs in the shoots. Soil microbial counts and the carbon utilization ability of the soil microbial community increased when alfalfa was inoculated with R. meliloti and/or G. caledonium. Results of this field study suggest that synergistic interactions between AMF and Rhizobium may have great potential to enhance phytoremediation by alfalfa of an agricultural soil contaminated with weathered PCBs.', 21168535: 'Growth, differentiation and migration factors facilitate the engineering of tissues but need to be administered with defined gradients over a prolonged period of time. In this study insulin as a growth factor for cartilage tissue engineering and a biodegradable PLGA delivery device were used. The aim was to investigate comparatively three different microencapsulation techniques, solid-in-oil-in-water (s/o/w), water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) and oil-in-oil-in-water (o/o/w), for the fabrication of insulin-loaded PLGA microspheres with regard to protein loading efficiency, release and degradation kinetics, biological activity of the released protein and phagocytosis of the microspheres. Insulin-loaded PLGA microspheres prepared by all three emulsification techniques had smooth and spherical surfaces with a negative zeta potential. The preparation technique did not affect particle degradation nor induce phagocytosis by human leukocytes. The delivery of structurally intact and biologically active insulin from the microspheres was shown using circular dichroism spectroscopy and a MCF7 cell-based proliferation assay. However, the insulin loading efficiency (w/o/w about 80%, s/o/w 60%, and o/o/w 25%) and the insulin release kinetics were influenced by the microencapsulation technique. The results demonstrate that the w/o/w microspheres are most appropriate, providing a high encapsulation efficiency and low initial burst release, and thus these were finally used for cartilage tissue engineering. Insulin released from w/o/w PLGA microspheres stimulated the formation of cartilage considerably in chondrocyte high density pellet cultures, as determined by increased secretion of proteoglycans and collagen type II. Our results should encourage further studies applying protein-loaded PLGA microspheres in combination with cell transplants or cell-free in situ tissue engineering implants to regenerate cartilage.', 21171163: 'There remains a great need for vascular substitutes for small-diameter applications. The use of an elastomeric biodegradable material, enabling acute antithrombogenicity and long-term in vivo remodeling, could be beneficial for this purpose. Conduits (1.3 mm internal diameter) were obtained by electrospinning biodegradable poly(ester urethane)urea (PEUU), and by luminally immobilizing a non-thrombogenic, 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) copolymer. Platelet adhesion was characterized in vitro after contact with ovine blood. The conduits were implanted as aortic interposition grafts in the rat for 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. Surface treatment resulted in a 10-fold decrease in platelet adhesion compared to untreated material. Patency at 8 weeks was 92% for the coated grafts compared to 40% for the non-coated grafts. Histology at 8 and 12 weeks demonstrated formation of cellularized neotissue consisting of aligned collagen and elastin. The lumen of the grafts was confluent with cells qualitatively aligned in the direction of blood flow. Immunohistochemistry suggested the presence of smooth muscle cells in the medial layer of the neotissue and endothelial cells lining the lumen. Mechanically, the grafts were less compliant than rat aortas prior to implantation (4.5 ± 2.0 × 10(-4) mmHg(-1) vs. 14.2 ± 1.1 × 10(-4) mmHg(-1) , respectively), then after 4 weeks in vivo they approximated native values, but subsequently became stiffer again at later time points. The novel coated grafts exhibited promising antithrombogenic and mechanical properties for small-diameter arterial revascularization. Further evaluation in vivo will be required to demonstrate complete remodeling of the graft into a native-like artery.', 21183198: 'The development of innovative water disinfection strategies is of utmost importance to prevent outbreaks of waterborne diseases related to poor treatment of (drinking) water. Recently, the association of silver nanoparticles with the bacterial cell surface of Lactobacillus fermentum (referred to as biogenic silver or bio-Ag(0)) has been reported to exhibit antiviral properties. The microscale bacterial carrier matrix serves as a scaffold for Ag(0) particles, preventing aggregation during encapsulation. In this study, bio-Ag(0) was immobilized in different microporous PVDF membranes using two different pre-treatments of bio-Ag(0) and the immersion-precipitation method. Inactivation of UZ1 bacteriophages using these membranes was successfully demonstrated and was most probably related to the slow release of Ag(+) from the membranes. At least a 3.4 log decrease of viruses was achieved by application of a membrane containing 2500 mg bio-Ag(0)(powder) m(-2) in a submerged plate membrane reactor operated at a flux of 3.1 L m(-2) h(-1). Upon startup, the silver concentration in the effluent initially increased to 271 μg L(-1) but after filtration of 31 L m(-2), the concentration approached the drinking water limit ( = 100 μg L(-1)). A virus decline of more than 3 log was achieved at a membrane flux of 75 L m(-2) h(-1), showing the potential of this membrane technology for water disinfection on small scale.', 21185620: 'A simplified method is used to assess the microbial activity of subsoils and soils across a broad geographic scale. Acetate was selected because it is a major intermediate in catabolic biochemical pathways. In order to get minimal disturbance, only a small amount of tritium labelled acetate and water is added to the subsoil material. After an incubation time, the subsoil material is separated from the water by centrifugation and the formed tritium labelled water is separated from the remaining acetate by evaporation. The data of 128 locations in the Netherlands were plotted in a soil map and were also compared with the depth, dry weight, electric conductivity, pH and nitrate concentration. The peat areas consisted of limed meadows with a high groundwater level whereas the sand areas often showed deeper groundwater levels and a lower pH. The subsoils at the groundwater table of the peat areas, which are in contact with soil air, showed a higher mineralization rate compared with the surface soils in our study. In contrast, the mineralization rate of the subsoil at the groundwater table of sandy soils showed on average a factor 30 lower rate. Nevertheless, the self purification capacity of the subsoil can be vital under weather conditions where the surface soil becomes less active.', 21186041: 'Transformation of the pharmaceutical oxcarbazepine (OXC), a keto analogue of carbamazepine (CBZ) was investigated under different water disinfection processes (ozonation, chlorination and UV irradiation) to compare its persistence, toxicity and degradation pathways with those of CBZ. Analysis by LC-ion trap-MS(n) allowed for the identification of up to thirteen transformation products (TPs). The major abundant and persistent TPs (10,11-dihydro-10,11-trans-dihydroxy-carbamazepine (DiOH-CBZ), acridine (ACIN) and 1-(2-benzaldehyde)-(1H, 3H)-quinazoline-2,4-dione (BQD)) were identical to those previously reported during water treatment of CBZ. Only one new compound arising from an intramolecular cyclisation reaction was identified during UV irradiation. OXC reacted quickly with hydroxyl radical and relatively rapidly with free chlorine while slow reaction rates were recorded in presence of ozone and upon UV irradiation. An increase of the acute toxicity of UV irradiated solutions, monitored by a Daphnia magna bioassay, was recorded, probably due to the accumulation of ACIN. The formation of ACIN is of concern due to the carcinogenic properties of this chemical. ACIN was also generated during the direct UV photo transformation of DiOH-CBZ and 10-hydroxy-10,11-dihydro-carbamazepine (OH-CBZ), two metabolites of OXC and CBZ widely detected in water resources. Analysis of tap water samples revealed the occurrence at ng/L levels of the major TPs detected under laboratory scale experiments, except ACIN.', 21187171: 'The synthesis of a new family of biodegradable α-amino acid poly(ester amide)s (AA-PEAs) with pendant benzyl ether groups and hydroxyl functional groups is reported. The synthetic strategy employs the ring opening reaction of O-benzyl-L-serine-N-carboxyanhydride with di-p-toluenesulfonic acid salts of bis-L-valine butane-1,4-diester, followed by solution polycondesation reactions with di-p-nitrophenyl sebacate in N,N-dimethylacetamide. Catalytic hydrogenation of the resulting benzyl ether protected AA-PEAs (PEA-Ser-Bzs) was performed to restore the hydroxyl functional groups in the functionalized AA-PEAs (PEA-Ser-OH). All resulting polymers were characterized by standard physico-chemical methods. The pendant hydroxyl groups in PEA-Ser-OH were used to fabricate AA-PEA-based gels via acrylation and photo-gelation. The cell-polymer interactions of PEA-Ser-Bz and PEA-Ser-OH were evaluated in terms of cell attachment and proliferation assay using bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) as well as fibroblasts. The cell culture data indicated that the hydrophobic/hydrophilic characteristics (from contact angle data) of these AA-PEAs could significantly affect the interaction between BAECs and AA-PEA. This finding may provide additional possible applications for this new family of functionalized AA-PEA polymers.', 21196117: 'This study compared the effect of four pure carbon supplements on biological denitrification to a liquor derived as a by-product from the wet oxidation (WO) of waste activated sludge. Sequencing batch reactors were used to acclimate sludge biomass, which was used in batch assays. Acetate, WO liquor and ethanol-supplementation generated the fastest denitrification rates. Acetate and WO liquor were efficiently utilised by all acclimated biomass types, while poor rates were achieved with methanol and formate. When comparing an inoculum from an ethanol-supplemented and non-supplemented wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), the ethanol-acclimated sludge obtained superior denitrification rates when supplemented with ethanol. Similarly high nitrate removal rates were achieved with both sludge types with acetate and WO liquor supplementation, indicating that WO liquors could achieve excellent rates of nitrate removal. The performance of the WO liquor was attributed to the variety of organic carbon substrates (particularly acetic acid) present within the liquor.', 21208798: 'The effects of rhamnolipids produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC9027 on the cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) and the biodegradation of phenanthrene by two thermophilic bacteria, Bacillus subtilis BUM and P. aeruginosa P-CG3, and mixed inoculation of these two strains were investigated. Rhamnolipids significantly reduced the CSH of the hydrophobic BUM and resulted in a noticeable lag period in the biodegradation. However, they significantly increased the CSH and enhanced the biodegradation for the hydrophilic P-CG3. In the absence of rhamnolipids, a mixed inoculation of BUM and P-CG3 removed 82.2% of phenanthrene within 30 days and the major contributor of the biodegradation was BUM (rapid degrader) while the growth of P-CG3 (slow degrader) was suppressed. Addition of rhamnolipids promoted the surfactant-mediated-uptake of phenanthrene by P-CG3 but inhibited the uptake through direct contact by BUM. This resulted in the domination of P-CG3 during the initial stage of biodegradation and enhanced the biodegradation to 92.7%.', 21216096: \"The aim of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of three chemical oxidation processes for increasing the biodegradability of aqueous diethanolamine solutions (aqueous DEA solutions), to be used as pre-treatments before a biological process. The raw aqueous DEA solution, sourced from a sour gas sweetening plant at a Mexican oil refinery, was first characterized by standardized physico-chemical methods. Then experiments were conducted on diluted aqueous DEA solutions to test the effects of Fenton's reagent, ozone and ozone-hydrogen peroxide on the removal of some physicochemical parameters of these solutions. Lastly, biodegradability tests based on Dissolved Organic Carbon Die Away OECD301-A, were carried out on a dilution of the raw aqueous DEA solution and on the treated aqueous DEA solutions, produced by applying the best experimental conditions determined during the aforementioned oxidation tests. Experimental results showed that for aqueous DEA solutions treated with Fenton's reagent, the best degradation rate (70%) was obtained at pH 2.8, with Fe(2+) and H(2)O(2) at doses of 1000 and 10,000 mg/L respectively. In the ozone process, the best degradation (60%) was observed in aqueous DEA solution (100 mg COD/L), using 100 mg O(3)/L at pH 5. In the ozone-hydrogen peroxide process, no COD or DOC removals were observed. The diluted spent diethanolamine solution showed its greatest increase in biodegradability after a reaction period of 28 days when treated with Fenton's reagent, but after only 15 days in the case of ozonation.\", 21232782: 'Nano-scale zero-valent iron (NZVI) particles are increasingly used to remediate aquifers contaminated with hazardous oxidized pollutants such as trichloroethylene (TCE). However, the high reduction potential of NZVI can result in toxicity to indigenous bacteria and hinder their participation in the cleanup process. Here, we report on the mitigation of the bactericidal activity of NZVI towards gram-negative Escherichia coli and gram-positive Bacillus subtilis in the presence of Suwannee River humic acids (SRHA), which were used as a model for natural organic matter (NOM). B. subtilis was more tolerant to NZVI (1 g/L) than E. coli in aerobic bicarbonate-buffered medium. SRHA (10 mg/L) significantly mitigated toxicity, and survival rates after 4 h exposure increased to similar levels observed for controls not exposed to NZVI. TEM images showed that the surface of NZVI and E. coli was surrounded by a visible floccus. This decreased the zeta potential of NZVI from -30 to -45 mV and apparently exerted electrosteric hindrance to minimize direct contact with bacteria, which mitigated toxicity. H(2) production during anaerobic NZVI corrosion was not significantly hindered by SRHA (p > 0.05), However, NZVI reactivity towards TCE (20 mg/L), assessed by the first-order dechlorination rate coefficient, decreased by 23%. Overall, these results suggest that the presence of NOM offers a tradeoff for NZVI-based remediation, with higher potential for concurrent or sequential bioremediation at the expense of partially inhibited abiotic reactivity with the target contaminant (TCE).', 21232935: 'Before switching totally to alternative fuel stage, CO(2) mitigation process has considered a transitional strategy for combustion of fossil fuels inevitably. In comparison to other CO(2) mitigation options, such as oceanic or geologic injection, the biological photosynthetic process would present a far superior and sustainable solution under both environmental and social considerations. The utilization of the cyanobacteria Anabaena sp. CH1 in carbon dioxide mitigation processes is analyzed in our research. It was found that an original developed photobioreactor with internal light source exhibits high light utilization. Anabaena sp. CH1 demonstrates excellent CO(2) tolerance even at 15% CO(2) level. This enables flue gas from power plant to be directly introduced to Anabaena sp. CH1 culture. Double light intensity and increased 47% CO(2) bubble retention time could enhance CO(2) removal efficiencies by 79% and 67%, respectively. A maximum CO(2) fixation rate of 1.01 g CO(2)L(-1)day(-1) was measured experimentally.', 21251818: 'The main objective of this work was to determine the effectiveness of various biofouling reducers (BFRs) to operational condition in hybrid membrane bioreactor (MBR) of palm oil mill effluent (POME). A series of tests involving three bench scale (100 L) hybrid MBR were operated at sludge retention times (SRTs) of 30 days with biofouling reducer (BFR). Three different biofouling reducers (BFRs) were powdered actived carbon (PAC), zeolite (Ze), and Moringa oleifera (Mo) with doses of 4, 8 and 12 g L(-1) respectively were used. Short-term filtration trials and critical flux tests were conducted. Results showed that, all BFRs successfully removed soluble microbial products (SMP), for PAC, Ze, and Mo at 58%, 42%, and 48%, respectively. At their optimum dosages, PAC provided above 70% reductions and 85% in fouling rates during the short-term filtration and critical flux tests.', 21252001: 'Biodegradable hydrogels have been studied extensively in recent years for biomedical applications, including tissue engineering and drug delivery, due to their tunable properties and similarities to natural soft tissue. In this work, two poly(β-amino ester) biodegradable hydrogel systems were synthesised and studied in vitro. Different degradation profiles were observed, ranging from 7 h to 4 months, and the compressive modulus was shown to decrease as degradation proceeded. MTT cytotoxicity analysis was used to analyze the cellular response to the degradation products, and the hydrogel systems exhibited similar toxicity to poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) degradation products. Finally, cell attachment was studied by seeding pluripotent mesenchymal cells directly onto the hydrogel surfaces followed by a live/dead assay and fluorescent imaging. Cells showed significant viability at 24h (98%) and slightly lower, but still substantial viability, at 48 h (72%). These hydrogels exhibited a range of properties and favorable cellular responses, all which indicate that these materials could be viable materials for tissue regeneration and other biomedical applications.', 21252436: 'Chlorinated phenolic compounds like 4-monochlorophenol (4CP) are characterized by high toxicity even at relatively low concentrations and by strong persistency in both water and soils. Since cometabolism was proved to enhance 4CP biological removal, a conventional Sequencing Batch Reactor (SBR) was used in this study for the cometabolic aerobic degradation of 4CP at different influent concentrations and volumetric organic loading rates (40-50 mg/L and 0.129-0.323 kgCOD-4CP/m3·d, respectively), with sodium acetate (NaAc) as the growth substrate. The effects of different 4CP/NaAc ratios on SBR performances were evaluated in terms of 4CP removal efficiencies and maximum specific removal rates in order to maximize reactor performances: a decrease in NaAc dosage as external growth substrate would lead to definitely lower operating costs. A positive correlation was observed between 4CP maximum specific removal rates and the applied 4CP/NaAc ratios, thus making further reduction in NaAc dosage possible.', 21254383: 'The natural polymers chitosan and alginate represent an attractive material choice for biodegradable inplants. These were used as coating materials to make positively and negatively charged PLGA nanoparticles, respectively. After blending at total solids concentration >10% wt/vol, these oppositely charged nanoparticles yielded a cohesive colloidal gel. Electrostatic forces between oppositely charged nanoparticles produced a stable 3D porous network that may be extruded or molded to the desired shape. This high concentration colloidal system demonstrated shear-thinning behavior due to the disruption of interparticle interactions. Once the external force was removed, the cohesive property of the colloidal gel was recovered. Scanning electron micrographs of dried colloidal networks revealed an organized, 3D microporous structure. Rheological studies were employed to probe the differences in plasticity and shear sensitivity of colloidal gels. Viability tests of hUCMSCs seeded on the colloidal gels also demonstrated the negligible cytotoxicity of the materials. All the results indicated the potential application of the biodegradable colloidal gels as an injectable scaffold in tissue engineering and drug release.', 21279894: 'The efficiency of 2 common types sludge, activated sludge and digesting sludge, to biodegrade ethinylestradiol (EE2) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and the impacts of EE2 on microbial community structure were investigated. The results showed that 75%-88% EE2 were removed under aerobic conditions and the values were 75%-84% under anaerobic conditions. The diversity of microbial species in the tested sludge decreased when exposed to EE2 and the shift of microbial community structures was dependent on both sludge types and process conditions. Predominant bacteria were identified as Proteobacteria class which was considered to have EE2 degradation capacities. Twelve strains were found, 8 of them belonged to the Class of γ-proteobacterium, 1 of β-proteobacterium, 1 of Actinobacterium, and 2 of unclassified strains.', 21296413: 'A family of injectable and thermosensitive hydrogels suitable for myocardial injection was developed to deliver cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs), an emerging and promising cell type for cardiac cell therapy. The hydrogels were based on polycaprolactone, N-isopropylacrylamide, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and dimethyl-γ-butyrolactone acrylate. Atom transfer radical polymerization was used to synthesize hydrogels with a well-defined structure and well-controlled properties. The hydrogel solutions possessed thermal transition temperatures around room temperature and exhibited injectability suitable for myocardial injection. At 37\\xa0°C, the hydrogel solutions were capable of forming solid gels within 5s. This would allow the hydrogels to largely retain in the heart during injection. The hydrogels were highly flexible at body temperature with moduli matching those of the rat and human myocardium, and breaking strains higher than those of the myocardium, enabling them to respond synchronically with heart motion. The well-controlled polymer structure allowed for precisely controlling and decoupling water content and stiffness that affect cell differentiation. DNA assay demonstrated that CDCs proliferated in the 3D hydrogels during a 2-week culture period. CDCs maintained their colony formation capability in the hydrogel. Interestingly, hydrogels directed CDCs differentiation into mature cardiac lineage. At mRNA level, the mature cardiac specific transcript factors cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac myosin heavy chain (MYH6) were up-regulated, while the pre-mature cardiac marker GATA4 was down-regulated even after 1 day of encapsulation. CDC differentiation was interplayed by hydrogel stiffness and collagen in the hydrogel. Hydrogel with modulus ∼31\\xa0kPa was found to more significantly up-regulate cardiac expression than that with modulus ∼5 or ∼63\\xa0kPa. cTnT expression was largely regulated by both stiffness and collagen while MYH6 was mainly regulated by stiffness. Immunohistochemistry study showed that CDCs expressed cardiac troponin I and MYH6 proteins after 2 weeks of culture. These results demonstrate that the thermosensitive hydrogels not only possess physical properties suitable for myocardial injection, but also promote CDC proliferation and cardiac differentiation. These hydrogels represent potential candidates for delivery of CDCs into infarcted hearts.', 21310479: 'A series of block poly(ester-urethane)s (abbreviated as PU3/4HB) based on biodegradable poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate) (P3/4HB) segments were synthesized by a facile way of melting polymerization using 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) as the coupling agent and stannous octanoate (Sn(Oct)(2)) as catalyst, with different 4HB contents and segment lengths. The chemical structure, molecular weight and distribution were systematically characterized by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum (NMR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The thermal property was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The hydrophilicity was investigated by static contact angle of deionized water and CH(2)I(2). DSC curves revealed that the PU3/4HB polyurethanes have their T(g) from -25.6\\xa0°C to -4.3\\xa0°C, and crystallinity from 2.5% to 25.3%, being almost amorphous to semi-crystalline. The obtained PU3/4HBs are hydrophobic (water contact angle 77.4°-95.9°), and their surface free energy (SFE) were studied. The morphology of platelets adhered on the polyurethane film observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that platelets were activated on the PU3/4HB films which would lead to blood coagulation. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay revealed that the PU3/4HBs displayed higher platelet adhesion property than raw materials and biodegradable polymer polylactic acid (PLA) and would be potential hemostatic materials. Crystallinity degree, hydrophobicity, surface free energy and urethane linkage content play important roles in affecting the LDH activity and hence the platelet adhesion. CCK-8 assay showed that the PU3/4HB is non-toxic and well for cell growth and proliferation of mouse fibroblast L929. It showed that the hydrophobicity is an important factor for cell growth while 3HB content of the PU3/4HB is important for the cell proliferation. Through changing the composition and the chain-length of P3/4HB-diol prepolymers, the biocompatibility of the poly(ester-urethane)s can be tailored.', 21320751: 'Research on the phytoextraction of Cr from contaminated soils has been scarce, because very few plant species have been reported to accumulate Cr to high concentrations in their aerial parts. In this study, a Cr-hyperaccumulator, Leersia hexandra was investigated for its potential to remove Cr from the soil in a series of pot experiments. The results showed that L. hexandra had a high extraction capacity for chromium in soil, with the highest Cr concentration in shoot of 1844 mg/kg. Model calculation based on the negative linear relationship between the bioconcentration factors (BCF) and the concentrations of soil Cr indicated that phytoremediation using L. hexandra was feasible when soil was only moderately contaminated with Cr. Three sequential harvests did not significantly alter Cr accumulation and shoot biomass (p > 0.05), indicating that sequential harvest might be an available and convenient way to achieve the decontamination of Cr-contaminated soils by L. hexandra. On average, fertilization increased the shoot biomass by 45% and the total amount of extracted-Cr by 26%, suggesting that fertilization is able to enhance Cr phytoextraction of L. hexandra. Although EDTA increased the concentrations of Cr in shoots by 1.4 times, it also resulted in low plant biomass, thereby decreasing the amount of Cr accumulation.', 21324508: 'In the present study surfactant addition with the help of either a mechanical dispersion or a thermal treatment was applied in order to increase the solubility and the bioavailability of phenanthrene in aqueous media, and therefore to promote its biodegradation. Among four tested surfactants (Tween 80, Brij 30, sodium dodecyl sulphate and rhamnolipids), Brij 30 (0.5 gL(-1)) showed the best results allowing us to attain about 20 mgL(-1) of soluble phenanthrene. An additional thermal treatment at 60°C for 24h, 200 rpm permitted to increase the solubility of phenanthrene in the presence of Brij 30 (0.5 gL(-1)) to about 30 mgL(-1). Higher dispersions of phenanthrene particles as well as the reduction of their size were obtained using Ultra-Turrax and French press. The biodegradation of phenanthrene by Pseudomonas putida was then investigated. The reduction of size of phenanthrene particles by mechanical dispersion did not influence its biodegradation, suggesting that P. putida consumed only soluble phenanthrene. The addition of Brij 30 (0.5 gL(-1)) permitted to obtain more phenanthrene metabolized. The use of Brij 30 coupled with a transitory heating of phenanthrene-containing medium at 60°C led to an even more complete biodegradation. This might be a promising way to enhance biodegradation of PAHs.', 21330709: 'Enhanced phosphate removal from wastewaters is dependent on the synthesis and intracellular accumulation of polyphosphate by sludge microorganisms. However the role played by polyphosphate in microbial metabolism and the factors that trigger its formation remain poorly-understood. Many examples of the accumulation of the biopolymer by environmental microorganisms are documented; these include a recent report of the presence of large polyphosphate inclusions in sulfur-oxidizing marine bacteria. To investigate whether any link might exist outside the marine environment between the presence of reduced sulfur compounds and enhanced levels of microbial phosphate uptake and polyphosphate accumulation, activated sludge cultures were grown under laboratory conditions in media that contained sulfite, thiosulfate, hydrosulfite or tetrathionate. Only in the presence of sulfite was there any evidence of a stimulatory effect; in medium that contained 0.5 mM sodium sulfite some 17% more phosphate was removed by the sludge, whilst there was an almost two-fold increase in intracellular polyphosphate levels. No indications of sulfite toxicity were observed.', 21368207: 'Harmful algal blooms (HABs) cause significant economic and ecological damage worldwide. Despite considerable efforts, a comprehensive understanding of the factors that promote these blooms has been lacking, because the biochemical pathways that facilitate their dominance relative to other phytoplankton within specific environments have not been identified. Here, biogeochemical measurements showed that the harmful alga Aureococcus anophagefferens outcompeted co-occurring phytoplankton in estuaries with elevated levels of dissolved organic matter and turbidity and low levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen. We subsequently sequenced the genome of A. anophagefferens and compared its gene complement with those of six competing phytoplankton species identified through metaproteomics. Using an ecogenomic approach, we specifically focused on gene sets that may facilitate dominance within the environmental conditions present during blooms. A. anophagefferens possesses a larger genome (56 Mbp) and has more genes involved in light harvesting, organic carbon and nitrogen use, and encoding selenium- and metal-requiring enzymes than competing phytoplankton. Genes for the synthesis of microbial deterrents likely permit the proliferation of this species, with reduced mortality losses during blooms. Collectively, these findings suggest that anthropogenic activities resulting in elevated levels of turbidity, organic matter, and metals have opened a niche within coastal ecosystems that ideally suits the unique genetic capacity of A. anophagefferens and thus, has facilitated the proliferation of this and potentially other HABs.', 21375290: 'The influence of the nonionic surfactant Brij 35 on biodegradation of slowly desorbing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was determined in contaminated soils. We employed a soil originated from a creosote-polluted site, and a manufactured gas plant soil that had been treated by bioremediation. The two soils differed in their total content in five indicator 3-, 4-, and 5-ring PAHs (2923 mg kg(-1) and 183 mg kg(-1) in the creosote-polluted and bioremediated soils, respectively) but had a similar content (140 mg kg(-1) vs 156 mg kg(-1)) of slowly desorbing PAHs. The PAHs present in the bioremediated soil were highly recalcitrant. The surfactant at a concentration above its critical micelle concentration enhanced the biodegradation of slowly desorbing PAHs in suspensions of both soils, but it was especially efficient with bioremediated soil, causing a 62% loss of the total PAH content. An inhibition of biodegradation was observed with the high-molecular-weight PAHs pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene in the untreated soil, possibly due to competition effects with other solubilized PAHs present at relatively high concentrations. We suggest that nonionic surfactants may improve bioremediation performance with soils that have previously undergone extensive bioremediation to enrich for a slowly desorbing profile.', 21417712: 'The implantation of tissue-engineered constructs leads to hypoxic and physical stress to the seeded cells until they were reached by a functional microvascular system. Preconditioning of cells with heat shock induced heat shock proteins, which can support the cells to survive a subsequent episode of stress that would otherwise be lethal. Preconditioning of tissue-engineered constructs resulted in significantly higher number of surviving osteoblast-like cells (OLC). At the 6th and 10th day, angiogenic response was found comparative to poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffolds vitalized with either unconditioned or preconditioned OLC. However, they were significantly enhanced compared with the nonvitalized collagen-labeled PLGA scaffolds. This study demonstrates that vitalization of PLGA scaffolds with OLC accelerates the angiogenic response induced by the surrounding host tissue. In addition, heat shock preconditioning significantly enhances the survival rate of the OLC that are seeded on these scaffolds. Thus, vitalization of substitutes with adequately pretreated OLC may promise biologically adequate osseous restorations.', 21423734: StringElement('Mercury-polluted environments are often contaminated with other heavy metals.

Methanol was introduced to improve anaerobic biodegradability of real coal gasification wastewater, and the effect of methanol addition on the performance was investigated in a mesophilic upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactor with a hydraulic retention time of 24 hr. Experimental results indicated that anaerobic treatment of coal gasification wastewater was feasible with the addition of methanol. The corresponding maximum COD and phenol removal rates were 71% and 75%, respectively, with methanol concentration of 500 mg COD/L for a total organic loading rate of 3.5 kg COD/(m3 x day) and a phenol loading rate of 0.6 kg/(m3 x day). The phenol removal rate was not improved with a higher methanol concentration of 1000 mg COD/L. Substrate utilization rate (SUR) tests indicated that the SURs of phenol were 106, 132, and 83 mg phenol/(g VSS x day) at methanol concentrations of 250, 500, and 1000 mg COD/L, respectively, and only 45 mg phenol/(g VSS x day) in the control reactor. The presence of methanol could reduce the toxicity of coal gasification wastewater and increase the biodegradation of phenolic compounds.', 21465644: 'Biomaterials are becoming increasingly popular for use in spinal cord repair, but few studies have investigated their long-term biocompatibility in central nervous system tissue. In this study, chitosan was compared with two commercial materials, degradable polyglycolide (vicryl and polyglactin 910) and nondegradable expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (Gore-Tex and ePTFE), in terms of host tissue response and biodegradation in the rat spinal cord in two different spinal cord implantation models. In an uninjured model, implants were placed in the spinal cord intrathecal space for up to 6 months. At 1 month, vicryl implants elicited an elevated macrophage/microglia response compared to chitosan and Gore-Tex, which subsided in all groups by 6 months. Fibrous encapsulation was observed for all three materials. At 6 months, the in vivo degradation of vicryl was complete, while Gore-Tex showed no signs of degradation, as assessed by mass loss and SEM. Chitosan implants showed evidence of chain degradation at 6 months as demonstrated by differential hematoxylin and eosin staining; however, this did not result in mass loss. In the second model, implants were placed directly into the spinal cord for up to 12 months. This resulted in increased immune and inflammatory responses but did not alter degradation profiles. The same trends observed for the materials in the intrathecal space were mirrored in the spinal cord tissue. These results demonstrate that chitosan is a relatively inert biomaterial that does not elicit a chronic immune response and is suitable for long-term applications for repair of the spinal cord.', 21473279: 'The biological treatment of gaseous emissions of hydrophobic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) results in low rates of elimination partially because of the low solubility of VOCs in water. Recently, the use of two-phase partition bioreactors (TPPBs) was proposed to increase the bioavailability and consequently the elimination capacities of this kind of VOC. In the present study, TPPBs operating in a batch feed mode were tested for biodegradation of hexane and toluene vapours with a microbial consortium. The results obtained were compared with single-phase systems (control experiments). The liquid phase used was silicone oil (organic phase) with the surfactant Pluronic F-68. Experiments were named F1 and F2 for one and two phases, respectively, and F(1S) and F(2S) when the surfactant was included. The maximum specific rates (S(rates)) of hydrocarbon consumption for hexane and toluene were 539 and 773 mg(hydrocarbon)/(g(protein) x h), respectively. For both substrates, the systems that showed the highest S(rates) of hydrocarbon consumption were F2 and F(2S). In experiment F(1S) the surfactant Pluronic F-68 increased the solubility of hydrocarbons in the liquid phase, but did not increase the S(rates). The maximum percentages of mineralization were 51% and 72% for hexane and toluene, respectively. The results showed that simultaneous addition of silicone oil and surfactant favours the mineralization, but not the rate ofbiodegradation, of toluene and hexane vapours.', 21476351: 'To assess the potential endocrine disruptive effects through multiple nuclear receptors (NRs), especially non-steroidal NRs, in municipal wastewater, we examined the agonistic activities on four NRs (estrogen receptor alpha, thyroid hormone receptor alpha, retinoic acid receptor alpha and retinoid X receptor alpha) of untreated and treated wastewater from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Japan using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Investigation of the influent and effluent of seven WWTPs revealed that agonistic activities against steroidal and non-steroidal NRs were always detected in the influents and partially remained in the effluents. Further investigation of four WWTPs employing conventional activated sludge, pseudo-anoxic-oxic, anoxic-oxic and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic processes revealed that the ability to reduce the agonistic activity against each of the four NRs varies depending on the treatment process. These results indicated that municipal wastewater in Japan commonly contains endocrine disrupting chemicals that exert agonistic activities on steroidal and non-steroidal NRs, and that some of these chemicals are released into the natural aquatic environment. Although the results obtained in yeast assays suggested that measured levels of non-steroidal NR agonists in the effluent of WWTPs were not likely to cause any biological effect, further study is required to assess their possible risks in detail.', 21482429: 'A variety of antibiotics and their metabolites at sub-inhibitory level concentrations are suspected to expand resistance genes in the environment. However, knowledge is limited on the causal correlation of trace antibiotics or their metabolites with resistance proliferation. In this study, erythromycin (ERY) resistance genes were screened on microbial consortia of sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) after one year acclimation to ERY (100 μg/L) or dehydrated erythromycin (ERY-H(2)O, 50 μg/L). The identified esterase gene ereA explains that ERY could be degraded to six products by microbes acclimated to ERY (100 μg/L). However, ERY could not be degraded by microbes acclimated to ERY-H(2)O (50 μg/L), which may be due to the less proliferated ereA gene. Biodegradation of ERY required the presence of exogenous carbon source (e.g., glucose) and nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus) for assimilation, but overdosed ammonium-N (>40 mg/L) inhibited degradation of ERY. Zoogloea, a kind of biofilm formation bacteria, became predominant in the ERY degradation consortia, suggesting that the input of ERY could induce biofilm resistance to antibiotics. Our study highlights that lower μg/L level of ERY or ERY-H(2)O in the environment encourages expansion of resistance genes in microbes.', 21482463: 'This study deals with the decolorization of black liquor (BL) by isolated potential bacterial consortium comprising Serratia marcescens (GU193982), Citrobacter sp.

In this study, result revealed that the ligninolytic activities were found to be growth associated and the developed bacterial consortium was efficient for the reduction of COD, BOD and color up to 83%, 74% and 85%, respectively. The HPLC analysis of degraded samples of BL has shown the reduction in peak area compared to control. Further, the GC-MS analysis showed that, most of the compounds detected in control were diminished after bacterial treatment while, formic acid hydrazide, 4-cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, carbamic acid, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid and erythropentanoic acid were found as new metabolites.

With the increasing number of applications and uses of ENMs comes an increasing likelihood of nanoscale materials posing potential risks to the environment and engineered technical systems such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Recent scientific data suggests that ENMs that are useful in, for example, medical applications due to their novel physicochemical properties, may also cause adverse effects to the bacterial populations used in wastewater treatment systems. In this review, the toxicological effects of titanium nanoparticles (nTiO(2)), zinc oxide (nZnO), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), fullerenes (C(60)) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to bacteria were examined. The results suggest that the potential ENMs risks to bacteria are non-uniform (need to be assessed case-by-case), and are dependent on numerous factors (e.g. size, pH, surface area, natural organic matter). Currently available data are therefore insufficient for evaluating the risks that ENMs pose in WWTPs. To fill these knowledge gaps, we recommend scenario specific studies aimed at improving our understanding on: (i) estimated volumes of ENMs in effluents, (ii) the antibacterial sensitivity of cultures within WWTPs towards selected ENMs, and (iii) processes improving the stability of ENMs in solutions. Two factors that merit consideration for elucidating the potential risks systematically are the toxicity mechanisms of ENMs to bacteria, and the influencing factors based on inherent physicochemical properties and environmental factors. Furthermore, the complexity of behaviour and fate of ENMs in real WWTPs requires case studies for assessing the ENMs risks to bacteria in vivo. The current laboratory results derived using simplified exposure media do not reflect actual environmental conditions.', 21509933: 'Polyamidoamines (PAAs) are a well-known family of synthetic biocompatible and biodegradable polymers, which can be prepared as soft hydrogels characterized by low interfacial tension and tunable elasticity. For the first time we report here on the in vivo performance of a PAA hydrogel implant as scaffold for tissue engineering. In particular, an amphoteric agmatine-deriving PAA hydrogel shaped as small tubing was obtained by radical polymerization of a soluble functional oligomeric precursor and used as conduit for nerve regeneration in a rat sciatic nerve cut model. The animals were analyzed at 30, 90, and 180 days post-surgery. PAA tubing proved to facilitate nerve regeneration. Good surgical outcomes were achieved with no signs of inflammation or neuroma. Moreover, nerve regeneration was morphologically sound and the quality of functional recovery satisfactory. In conclusion, PAA hydrogel scaffolds may represent a novel and promising material for peripheral nerve regeneration.', 21514997: 'This study investigated the effect of manganese [Mn(IV)] amendment on the anaerobic biodegradation of four mixed PAHs, namely fluorene (Fl), phenanthrene (Phe), fluoranthene (Flua) and pyrene (Pyr) under low-oxygen condition, with and without the inoculation of enriched PAH-degrading bacterial consortia, in mangrove sediment slurries. The results revealed that the addition of Mn(IV) significantly inhibited PAH biodegradation, the rate of which was about 31-70% lower than the one of the groups without Mn(IV) addition. The amendment of Mn(IV) also showed adverse effect on the population size of enriched PAH-degrading bacteria and bacterial activity. The analysis results on the concentrations of Mn(II) and Mn(IV) indicated that Mn(IV) was converted to Mn(II) fast, the latter was the predominate manganese form in the mangrove sediment slurries through the whole experimental period. The Mn(II) toxicity to microorganisms was considered the main reason for inhibition of the PAH-biodegradation. On the other hand, the inoculation of the enriched PAH-degrading consortia significantly enhanced the biodegradation rates of all four PAHs, and the biodegradation rates of 3-rings (Fl, Phe) and 4-rings (Flua, Pyr) PAHs were enhanced by 14-15% and 21-34%, respectively.', 21531131: 'Densely cross-linked poly(vinylamine) microbeads (∼ 2 μm) were prepared by precipitation copolymerization of N-vinyl formamide and ethylene glycoldimethacrylate in acetonitrile. The formamido groups of the microbeads were hydrolyzed into amino groups. Then, amino-functionalized microbeads were used for covalent immobilization of laccase via glutaraldehyde coupling. The average amount of immobilized enzyme was 18.7 mg/g microbeads. Kinetic parameters, V(max) and K(m) values were determined as 20.7 U/mg protein and 2.76 × 10(-2)mmol/L for free enzyme and 15.8 U/mg protein and 4.65 mmol/L for the immobilized laccase, respectively. The immobilized laccase was operated in a batch reactor for the degradation of two different benzidine based dyes (i.e., Direct Blue 1 and Direct Red 128). The laccase immobilized on the microbeads was very effective for removal of these dyes which interfere with the hormonal system.', 21548136: 'Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used for bone tissue engineering due to their osteogenic differentiation capability, but their application is controversial. To enhance their capability, we prepared biodegradable gelatin sponges incorporating β-tricalcium phosphate ceramics (GT sponge), which has been shown to possess excellent controlled drug-release properties. The GT sponge was used as a carrier for both rat MSCs and bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and osteogenic differentiation was assessed by subcutaneous implantation of four different kinds of implants, i.e. GT-alone, MSC-GT composites, BMP-GT composites and BMP-GT composites supplemented with MSCs (BMP-MSC-GT) in rats. Two weeks after implantation, histological sections showed new bone formation in the peripheral parts of the BMP-GT and in almost the total volume of the BMP-MSC-GT implants. After 4 weeks, histology as well as microCT analyses demonstrated extensive bone formation in BMP-MSC-GT implants. Gene expression and biochemical analyses of both alkaline phosphatase and bone-specific osteocalcin confirmed the histological findings. These results indicate that the combination of MSCs, GT and BMP synergistically enhances osteogenic capability and provides a rational basis for their clinical application in bone reconstruction.', 21550234: 'Persimmon waste was chemically modified by crosslinking with concentrated sulfuric acid to obtain a novel kind of adsorption gel, which was termed as crosslinked persimmon tannin (CPT), hereinafter. The adsorption behaviors of Mo(VI) with other coexisting metal ions onto the CPT gel were investigated. The gel exhibited selectivity only for Mo(VI) ions evidenced by the high value of separation factor of molybdenum and rhenium (β(Mo/Re)=164.37), and the adsorption mechanism of Mo(VI) as a multispecies was studied. The molybdenum adsorption behavior conforms to the Langmuir model with a remarkably high adsorption capacity of 0.56 mol/kg. A kinetic study for the adsorption of molybdenum at various temperatures confirmed that the endothermic adsorption process followed pseudo-second order kinetics. Moreover, its excellent adsorption properties and applicability for Mo(VI) were demonstrated by the removal and separation of Mo(VI) from different Mo-Re containing industrial wastewaters.', 21550800: 'The present work was aimed at studying the efficiency of the combined process of biofiltration with ozonation to improve the quality of secondary effluent. The secondary effluent from the Dinapur Sewage Treatment Plant Varanasi, India was used in this work. The process of biofiltration with the plant species of Eichornia crassipes and Lemna minor, at a flow rate of 262 ml min(-1) and plant density of 30 mg L(-1) for 48 h, in combination with the process of ozonation with ozone dose of 10 mg L(-1) and contact time of 5 min was applied. Results revealed that combined process was statistically most suitable for the highest degradation of physico-chemical and microbial parameters with improving BDOC value. The biofiltration process is able to remove highest percentage of toxic heavy metals from the secondary effluent without production of toxicity. This technique is highly recommendable for tropical wastewater where sewage is mixed with industrial effluents.', 21565491: 'The present study deals with cultivation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) degrading aerobic granules in two SBR systems based on glucose and acetate as co-substrate. Biodegradation of TCP containing wastewater starting from 10 to 360 mg L(-1) with more than 90% efficiency was achieved. Sludge volume index decreases as the operation proceeds to stabilize at 35 and 30 mL g(-1) while MLVSS increases from 4 to 6.5 and 6.2 g L(-1) for R1 (with glucose as co-substrate) and R2 (with sodium acetate as co-substrate), respectively. FTIR, GC and GC/MS spectral studies shows that the biodegradation occurred via chlorocatechol pathway and the cleavage may be at ortho-position. Haldane model for inhibitory substrate was applied to the system and it was observed that glucose fed granules have a high specific degradation rate and efficiency than acetate fed granules. Genotoxicity studies shows that effluent coming from SBRs was non-toxic.', 21568316: 'We investigated the potential use of the alga Chara australis (R. Br.) forphytore mediation of Cd-contaminated sediments in aquatic systems. Chara tolerated up to 20 mg added Cd (kg soil)⁻¹ in laboratory culture. Chlorophyll a and b levels were not affected even at Cd concentrations that suppressed growth. Levels of glutathione were suppressed at 2-35 mg added Cd (kg soil)⁻¹ to 200-350 nmol GSH (g DW)⁻¹, while control levels were 660 nmol GSH (g DW)⁻¹). Histochemical studies showed Cd occurred throughout cell walls and cytoplasm in plants grown in 5-20 mg Cd (kg soil)⁻¹. Quantification using ICP-MS showed the maximum concentration in shoots was 72 mg Cd (kg DW)⁻¹ at 35 mg added Cd (kg soil)⁻¹, while the maximum in rhizoids was 116 mg Cd (kg DW)⁻¹ at 25 mg added Cd (kg soil)⁻¹. The bioconcentration factor (BCF, concentration in plant/concentration in soil) exceeded 1.0, the critical value for hyperaccumulators, for shoots exposed to 35 mg Cd (kg soil)⁻¹ and rhizoids exposed to ≥25 mg Cd (kg soil)⁻¹. Translocation factors (TF, shoot concentration/rhizoid concentration) did not exceed 1.0 for any treatment. While Chara cannot be considered a hyperaccumulator, it shows promise for use in phytoremediation efforts.', 21571105: 'A low density and high strength alloy, Ca65Mg15Zn20 bulk metallic glass (CaMgZn BMG), was evaluated by both in vitro tests on ion release and cytotoxicity and in vivo implantation, aimed at exploring the feasibility of this new biodegradable metallic material for potential skeletal applications. MTT assay results showed that the experimental CaMgZn BMG extracts had no detectable cytotoxic effects on L929, VSMC and ECV304 cells over a wide range of concentrations (0-50%), whereas for MG63 cells concentrations in the range ~5-20% promoted cell viability. Meanwhile, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity results showed that CaMgZn BMG extracts increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) production by MG63 cells. However, Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide staining indicated that higher concentrations (50%) might induce cell apoptosis. The fluorescence observation of F-actin and nuclei in MG63 cells showed that cells incubated with lower concentrations (0-50%) displayed no significant change in morphology compared with a negative control. Tumor necrosis factor-α expression by Raw264.7 cells in the presence of CaMgZn BMG extract was significantly lower than that of the positive and negative controls. Animal tests proved that there was no obvious inflammation reaction at the implantation site and CaMgZn BMG implants did not result in animal death. The cortical thickness around the CaMgZn BMG implant increased gradually from 1 to 4 weeks, as measured by in vivo micro-computer tomography.', 21571528: 'Ten different strains of marine cyanobacteria were tested for their ability to decolourise and degrade a recalcitrant diazo dye, C.I. Acid Black 1. Of them, Oscillatoria curvicepsBDU92191 was able to grow up to a tested concentration of 500 mG L(-1). The organism degraded 84% of the dye at 100 mG L(-1) in 8 days in a medium free of combined nitrogen. The dye degrading ability is attributed to the activities of the enzymes: laccase, polyphenol oxidase and azoreductase. The absence of the doublet amine peak in addition to the overall reduction of absorption in the IR spectra confirmed the mineralisation of the tested azo dye. The nitrogen assimilating enzyme studies along with nitrogenase assay strongly suggested the ability of the non-heterocystous, filamentous marine cyanobacterium, O. curvicepsBDU92191 to use C.I. Acid Black 1 as a nitrogen source in an oligotrophic environment.', 21598788: 'Chemical amendments can increase metal uptake by plant roots and translocation to shoots, however their effectiveness can be influenced by the presence of other amendments and metal ions in a multiple-metal environment. A range of amendments and combinations were tested to explore their effect on phytoextraction of Cu, Cd, and Pb by perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) from solutions containing one or more of these metals. The amendments studied included EDDS (an aminopolycarboxylic acid), histidine (an amino acid), citric acid (an organic acid), rhamnolipid (a biosurfactant) and sulfate (an inorganic ligand). For all amendment treatments, the presence of multiple metals in solution reduced shoot concentrations of Cd and Cu, while Pb levels in shoots were generally enhanced by the presence of Cu. Although slightly toxic to the plants, EDDS (1 mM) was the most effective individual amendment for enhancing shoot metal uptake and translocation from solution without significantly reducing biomass yield. The combination Rhm+Cit+EDDS resulted in the highest shoot metal concentrations of all the treatments but also caused severe phytotoxicity. Amendment combinations Rhm+His and Sulf+Cit were less toxic for plant growth while moderately enhancing metal mass accumulation in shoots and thus could be considered as alternative treatments for enhanced phytoextraction.', 21598794: 'Hydroponic culture was applied to compare the efficiency of K2EDTA and citrate in mobilizing Pb for accumulation in Agropyron elongatum cv. Szarvasi-1 and their effects on some physiological characteristics of the plants. The plants were grown in nutrient solutions containing 0, 10, and 100 microM Pb(NO3)2 combined with chelating agents added to the nutrient solutions after 21 days of growth, in 3 concentrations (0, 100, and 500 microM). The effects were measured after eight days. The energy grass proved to be greatly resistant to the treatments, as was reflected in the slight inhibition of growth, the resistance of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and the chlorophyll composition and the lack of change in the malone-dialdehyde content. Fundamental differences can be identified between the effects of EDTA and citrate. Citrate had only a little effect on the physiological parameters, which may be due to the strongly increasing lead accumulation with increasing concentration of Pb in the nutrient solution. Additionally, citrate ensured a higher biomass yield with higher shoot Pb accumulation compared to EDTA in almost all treatments. Concerning biomass reduction, 10 microM Pb applied together with K2EDTA has the most deleterious effects on energy grass. The effects correlated with the concentration of EDTA.', 21601018: 'An injectable biodegradable pH/temperature-sensitive oligo(β-amino ester urethane) (OAEU) was synthesized. The OAEU was synthesized by addition polymerization between the isocyanate groups of 1,6-diisocyanato hexamethylene and the hydroxyl groups of a synthesized monomer piperazine dihydroxyl amino ester (monomer PDE) in chloroform in the presence of dibutyltin dilaurate as a catalyst. The synthesized OAEU was characterized by (1)H NMR spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. The aqueous solutions of OAEU showed a sol-to-gel-to-sol phase transition as a function of temperature and pH. The gel window covered the physiological conditions (37°C, pH 7.4) and could be controlled by changing the OAEU concentration. After a subcutaneous injection of the OAEU solution into Sprague-Dawley rats, a gel formed rapidly in situ and remained in the body for more than 2 weeks. The in vitro cytotoxicity test and in vitro degradation showed that the OAEU hydrogel was non-cytotoxic and biodegradable. The in vitro release of doxorubicin from this OAEU hydrogel was sustained for more than 10 days. This injectable biodegradable pH/temperature-sensitive OAEU hydrogel is a potential candidate as a drug/protein carrier and in biomedical applications.', 21604378: \"Microchannel-patterned starch-poly(capro-lactone)/hydydroxyapatite (SPCL-HA) and starch-poly(lactic acid) (SPLA) composite membranes were produced for use as a laminated tissue-engineering scaffold that incorporates both physical and biochemical patterns. For this purpose, SPCL (30% starch) blended with inorganic hydroxyl apatite (50%) and SPLA (50% starch) membranes were made with compressive moulding. Consequently, the microchannel structures (width 102 µm, 174 µm intervals) were developed on the composite membranes by means of micro-patterned metal mould(s) and hydraulic pressing. An elastomer poly(dimetylsiloxane) stamp was used to transfer heparin as a biochemical cue over the microchannel surfaces by micro-contact printing (µCP). Toluidine blue staining of developed capillaries and heparin µCP-coated membranes showed that heparin was transferred predominantly over the microchannel surfaces. Fibroblast cell culture over the microchannel-formed and heparin µCP-modified SPCL-HA and SPLA membranes showed distinct growth patterns. In contrast to the uniform cell layer formed on unmodified microchannels, the cells were bridging across the grooves of heparin-printed microchannels. At extended culture periods, the heparin-printed microchannels were covered with a layer of fibroblast cells without cellular ingrowths inside. This study indicated that the topographical pattern could induce an organization of fibroblasts only with the biochemical cue and the cells' functions can be controlled spatially over the microchannels by using both cues.\", 21612916: 'In this work, we introduce a biological detoxification method that converts toxic waste from castor beans into animal feed material. This method simultaneously induces the production of tannase and phytase by Paecilomyces variotii; both enzymes have high levels of activity and have the potential to be used in feedstuffs because they decrease overall anti-nutritional factors. The maximum tannase and phytase activities obtained were 2600 and 260 U/g after 48 and 72 h, respectively. SDS-PAGE electrophoresis of the fermented castor cake extracts revealed a reduction in ricin bands during fermentation, and the bands were no longer visible after 48 h. The cytotoxicity of the extracts was evaluated by MTT testing on RAW cells, and a progressive increase in cellular viability was obtained, reaching almost 100% after 72 h of fermentation.', 21637824: StringElement('In order to improve implant success rate, it is important to enhance their responsiveness to the prevailing conditions following implantation.

Here, we evaluated enzymatically synthesized poly(PDL-co-DO) copolymers as new materials for biomedical applications. In vivo experiments using mice, showed that the copolyesters are well tolerated, with tissue responses that are comparable to poly(p-dioxanone). In addition, the copolymers were found to degrade hydrolytically at controlled rates over a period of several months under physiological conditions. The poly(PDL-co-DO) copolymers with up to 69 mol% DO units were successfully transformed to free-standing nanoparticles that are capable of encapsulating an anticancer drug, doxorubicin, or a polynucleotide, siRNA. Drug- or siRNA-loaded nanoparticles exhibited controlled and continuous release of agent over many weeks. In addition, siLUC-encapsulated poly(PDL-co-DO) nanoparticles were active in inhibiting luciferase gene expression in LUC-RKO cells. Because of substantial differences in structure and hydrophobicity between PDL and DO units, poly(PDL-co-DO) biodegradation rate and physical properties can be tuned over a wide range depending on the copolymer composition. Our results demonstrate that the semicrystalline and biodegradable poly(PDL-co-DO) copolyesters are promising biomaterials to serve as drug carriers, as well as potential raw materials for constructing bioabsorbable sutures and other medical devices.', 21647688: \"Co-cultivation was a potential strategy in lignocellulolytic biodegradation with producing high activity enzymes due to their synergistic action. The objective of this study was to investigate the rarely understood effects of co-culturing of two white-rot fungi on lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs) production. Six species, Bjerkandera adusta, Phlebia radiata, Pleurotus ostreatus, Dichomitus squalens, Hypoxylon fragiforme and Pleurotus eryngii, were cultured in pairs to study the production of LMEs. The paired hyphal interaction observed showed that P. eryngii is not suitable for co-growth. The use of agar plates containing dye RBBR showed elevated decolourisation at the confrontation zone between mycelia. Laccase was significantly stimulated only in the co-culture of P. radiata with D. squalens under submerged cultivation; the highest value was measured after 4 days of incubation (120 U mg(-1)). The improved productions of MnP and LiP were simultaneously observed at the co-culture of P. ostreatus and P. radiata (MnP\\u2009=\\u2009800 nkat L(-1) after 4 days of incubation; LiP\\u2009=\\u200960 nkat L(-1) after 7 days of incubation), though it was not a good producer of laccase. P. ostreatus appeared to possess specific potential to be used in co-cultured production of LMEs. The phenotype of LMEs production was not only dependent on the species used but also regulated by different nutritions available in the culture medium. The present data will provide evidence for illustrating the regulatory roles of C/N on LMEs production under the co-cultures' circumstances.\", 21678910: 'Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in the manufacture of plastics, and has been identified in various environmental matrices, including human serum and breast milk. The prevalence of BPA in the environment and the potential exposure to humans underscores the need to more fully understand the fate of BPA in the environment and the resulting effects and toxicity to humans and other organisms. Here we demonstrate that Mycobacterium species, including Mycobacterium vanbaalenii strain PYR-1, are able to O-methylate BPA to its mono- and dimethyl ether derivatives (BPA MME and BPA DME, respectively). The O-methylation of BPA results in metabolites with increased toxicity as shown from differences in survival and occurrence of developmental lesions in developing zebrafish embryos exposed to BPA, BPA MME, and BPA DME. The mono- and dimethyl ether derivatives were more toxic than BPA, resulting in increased mortality at 5 (LC(50) = 0.66 and 1.2 mg L(-1)) and 28 (LC(50) = 0.38, <0.5 mg L(-1)) days post fertilization. Furthermore, exposure to either of the O-methylated metabolites resulted in an increase in the incidence of developmental lesions as compared to BPA exposure. These data illustrate a new mechanism for microbial transformation of BPA, producing metabolites warranting further study to understand their prevalence and effects in the environment.', 21706776: 'To treat large bone defects is a clinically challenging problem and utilizing tissue engineering technology is an attractive approach for overcoming such a problem. Previously, a biodegradable sponge incorporating bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2), which can control the release of BMP-2 for a prolonged time in an in vivo environment, was reported. In addition, a biodegradable sponge composed of gelatin and β-tricalcium phosphate (βTCP), gelatin-βTCP sponge to develop a more ideal scaffold for enhancing bone regeneration was also created and previously reported. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the gelatin-βTCP sponge for the promotion of bone regeneration in a critical-sized bone defect site in vivo. Apparent bone regeneration was induced by the gelatin sponge incorporating BMP-2 and the gelatin-βTCP sponge with BMP-2 incorporation. In contrast, no apparent bone formation was induced by either the gelatin sponge only or the gelatin-βTCP sponge without BMP-2. To investigate the quality of the regenerated bone, we conducted a biomechanical evaluation with a three-point bending test. We found no significant difference between the gelatin sponge incorporating BMP-2 and the gelatin-βTCP sponge incorporating BMP-2 groups. Incorporation of βTCP into the gelatin sponge was expected to enhance biomechanical strength during the initial bone regeneration. However, our observations showed that the gelatin-βTCP sponge did not significantly improve the quality of regenerated bone from the viewpoint of biomechanical assessment, even though it did not impair the effectiveness of the promotion of bone regeneration by BMP-2 in the bone defect.', 21712105: \"Nowadays, α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP, α-Ca(3)(PO(4))(2)) is receiving growing attention as a raw material for several injectable hydraulic bone cements, biodegradable bioceramics and composites for bone repair. In the phase equilibrium diagram of the CaO-P(2)O(5) system, three polymorphs corresponding to the composition Ca(3)(PO(4))(2) are recognized: β-TCP, α-TCP and α'-TCP. α-TCP is formed by heating the low-temperature polymorph β-TCP or by thermal crystallization of amorphous precursors with the proper composition above the transformation temperature. The α-TCP phase may be retained at room temperature in a metastable state, and its range of stability is strongly influenced by ionic substitutions. It is as biocompatible as β-TCP, but more soluble, and hydrolyses rapidly to calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite, which makes α-TCP a useful component for preparing self-setting osteotransductive bone cements and biodegradable bioceramics and composites for bone repairing. The literature published on the synthesis and properties of α-TCP is sometimes contradictory, and therefore this article focuses on reviewing and critically discussing the synthetic methods and physicochemical and biological properties of α-TCP-based biomaterials (excluding α-TCP-based bone cements).\", 21723341: 'Real-time quantitative PCR analyses of Escherichia coli str. BL21(DE3) exposed to 0.5 g/L ferulic and coumaric acid showed that the inaA gene was significantly induced (7.7- and 3.6-fold higher, respectively). Consequently, a transcriptional fusion of the inaA promoter with the luxCDABE operon was constructed and characterized with several compounds identified within hydrolysates. Tests demonstrated that the phenolics were major inducers, while acetic acid and furfural had only a minor or no effect on the inaA expression respectively. Additional tests with mutant E. coli strains found that a marA partially abolished the response while a marB knock-out led to a 2-3-fold higher basal level expression as evidenced by the bioluminescent levels of the cultures. However, a significant induction was seen even in the marA mutant, suggesting some other control mechanism is involved in regulating inaA expression during an exposure to the hydrolysate compounds. Finally, E. coli str. BL21(DE3)/pSP4 was used to analyze a spruce hydrolysate sample. Real-time quantitative PCR showed a 2.8-fold induction of the inaA expression level while the bioluminescence from the exposed culture was 22-fold higher than the control, demonstrating the possible application of this reporter strain to analyze hydrolysates for the presence of fermentation-inhibiting phenolics.', 21723652: 'Onshore oil production pipelines are major installations in the petroleum industry, stretching many thousands of kilometres worldwide which also contain flowline additives.

Main biochemical properties of this laccase, such as thermodependence and thermostability, optimal pH and pH stability, and the effect of metal ions and inhibitors, were characterized. With 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate (ABTS) as the substrate, MfLcc had its optimal pH at 3.5 and optimal temperature at 45°C.

In this study, we examined the mechanisms by which the white-rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus metabolizes CBZ in liquid culture using a physiological approach. P. ostreatus PC9 was grown in media known to support different levels of a multiplicity of enzyme systems such as cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and manganese peroxidase (MnP). When both CYP450 and MnP systems were active, 99% of the added CBZ was eliminated from the solution and transformed to 10,11-epoxycarbamazepine. High removal of CBZ was also obtained when either MnP or CYP450 was active. When both CYP450 and MnP were inactivated, only 10 to 30% of the added CBZ was removed. In this latter system, removal of CBZ might be partially attributed to the activity of versatile peroxidase. P. ostreatus was able to eliminate CBZ in liquid culture even when CBZ was added at an environmentally relevant concentration (1 μg L(-1)). On the basis of our study, we suggest that two families of enzymes are involved in the oxidation of CBZ in liquid culture: MnP in a Mn(2+)-dependent or independent manner and CYP450. Our study also highlights the potential of using P. ostreatus for bioremediation systems.', 21755293: \"Laccases are strong oxidizing enzymes that oxidize chlorinated phenols, synthetic dyes, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as a very wide range of other compounds with high redox potential.

The scaffold consists of a solid poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) intramedullary rod for mechanical support surrounded by a porous PPF sleeve for osseointegration and delivery of poly(dl-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres with adsorbed recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). Scaffolds were implanted into critical size rat segmental femoral defects with internal fixation for 12 weeks. Bone formation was assessed throughout the study via radiography, and following euthanasia, via microcomputed tomography and histology. Mechanical stabilization was evaluated further via torsional testing. Experimental implant groups included the PPF rod alone and the rod with a porous PPF sleeve containing PLGA microspheres with 0, 2 or 8 μg of rhBMP-2 adsorbed onto their surface. Results showed that presence of the scaffold increased mechanical stabilization of the defect, as evidenced by the increased torsional stiffness of the femurs by the presence of a rod compared to the empty defect. Although the presence of a rod decreased bone formation, the presence of a sleeve combined with a low or high dose of rhBMP-2 increased the torsional stiffness to 2.06 ± 0.63 and 1.68 ± 0.56 N·mm, respectively, from 0.56 ± 0.24 N·mm for the rod alone. The results indicate that, while scaffolds may provide structural support to regenerating tissues and increase their mechanical properties, the presence of scaffolds within defects may hinder overall bone formation if they interfere with cellular processes.', 21790056: 'Filamentous fungi are able to accumulate significant amount of metals from their environment.

A. niger and P. simplicissimum, were able to survive at 1000 mg/L of Cu(II) concentration on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) while for Pb, only A. niger survived at 5000 mg/L concentration. The results showed that A. niger, P. simplicissimum and T. asperellum have a better uptake capacity for Pb compared to Cu and the findings indicated promising biosorption of Cu and Pb by these filamentous fungi from aqueous solution. The present study was also determined the maximum removal of Cu(II) and Pb(II) that was performed by A. niger. The metal removal which occurred at Cu(II) 200 mg/L was (20.910 +/- 0.581) mg/g and at 250 mg/L of Pb(II) was (54.046 +/- 0.328) mg/g.', 21800120: 'This paper presents results on anaerobic degradation of the azo dye blue HFRL in a bench scale Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor operated at ambient temperature. The results show that the addition of yeast extract (500\\xa0mg/L) increased color removal (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05) from 62 to 93% despite the low chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal (~35%) which happened due to volatile fatty acids (VFA) accumulation. There were no differences in color removal (~91%) when yeast extract (500\\xa0mg/L) was used in the presence or absence of glucose, suggesting that yeast extract acted as source of redox mediator (riboflavin) and carbon. The specific rate of dye removal increased along the operational phases and depended on the presence of yeast extract, suggesting progressive biomass acclimatization. Analysis of bacterial diversity by Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) method showed there was biomass selection along the bioreactor operation and no evidence of azo dye degrading bacteria predominance. This strengthens the hypothesis that color removal happens extracellularly by the reduction of azo bond by reduced redox mediators, such as riboflavin, which is present in high amount in the yeast extract.', 21807039: 'Recently, research on the use of binary aqueous-organic liquid phase systems for the treatment of polluted air has significantly increased. This paper reports the removal of α-pinene from a waste air stream in a continuous stirred tank bioreactor (CSTB), using either a single-liquid aqueous phase or a mixed aqueous-organic liquid phase. The influence of gas flow rate, load and pollutant concentration was evaluated as well as the effect of the organic to aqueous phase ratio. Continuous experiments were carried out at different inlet α-pinene concentrations, ranging between 0.03 and 25.1 g m⁻³ and at four different flow rates, corresponding to residence times (RTs) of 120 s, 60 s, 36 s and 26 s. The maximum elimination capacities (ECs) reached in the CSTB were 382 g m⁻³ h⁻¹ (without silicone oil) and 608 g m⁻³ h⁻¹ (with 5%v/v silicone oil), corresponding to a 1.6-fold improvement using an aqueous-organic liquid phase. During shock-loads experiments, the performance and stability of the CSTB were enhanced with 5% silicone oil, quickly recovering almost 100% removal efficiency (RE), when pre-shock conditions were restored. The addition of silicone oil acted as a buffer for high α-pinene loads, showing a more stable behaviour in the case of two-liquid-phase systems.', 21809019: 'An aerobic microorganism with an ability to utilize phenol as sole carbon and energy source was isolated from phenol-contaminated wastewater samples. The isolate was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strain WJDB-1 based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics, and 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Strain WJDB-1 immobilized in alginate-chitosan-alginate (ACA) microcapsules could degrade 200\\xa0mg/l phenol completely within 36\\xa0h. The concentration of phenol was determined using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) at glassy carbon electrode (GCE) with a linear relationship between peak current and phenol concentration ranging from 2.0 to 20.0\\xa0mg/l. Cells immobilized in ACA microcapsules were found to be superior to the free suspended ones in terms of improving the tolerance to the environmental loadings. The optimal conditions to prepare microcapsules for achieving higher phenol degradation rate were investigated by changing the concentrations of sodium alginate, calcium chloride, and chitosan. Furthermore, the efficiency of phenol degradation was optimized by adjusting various processing parameters, such as the number of microcapsules, pH value, temperature, and the initial concentration of phenol. This microorganism has the potential for the efficient treatment of organic pollutants in wastewater.', 21822953: 'Fungal biomass has the ability to decolorize a wide variety of dyes successfully through a number of mechanisms. A brown rot isolate, previously identified as Aspergillus sp. EL-2, was used in the aerobic treatment of textile waste water efficiently. In the current work, the treated waste water was tested chemically using more than one combined treatment. Microbial toxicity, phytotoxicity, genotoxicity and cytotoxicity were also studied to assess the toxicity level for each treatment. The obtained data suggest that the contribution of more than one mode of treatment is essential to ensure complete destruction of the by-products. The use of gamma irradiation (25 kGy) after the bioremediation step led to the decrease of the by-products of biodegradation as observed by visible spectrum and Fourier transfer infra red spectroscopy (FT-IR). The toxicity assessment presented variable results indicating the need for more than one toxicity test to confirm the presence or absence of hazardous compounds. Brown rot fungus could be used efficiently in the treatment of textile waste water without the risk of obtaining high carcinogenic or genotoxic compounds, especially if combined treatment is employed.', 21824771: 'The aim of this study was to determine the impact of a static magnetic field (MF) of 7 mT on formaldehyde (FA) biodegradation by activated sludge in synthetic wastewater. The MF had a positive effect on activated sludge biomass growth and dehydrogenase activity. The influence of the MF on the degradation process was observed with a FA concentration of 2400-2880 mg/l. Decreases in FA concentration and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were greater, by 30% and 26% respectively, than those in the control sample. At initial FA concentrations in raw wastewater of 2400 and 2880 mg/l, a decrease in the wastewater biodegradation efficiency was observed. This resulted in an increase of the ecotoxicity of the effluent to Daphnia magna. The value of the sludge biotic index (SBI) was dependent on the FA concentration in raw wastewater and the induction of the MF.', 21826608: 'Silicate (Si) can enhance plant resistance or tolerance to the toxicity of heavy metals. However, it remains unclear whether Si can ameliorate lead (Pb) toxicity in banana (Musa xparadisiaca) roots. In this study, treatment with 800 mg kg(-1) Pb decreased both the shoot and root weight of banana seedlings. The amendment of 800 mg kg(-1) Si (sodium metasilicate, Na(2)SiO(3)·9H(2)O) to the Pb-contaminated soil enhanced banana biomass at two growth stages significantly. The amendment of 800 mg kg(-1) Si significantly increased soil pH and decreased exchangeable Pb, thus reducing soil Pb availability, while Si addition of 100 mg kg(-1) did not influence soil pH. Results from Pb fractionation analysis indicated that more Pb were in the form of carbonate and residual-bound fractions in the Si-amended Pb-contaminated soils. The ratio of Pb-bound carbonate to the total Pb tended to increase with increasing growth stages. Treatment with 100 mg kg(-1) Si had smaller effects on Pb forms in the Si-amended soils than that of 800 mg kg(-1) Si. Pb treatment decreased the xylem sap greatly, but the addition of Si at both levels increased xylem sap and reduced Pb concentration in xylem sap significantly in the Si-amended Pb treatments. The addition of Si increased the activities of POD, SOD, and CAT in banana roots by 14.2% to 72.1% in the Si-amended Pb treatments. The results suggested that Si-enhanced tolerance to Pb toxicity in banana seedlings was associated with Pb immobilization in the soils, the decrease of Pb transport from roots to shoots, and Si-mediated detoxification of Pb in the plants.', 21842206: 'The terpene 2-methylisoborneol (MIB), a major cause of off-flavor in farm-raised catfish and drinking water, is transformed by various different terpene-degrading bacteria. Two of these, the R-limonene-degrading strains Pseudomonas sp. 19-rlim and Sphingomonas sp. BIR2-rlima, dehydrated MIB with the formation of odorless metabolites 2-methylenebornane and 4-methylcamphene. These metabolites which have a structural resemblance to camphor, could be further transformed by camphor-degrading bacteria to more oxidized products. The bacterial dehydrations demonstrated here may have application in removing MIB where it is a problem.', 21850504: 'Gene bioaugmentation is a bioremediation strategy that enhances biodegradative potential via dissemination of degradative genes from introduced microorganisms to indigenous microorganisms. Bioremediation experiments using 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)-contaminated soil slurry and strains of Pseudomonas putida or Escherichia coli harboring a self-transmissible 2,4-D degradative plasmid pJP4 were conducted in microcosms to assess possible effects of gene bioaugmentation on the overall microbial community structure and ecological functions (carbon source utilization and nitrogen transformation potentials). Although exogenous bacteria decreased rapidly, 2,4-D degradation was stimulated in bioaugmented microcosms, possibly because of the occurrence of transconjugants by the transfer of pJP4. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that, although the bacterial community structure was disturbed immediately after introducing exogenous bacteria to the inoculated microcosms, it gradually approached that of the uninoculated microcosms. Biolog assay, nitrate reduction assay, and monitoring of the amoA gene of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and nirK and nirS genes of denitrifying bacteria showed no irretrievable depressive effects of gene bioaugmentation on the carbon source utilization and nitrogen transformation potentials. These results may suggest that gene bioaugmentation with P. putida and E. coli strains harboring pJP4 is effective for the degradation of 2,4-D in soil without large impacts on the indigenous microbial community.', 21861477: 'Intimate coupling of photocatalysis and biodegradation (ICPB) offers potential for degrading biorecalcitrant and toxic organic compounds. This study reports on a novel sponge-type, TiO(2)-coated biofilm carrier that showed significant adherence of TiO(2) and ability to accumulate biomass in its interior. This carrier was tested for ICPB in a continuous-flow photocatalytic circulating-bed biofilm reactor (PCBBR) to mineralize 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP), which is biorecalcitrant. Four mechanisms possibly acting in ICPB were tested separately: TCP adsorption to the carrier, UV photolysis, UV photocatalysis, and biodegradation by biofilm inside the carrier. The carrier exhibited strong TCP adsorption that followed a Freundlich isotherm with an exponent near 2. Whereas UV photolysis was negligible, photocatalysis produced TCP-degradation products that could be mineralized, and the strong adsorption of TCP to the carrier enhanced biodegradation by relieving toxicity. Validating the ICPB concept, biofilm was protected inside the carriers, although biomass originally on the outer surface of the carriers was eliminated. ICPB significantly lowered the diversity of the bacterial community, but five genera known to biodegrade chlorinated phenols (Ralstonia, Bradyrhizobium, Methylobacterium, Cupriavidus, and Pandoraea) were markedly enriched.', 21868217: 'A new bacterial strain exhibiting laccase activity was isolated from forest soil and was identified as Bacillus licheniformis LS04. The spore laccase of B. licheniformis LS04 demonstrated a broad pH range for catalyzing substrates. It was quite stable at high temperature and alkaline pH. There was no loss of laccase activity after 10 days incubation at pH 9.0, and about 16% of the initial activity was detected after 10h at 80°C. In addition, the spore laccase was tolerant towards 1M of NaCl and 30% of organic solvents. Reactive black 5, reactive blue 19 and indigo carmine were decolorized by the spore laccase in the absence of mediator. Meanwhile, the decolorization process was efficiently promoted when acetosyringone was present, with more than 80% of color removal in 1h at pH 6.6 or 9.0. The unusual properties indicated a high potential in industrial applications for this novel spore laccase.', 21870159: 'A laboratory study was conducted to investigate the influence of four PGPR strains on the degradation of five soil applied pesticides and their effects on bacterial growth. Interactions of Bacillus subtilis GB03, Bacillus subtilis FZB24, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens IN937a and Bacillus pumilus SE34 with two concentrations of acibenzolar-S-methyl, metribuzin, napropamide, propamocarb hydrochloride and thiamethoxam in liquid culture and soil microcosm were studied. The degradation of acibenzolar-S-methyl by all PGPR tested in low and high concentration, was 5.4 and 5.7 times, respectively, faster than that in non-inoculated liquid culture medium. At the end of the 72-h liquid cultured experiments, 8-18, 9-11, 15-36 and 11-22% of metribuzin, napropamide, propamocarb hydrochloride and thiamethoxam, respectively, had disappeared from PGPR inoculated medium. Under the soil microcosm experimental conditions, the half-lives of acibenzolar-S-methyl incubated in the presence of PGPR strains spiked at 1.0 and 10.0\\xa0mg\\xa0kg(-1) were 10.3-16.4 and 9.2-15.9\\xa0days, respectively, markedly lower compared with >34.2\\xa0days in the control. From the rest pesticides studied degradation of propamocarb hydrochloride and thiamethoxam was enhanced in the presence of B. amyloliquefaciens IN937a and B. pumilus SE34. Acibenzolar-S-methyl, propamocarb hydrochloride and thiamethoxam significantly increased the PGPR growth. However, the stimulatory effect was related to the level of pesticide spiked.', 21890166: 'This study investigated the effect of short-chain organic acids on biosurfactant-enhanced mobilization of phenanthrene in soil-water system. The desorption characteristics of phenanthrene by soils were assessed in the presence of rhamnolipid and four SCOAs, including acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid and citric acid. The tests with rhamnolipid and different organic acids could attain the higher desorption of phenanthrene compared to those with only rhamnolipid. Among the different combinations, the series with rhamnolipid and citric acid exhibited more significant effect on the desorption performance. The removal of phenanthrene using rhamnolipid and SCOAs gradually increased as the SCOA concentration increased up to a concentration of 300 mmol/L. The effects of pH, soil dissolved organic matter and ionic strength were further evaluated in the presence of both biosurfactant and SCOAs. The results showed that the extent of phenanthrene desorption was more significant at pH 6 and 9. Desorption of phenanthrene was relatively lower in the DOM-removed soils with the addition of biosurfactant and SCOAs. The presence of more salt ions made phenanthrene more persistent on the solid phase and adversely affected its desorption from contaminated soil. The results from this study may have important implications for soil washing technologies used to treat PAH-contaminated soil and groundwater.', 21890340: 'The study reports production of hydrogen in photobioreactors with free (PBR(Fr)) and immobilized (PBR(Imm)) Nostoc biomass at enhanced and sustained rates. Before running the photobioreactors, effects of different immobilization matrices and cyanobacterial dose on hydrogen production were studied in batch mode. As hydrogen production in the PBRs declined spent biomass from the photobioreactors were collected and utilized further for column biosorption of highly toxic dyes (Reactive Red 198+Crystal Violet) and metals (hexavalent chromium and bivalent cobalt) from simulated textile wastewater. Breakthrough time, adsorption capacity and exhaustion time of the biosorption column were studied. The photobioreactors with free and immobilized cyanobacterium produced hydrogen at average rates of 101 and 151 μmol/h/mg Chl a, respectively over 15 days, while the adsorption capacity of the spent biomass was up to 1.4 and 0.23 mg/g for metals and 15 and 1.75 mg/g for the dyes, respectively in continuous column mode.', 21890348: 'The azoreductase PpAzoR from Pseudomonas putida shows a broader specificity for decolourization of azo dyes than CotA-laccase from Bacillus subtilis. However, the final products of PpAzoR activity exhibited in most cases a 2 to 3-fold higher toxicity than intact dyes themselves. We show that addition of CotA-laccase to PpAzoR reaction mixtures lead to a significant drop in the final toxicity. A sequential enzymatic process was validated through the use of 18 representative azo dyes and three model wastewaters that mimic real dye-containing effluents. A heterologous Escherichia coli strain was successfully constructed co-expressing the genes coding for both PpAzoR and CotA. Whole-cell assays of recombinant strain for the treatment of model dye wastewater resulted in decolourization levels above 80% and detoxification levels up to 50%. The high attributes of this strain, make it a promising candidate for the biological treatment of industrial dye containing effluents.', 21893412: 'The performance of acetic acid-supported pH-heterogenized heterotrophic denitrification (HD) facilitated with ferrous sulfide-based autotrophic denitrification (AD) was investigated in upflow activated carbon-packed column reactors for reliable removal of highly elevated nitrate (42 mg NO(3)-Nl(-1)) in drinking water. The use of acetic acid as substrate provided sufficient internal carbon dioxide to completely eliminate the need of external pH adjustment for HD, but simultaneously created vertically heterogenized pH varying from 4.8 to 7.8 in the HD reactor. After 5-week acclimation, the HD reactor developed a moderate nitrate removal capacity with about one third of nitrate removal occurring in the acidic zone (pH 4.8-6.2). To increase the treatment reliability, acetic acid-supported HD was operated under 10% carbon limitation to remove >85% of nitrate, and ferrous sulfide-based AD was supplementally operated to remove residual nitrate and formed nitrite without excess of soluble organic carbon, nitrite or sulfate in the final effluent.', 21896750: \"The in situ stimulation of Fe(III) oxide reduction by Geobacter bacteria leads to the concomitant precipitation of hexavalent uranium [U(VI)] from groundwater. Despite its promise for the bioremediation of uranium contaminants, the biological mechanism behind this reaction remains elusive. Because Fe(III) oxide reduction requires the expression of Geobacter's conductive pili, we evaluated their contribution to uranium reduction in Geobacter sulfurreducens grown under pili-inducing or noninducing conditions. A pilin-deficient mutant and a genetically complemented strain with reduced outer membrane c-cytochrome content were used as controls. Pili expression significantly enhanced the rate and extent of uranium immobilization per cell and prevented periplasmic mineralization. As a result, pili expression also preserved the vital respiratory activities of the cell envelope and the cell's viability. Uranium preferentially precipitated along the pili and, to a lesser extent, on outer membrane redox-active foci. In contrast, the pilus-defective strains had different degrees of periplasmic mineralization matching well with their outer membrane c-cytochrome content. X-ray absorption spectroscopy analyses demonstrated the extracellular reduction of U(VI) by the pili to mononuclear tetravalent uranium U(IV) complexed by carbon-containing ligands, consistent with a biological reduction. In contrast, the U(IV) in the pilin-deficient mutant cells also required an additional phosphorous ligand, in agreement with the predominantly periplasmic mineralization of uranium observed in this strain. These findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for Geobacter conductive pili in the extracellular reduction of uranium, and highlight its essential function as a catalytic and protective cellular mechanism that is of interest for the bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater.\", 21902607: 'Tissue engineering constitutes a promising alternative technology to transplantation medicine by creating viable substitutes for failing tissues or organs. The ability to manipulate and reconstitute tissue function has tremendous clinical implications and will most likely play a key role in cell and gene therapies in the coming years. In the present work, a novel injectable and biodegradable biomaterial is reported that could be injected on the human body with a surgical syringe. The material prepared is a blend of polycaprolactone (PCL), a biodegradable and elastic biomedical polymer, and sebacic acid, a natural polymer part of castor oil with low molecular weight to accelerate the slow degradation rate of PCL. The biocompatibility of the blend was evaluated in vitro and its in vivo behavior was also assessed through subcutaneous and bone implantation in rats to evaluate its tissue-forming ability and degradation rate. The results allowed the conclusion that the gel is biocompatible, promotes the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, and presents an adequate degradation rate for use in bone tissue engineering. In vivo the gel blends promoted tissue regeneration and adverse reactions were not observed on subcutaneous and bone implants.', 21907404: 'The effective passage of drug formulations into tumor cells is a key factor in the development of nanoscale delivery systems. However, rapid cellular uptake with reduced toxicity remains a great challenge for efficient and safe delivery. In this study, we first use gemini quaternary ammonium (GQA) as a cell internalization promoter to enhance the cellular uptake of drug nanocarriers. It is found that a twenty times faster cell internalization could be achieved by introducing GQA into biodegradable multiblock polyurethane nanomicelles, as confirmed by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) studies. Meanwhile, an added methoxyl-poly(ethylene glycol) (mPEG) outer corona could protect these cationic micelles from cytotoxicity at high concentrations, as verified by methyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Moreover, GQA not only acts as an enhancer for rapid cellular entry, but also plays an important role in controlled self-assembly and high drug loading capacity. Our work offers a new understanding on the role of cationic surfactants; and provides a facile and economical approach for the design of versatile drug nanocarriers to achieve efficient delivery and good biocompatibility.', 21907571: 'The objective of this study was to evaluate the promotion effect of ammonia on the biodegradation of polylactide (PLA) under hyperthermophilic (80°C) and thermophilic (55°C) anaerobic condition. The results showed that PLA was transformed to lactic acid under hyperthermophilic conditions, but that the transformation ratio was negligible under thermophilic conditions. The hydrolysis process can be markedly increased with ammonia addition and microorganism activity. The maximum transformation ratios of the two kinds of PLA used in this study were 65.2% and 51.8%, respectively, with ammonia addition of 4 g N/L over 3 days treatment of anaerobic sludge. After the hyperthermophilic pretreatment, the hydrolysis products were converted to methane by methanogens under the thermophilic and anaerobic conditions. The final methane conversion ratios of the two kinds of PLA after 22 days treatment were 81.8% and 77.0%, respectively.', 21924755: 'The optimization of TiO(2)-impregnated chitosan beads (TICB) as an arsenic adsorbent is investigated to maximize the capacity and kinetics of arsenic removal. It has been previously reported that TICB can 1) remove arsenite, 2) remove arsenate, and 3) oxidize arsenite to arsenate in the presence of UV light and oxygen. Herein, it is reported that adsorption capacity for TICB is controlled by solution pH and TiO(2) loading within the bead and enhanced with exposure to UV light. Solution pH is found to be a critical parameter, whereby arsenate is effectively removed below pH 7.25 and arsenite is effectively removed below pH 9.2. A model to predict TICB capacity, based on TiO(2) loading and solution pH, is presented for arsenite, arsenate, and total arsenic in the presence of UV light. The rate of removal is increased with reductions in bead size and with exposure to UV light. Phosphate is found to be a direct competitor with arsenate for adsorption sites on TICB, but other relevant common background groundwater ions do not compete with arsenate for adsorption sites. TICB can be regenerated with weak NaOH and maintain full adsorption capacity for at least three adsorption/desorption cycles.', 21924893: 'This study sets up microcosms using two types of compost samples, bagasse/manure compost, and yard-trimming compost with different maturity, to evaluate their capacity for reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene (PCE). The experimental results show that less matured compost samples could reduce 300 μM of PCE to ethene within 180 days of incubation. Decreasing initial PCE concentration and removing dissolved oxygen from the solution could enhance reducing efficiency. The solution remains near neutral pH throughout the experiment, and ethene emerged when the redox potential dropped to below -150 mV. Different microbial inhibition agents, such as 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid and sodium molybdate 2-hydrate, exhibit different effects on the dechlorination efficiency. The potential advantages of using compost to remove PCE are discussed. Overall, due to their high carbon content, diverse microbial activity, high buffer capacity, and complex physical structure, compost samples could serve as suitable media for dechlorinating PCE.', 21925876: 'A novel protease secreted by Brevibacillus sp. KH3 isolated from excess sludge at 50 °C and used as a sludge-lysing strain was investigated in this study. Sludge reduction was minimized by protease inhibitors and a 40-kDa protease, which significantly contributed to this sludge-reducing activity, was purified as the target protein. The final purified protease demonstrated 92-fold higher specific activity than the initial crude extracts. The sludge-reducing efficiency deteriorated relative to decreased protease activity triggered by EDTA; thus, the purified protease was a causative agent in reducing excess sludge. The 40-kDa protease was a serine metalloprotease and showed the highest activity at 50 °C and pH 8.0, and the activity was enhanced in the presence of calcium ions, indicating that the purified protease contained calcium ion. Furthermore, this 40-kDa protease inhibited biofilm formation in excess sludge. These results imply that sludge reduction is because of reduction of biofilm formation in excess sludge.', 21933017: 'A biodegradable elastomeric scaffold was created by electrospinning a mixed solution of poly(ester urethane)urea (PEUU) and porcine dermal extracellular matrix (dECM) digest, with PEUU included to provide elasticity, flexibility, and mechanical support and dECM used to enhance bioactivity and biocompatibility. Micrographs and differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated partial miscibility between PEUU and dECM. With greater dECM content, scaffolds were found to possess lower breaking strains and suture retention strength, although initial modulus was greater with higher dECM concentrations. The hybrid scaffolds containing 0% to 50% dECM had tensile strengths of 5 to 7 MPa, breaking strains of 138% to 611%, initial moduli of 3 to 11 Mpa, and suture retention strengths of 35 to 59 MPa. When hydrated, scaffolds were found to contract markedly with 50% dECM content. When used in a rat full-thickness abdominal wall replacement model, no herniation, infection, or tissue adhesion was observed after 4 and 8 weeks with a scaffold containing 25% dECM or a control 100% PEUU scaffold. Scaffolds incorporating dECM were significantly thicker at the time of explant, with greater numbers of associated smooth muscle actin-positive staining cells than in the control, but minimal cellular infiltration and remodeling of the scaffold were detected regardless of dECM addition. The processing of dECM and PEUU from a mixed solution thus provided a scaffold with evidence of better bioactivity and with mechanical properties not achievable with digested dECM alone.', 21937223: 'A combined Fenton-UASB (2 phase)-SBR system was employed to treat acrylic fiber manufacturing wastewater. The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal and effluent Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) to COD were 65.5% and 0.529%, respectively, with the optimal Fenton conditions: ferrous was 300 mg/L; hydrogen peroxide was 500 mg/L; pH was 3.0; reaction time was 2.0 h. In two-phase UASB reactor, mesophilic operation (35±0.5 °C) was performed with hydraulic retention time (HRT) varied between 28 and 40 h. The results showed that with the HRT not less than 38 h, COD and sulfate removal were 65% and 75%, respectively. The greatest sizes of granule formed in the sulfate-reducing and methane-producing phases were 5 and 2 mm, respectively. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) accounted for 35% in the sulfate-reducing phase while methane-producing archaea (MPA) accounted for 72% in the methane-producing phase.

After immobilization, the beads were subjected to freeze-thawing to enhance mechanical strength. When exposed to 80 mg/L Cr(VI), the immobilized bacteria were able to reduce 50% of them in 84 h, however the free cells were deactivated at this concentration. The beads were used to reduce 50 mg/L Cr(VI) for nine times, with the reduction efficiency above 90% in the first five times and 65% in the end.', 21940031: 'A fish farm sludge high in P (2-6% w/w as dry matter), Fe (5-7%), C (40-50%) and N (0.8-4%) was subjected to a series of acid leaching treatments using HCl, organic acids, and biologically mediated acid production. Additions of biodegradable organic acid solubilized heavy metals better than HCl, while additions of 1.5% w/v glucose followed by 7 day incubation stabilized the sludge releasing 92% P, 100% Fe. The use of homo-lactic Lactobacillus plantarum starter cultures were more effective than hetero-lactic Lactobacillus buchneri, solubilizing 81.9% P, 92.2% Fe, 93.0% Zn and 96.4% Ca in the sludge. The anaerobic sludge-glucose fermentation using L. plantarum produced a leached sludge that has low heavy metal and nutrient content while affording the recovery of nutrients. The potential of these methods for practical application are briefly discussed.', 21944284: \"The removal and biodegradation of nonylphenol (NP) by alginate-immobilized cells of Chlorella vulgaris were compared with their respective free cultures. The effects of four cell densities of 10(4) per algal bead were investigated, as were the four algal bead concentrations, with regard to the removal and biodegradation of NP. Although immobilization significantly decreased the growth rate and NP's biodegradation efficiency of C. vulgaris, NP removal over a short period was enhanced. The NP removal mechanism by immobilized cells was similar to that by free cells, including adsorption onto alginate matrix and algal cells, absorption within cells and cellular biodegradation. The optimal cell density and bead concentration for the removal and biodegradation of NP was 50-100×10(4) cells algal bead(-1) and 2-4 beads ml(-1) of wastewater, respectively. These results demonstrated that immobilized C. vulgaris cells under optimal biomass and photoautotrophic conditions are effective in removing NP from contaminated water.\", 21945162: 'For the first time, growing cells of Gordonia alkanivorans RIPI90A were used for biodesulfurization (BDS) of diesel. This process was carried out in an internal airlift bioreactor. BDS parameters (oil/water phase ratio and initial sulfur concentration) were optimized in flasks using response surface methodology. Predicted results were found to be in good agreement with experimental results. Initial sulfur concentration had a remarkable effect on BDS process. Maximum removal of sulfur (21 mg/l) can be achieved at oil/water phase ratio of 25% (v/v) and initial sulfur concentration of 28 mg/l. Moreover, effect of superficial gas velocity (Ug) and working volume (v) on volumetric gas liquid mass transfer coefficient was studied in an airlift bioreactor for BDS of diesel. The best results were achieved at Ug and v of 2.5l/min and 6.6l, respectively. Subsequently, BDS of diesel was investigated in an airlift bioreactor under optimized conditions. Sulfur reduction after 30 h was 14 mg/l.', 21950119: 'A comparative H2O2-luminol- and Fe(II)-induced chemiluminescence analysis of extracts of two strains of marine oil oxidizing bacteria Actinetobacter calcoaceticus cultivated either in the presence or absence of oil was carried out. Effects of these extracts on E. coli MG1655 biosensor (pSoxS-lux) were studied. Activation of H2O2-induced chemiluminescence in the presence of oil was observed. This suggests activation of free radical lipid peroxidation. Aqueous extracts of microorganisms cultivated in the presence of oil were shown to activate reactive oxygen species production (ROS) in Fe(II)-induced chemiluminescence reaction mixture. Acetone-ethanol extracts induced antioxidative systems of both strains. Chemiluminescence analysis in a biological system carried utilizing E. coli MG1655 (pSoxS-lux) revealed that aqueous extracts of the strains cultivated in the absence of oil contained potential antioxidants.', 21955876: 'The in vivo biodegradation of the diazo dye Reactive Black 5 (RB5) by Phanerochaete chrysosporium immobilised on cubes of nylon sponge and on sunflower-seed shells (SS) in laboratory-scale bioreactors was investigated. The SS cultivation led to the best results with a decolouration percentage of 90.3% in 72 h for an initial RB5 concentration of 100 mg/L. It was found that the addition of 0.4 mM veratryl alcohol (VA) into the medium considerably increased the decolouration rate in SS cultivation. However, the addition of VA had no effect in the nylon cultivation. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) revealed that RB5 was transformed into one metabolite after 24 h. UV-vis spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) also confirmed the biodegradation of RB5. Toxicity of RB5 solutions before and after fungal treatment was assayed using Sinorhizobium meliloti as a sensitive soil microorganism. P. chrysosporium transformed the toxic dye RB5 into a non-toxic product.', 21963281: 'Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is useful tool for specific and efficient knockdown of disease-related genes. However, in vivo applications of siRNA are limited due to difficulty in its efficient delivery to target cells. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of a biodegradable hydrogel, poly-d,l-lactic acid-p-dioxanone-polyethylene glycol block co-polymer (PLA-DX-PEG), as a siRNA carrier. PLA-DX-PEG pellets with or without fluorescein-labeled dsRNA were implanted into mouse dosal muscle pouches. The cellular uptake of dsRNA surround the polymer was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy. The fluorescence intensity was dose-dependent of the dsRNA, and exhibited a time-dependent decrease. To investigate its biological efficiency, noggin (antagonoist to BMPs) gene-silencing with siRNA (siRNA/Noggin) was examined by the amount of suppression of BMP-2-induced noggin expression and the level of performance of BMP, indicated by ectopic bone formation. Noggin gene expression induced by BMP-2 was suppressed by addition of siRNA/Noggin to the implant, and the ectopic bone formation induced by implants with both BMP-2 and siRNA/Noggin was significantly greater than those induced by implants with BMP-2 alone. These results indicate the efficacy of local delivery of siRNAs by PLA-DX-PEG polymer, which intensified bone-inducing effects of BMP and promoted new bone formation by suppressing gene expression of Noggin.', 21972223: 'This study proposes a biodegradable nerve conduit containing genipin-cross-linked gelatin annexed with tricalcium phosphate ceramic particles (genipin-gelatin-tricalcium phosphate, GGT) in peripheral nerve regeneration. Firstly, cytotoxicity tests revealed that the GGT-extracts were not toxic, and promoted the proliferation and neuronal differentiation of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs). Secondly, the GGT composite film effectively supported ADSCs attachment and growth. Additionally, the GGT substrate was biocompatible with the neonatal rat sciatic nerve and produced a beneficial effect on peripheral nerve repair through in vitro tissue culture. Finally, the experiments in this study confirmed the effectiveness of a GGT/ADSCs nerve conduit as a guidance channel for repairing a 10-mm gap in a rat sciatic nerve. Eight weeks after implantation, the mean recovery index of compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) was significantly different between the GGT/ADSCs and autografts groups (p < 0.05), both of which were significantly superior to the GGT group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, walking track analysis also showed a significantly higher sciatic function index (SFI) score (p < 0.05) and better toe spreading development in the GGT/ADSCs group than in the autograft group. Histological observations and immunohistochemistry revealed that the morphology and distribution patterns of nerve fibers in the GGT/ADSCs nerve conduits were similar to those of the autografts. The GGT nerve conduit offers a better scaffold for the incorporation of seeding undifferentiated ADSCs, and opens a new avenue to replace autologous nerve grafts for the rapid regeneration of damaged peripheral nerve tissues and an improved approach to patient care.', 21972498: 'Phytoextraction using hyperaccumulating plants is generally time-consuming and requires the cessation of agriculture. We coupled chelators and a co-cropping system to enhance phytoextraction rates, while allowing for agricultural production. An experiment on I m3 lysimeter beds was conducted with a co-cropping system consisting of the hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii and low-accumulating corn (Zea Mays, cv. Huidan-4), with addition ofa mixture of chelators (MC), to assess the efficiency of chelator enhanced co-crop phytoextraction and the leaching risk caused by the chelator. The results showed that the addition of MC promoted the growth of S. alfredii in the first crop (spring-summer season) and significantly increased the metal phytoextraction. The DTPA-extractable and total metal concentrations in the topsoil were also reduced more significantly with the addition of MC compared with the control treatments. However, mono-cropped S. alfredii without MC was more suitable for maximizing S. alfredii growth and therefore phytoextraction of Zn and Cd during the autumn-winter seasons. No adverse impact to groundwater due to MC application was observed during the experiments with three crops and three MC applications. But elevated total Cd and Pb concentrations among subsoils compared to the initial subsoil concentrations were found for the co-crop + MC treatment after the third crop.', 21972500: 'We report here on efforts to show that a combination of native wetland plant species might perform better than a monoculture in wetlands designed for arsenic remediation by supplementing weaknesses. Carex stricta and Spartina pectinata were used in hydroponic experiments. (i) Arsenic uptake was first assessed at two ages via exposure to control or arsenic-laden solutions (0 or 1.5 mg As L(-1) as Na2HAsO4) for two weeks. Age had no significant effect on arsenic concentrations in roots, but translocation factors were greater in older plants of C. stricta and S. pectinata (0.45 and 0.07, respectively) than in younger plants (0.10 and 0.01, respectively). (ii) Seasonal effects were assessed by determining uptake kinetics for both species in conditions representative of spring temperatures (15/5 degrees C) and light regimes (1050 micromol m(-2) s(-1), 13 h day(-1)) and summer temperatures (28/17 degrees C) and light regimes (1300 micromol m(-2) s(-1), 15 h day(-1)). Both species had comparable rates of arsenic uptake into roots in summer conditions (44.0 and 46.5 mg As kg(-1) dry wt. h(-1) in C. stricta and S. pectinata, respectively), but C. stricta had a higher maximum net influx rate in spring conditions (24.5 versus 10.4 mg As kg(-1) dry wt. h(-1)).', 21972512: 'Greenhouse and field trial experiments were performed to evaluate the use of Chromolaena odorata with various soil amendments for phytoextraction of Pb contaminated soil Pb mine soils contain low amount of nutrients, so the additions of organic (cow manure) and inorganic (Osmocote and NH4NO3 and KCl) fertilizers with EDTA were used to enhance plant growth and Pb accumulation. Greenhouse study showed that cow manure decreased available Pb concentrations and resulted in the highest Pb concentration in roots (4660 mg kg(-1)) and shoots (389.2 mg kg(-1)). EDTA increased Pb accumulation in shoots (17-fold) and roots (11-fold) in plants grown in soil with Osmocote with Pb uptake up to 203.5 mg plant(-1). Application of all fertilizers had no significant effects on relative growth rates of C. odorata. Field trial study showed that C. odorata grown in soil with 99545 mg kg(-1) total Pb accumulated up to 3730.2 and 6698.2 mg kg(-1) in shoots and roots, respectively, with the highest phytoextraction coefficient (1.25) and translocation factor (1.18). These results indicated that C. odorata could be used for phytoextraction of Pb contaminated soil. In addition, more effective Pb accumulation could be enhanced by Osmocote fertilizer. However, the use of EDTA in the field should be concerned with their leaching problems.', 21972515: 'Plant growth and lead (Pb) uptake by seven willow varieties were investigated in pot and field experiments to assess the suitability of willows for phytoremediation of Pb at heavily contaminated sites such as skeet ranges. Differences in uptake and translocation of Pb in Salix were observed between pot and field experiments. In the pot experiment, willows grown in Pb-contaminated field soil for 6 months showed tolerance to very high soil Pb concentration (21,360 mg kg(-1)), and with the addition of EDTA were able to take up and translocate more than 1000 mg kg(-1) Pb into above-ground tissues. In the field experiment, all willow varieties showed tolerance to heterogeneously high soil Pb concentrations. Plants were also able to take up and translocate Pb into above-ground tissues. However, after 4.5 months, the lead concentration in the above-ground tissues of willows grown in soil amended with EDTA was less than 200 mg kg(-1). The results from the pot experiment suggest that Salix varieties have the potential to take up and translocate significant amounts of Pb into above-ground tissues using EDTA. However, to verify the phytoextraction abilities of Salix in the field, additional research is needed.', 21972521: 'A well-characterized cadmium (Cd) hyperaccumulating plant Solanum nigrum was grown in Cd and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) co-contaminated soil that was repeatedly amended with chemicals, including EDTA, cysteine (CY), salicylic acid (Sa), and Tween 80 (TW80), to test individual and combined treatment effects on phytoremediation of Cd-PAHs contaminated soils. Plant growth was negatively affected by exogenous chemicals except for EDTA. S. nigrum could accumulate Cd in tissues without assistant chemicals, while there was no visible effect on the degradation of PAHs. Cysteine had significant effects on phytoextraction of Cd and the highest metal extraction ratio (1.27%) was observed in 0.9 mmol/kg CY treatment. Both salicylic acid and Tween 80 had stimulative effects on the degradation of PAHs and there was the maximal degradation rate (52.6%) of total PAHs while 0.9 mmol/kg Sa was applied. Furthermore, the combined treatment T(0.1EDTA+0.9CY+0.5TW80) and T(0.5EDTA+0.9CY+03Sa) could not only increase the accumulation of Cd in plant tissues, but also promote the degradation of PAHs. These results indicated that S. nigrum might be effective in phytoextracting Cd and enhancing the biodegradation of PAHs in the co-contaminated soils with assistant chemicals.', 21974888: 'Pravastatin is one of the first available statins on the market. The purpose of this study was to isolate and identify the quinoline-degrading microorganism from petroleum-contaminated soil that could bioconvert compactin to pravastatin. There were 10,011 microorganism colonies isolated; five strains showed a higher capability for quinoline biodegradation. These five strains were evaluated for their pravastatin bioconversion ability; Pseudonocardia sp. had the highest efficiency for conversion of compactin to pravastatin. The strain was further identified as Pseudonocardia carboxydivorans PAH4. The bioconversion rates were studied under difference incubation conditions. Pre-incubation in medium containing 0.005% compactin sodium, resulted in the compactin utilization rate of almost 100% in a 1mg/ml compactin-containing medium. The rate of conversion of pravastatin was up to 68% after 6 days of incubation. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that P. carboxydivorans PAH4 could be considered a candidate for the production of pravastatin on an industrial scale.', 21992611: 'Water soluble organic compounds (OCs), including naphthenic acids (NAs), are potentially toxic constituents of oil sands process-affected water (OSPW) that is generated during extraction of bitumen from Alberta oil sands. Ozonation can decrease concentrations of OCs in OSPW. However, effects of ozonated-OSPW on multicellular organisms are unknown. A 10-day and a chronic exposure of Chironomus dilutus to OSPW were conducted to assess effects on survival, growth, development, and behavior. Two separate batches of OSPW were treated with 30 or 80 mg ozone (O(3))/L. Wet body masses of larvae exposed to OSPW were 64 to 77% less than their respective controls (p < 0.001). However, both levels of ozonation significantly attenuated effects of OSPW on growth. Similarly, chronic exposure to untreated OSPW resulted in significantly less pupation than in the controls, with 31% and 71% less pupation of larvae exposed to the two batches of OSPW (p < 0.05). Emergence was significantly less for larvae exposed to OSPW, with 13% and 8% of larvae emerging, compared to 81% in controls (p < 0.0001). Both levels of ozonation of OSPW attenuated effects on emergence. These results suggest that OCs degraded by ozonation causes toxicity of OSPW toward C. dilutus, and that ozonation attenuates toxicity of OSPW.', 21996479: 'Reactive azo dyes are considered as one of the most detrimental pollutants from industrial effluents and therefore their biodegradation is receiving constant scientific consideration. A bacterial isolate VS-MH2, originating from dye contaminated sites of Gujarat, India, was exploited for its ability to degrade a synthetic dye mixture (SDM) (comprising of four azo reactive dyes) under static conditions. The identification of the isolate by 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed it to be Comamonas sp. The biodegradation of the SDM was analyzed by UV-vis spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and GC-MS analysis. The isolate showed high metabolic activity towards SDM and degraded it completely (100 mg L(-1)) within 30 h at pH 7 and 35 °C. Simulated microcosm studies in the presence and absence of indigenous microflora confirmed the ability of Comamonas sp. VS-MH2 for dye degradation and to colonize the soil. This is the first investigation reporting the degradation of SDM by Comamonas sp. under simulated soil microcosms.', 22001058: 'The effect of redox mediator has been studied in details in the bio-decolorization processes, but there are little literatures about bioreactor systems with functional bio-carrier modified by redox mediator. Two different bioreactor configurations (bioreactor R1 with functional bio-carrier modified by disperse turquoise blue S-GL (as redox mediator) and bioreactor R2 with non-modified bio-carrier) were designed and tested for disperse scarlet S-BWFL decolorization by Halomonas sp. GYW (EF188281) in this study. Influencing factors such as co-substrate, temperature and pH were optimized through batch experiments. Compared to bioreactor R2, bioreactor R1 exhibited good decolorization efficiency and performance ability for the disperse scarlet S-BWFL decolorization, which showed higher decolorization efficiency (over 96% color removal with 0.8 g L(-1) dye concentration) and less hydraulic retention time to attain the same decolorization efficiency. The combinational technology of redox mediator and bio-carrier was a new bio-treatment concept and a great improvement for the application of redox mediator.', 22019268: 'Two perchlorate-reducing bacterial consortia (PRBC) were obtained by enrichment cultures from polluted marine sediments. Non-salt-tolerant PRBC (N-PRBC) was enriched without the addition of NaCl, and salt tolerant-PRBC (ST-PRBC) was enriched with 30 g-NaCl L(-1). Although the perchlorate reduction rates decreased with increasing NaCl concentration, ST-PRBC (resp., N-PRBC) could reduce perchlorate until 75 g-NaCl L(-1) (resp., 30 g-NaCl L(-1)). The reduction yield (1.34±0.05 mg-perchlorate per mg-acetate) and maximum perchlorate reduction rate (86 mg-perchlorateL(-1) h(-1)) of ST-PRBC was higher than those (1.16±0.03 mg-perchlorate per mg-acetate and 48 mg-perchlorate L(-1) h(-1)) of N-PRBC. Kinetic analysis showed that NaCl acted as an uncompetitive inhibitor against both PRBCs. The inhibition constants were 25 and 41 mg-NaCl L(-1) for N-PRBC and ST-PRBC, respectively.', 22021186: 'Pure magnesium (Mg) was implanted intramedullary into the femur of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats to investigate its effect on bone growth after 6 weeks degradation. The experimental results showed that the femoral BMD in diabetic rats was significantly lower than that in controls (p < 0.01) but restored notably by Mg implantation. The contents of calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), Mg, zinc (Zn), potassium (K), strontium (Sr), and sulfur (S) in bone of diabetic group were significantly lower than those in controls but remarkably increased with implantation of Mg. The residual weight calculation showed that 29.41% of Mg was degraded in vivo. The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis showed that the reaction layer on the surface of the Mg implant mainly consisted of C, Ca, O, P, and Mg. Besides, serum Mg level was significantly decreased in diabetic group compared with the control group but increased by Mg treatment. Also, there were no significant differences in body weight and blood glucose, as well as blood glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAIc%), serum Ca, alanine aminitransperase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), uric acid (UA), nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), cholinesterase (CHE), and creatinine (CR) levels between diabetic and Mg-implanted rats. The study indicated that Mg implant had no obvious toxicity in STZ-induced diabetic rats and may act as a potential agent to treat osteoporosis.', 22030247: 'Copper is an essential element, however, this heavy metal is an inhibitor of microbial activity at relatively low concentrations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of copper(II) towards various microbial trophic groups responsible for the removal of organic constituents and nutrients in wastewater treatment processes. The results of the batch bioassays indicated that copper(II) caused severe inhibition of key microbial populations in wastewater treatment systems. Denitrifying bacteria were found to be very sensitive to the presence of copper(II). The concentrations of copper(II) causing 50% inhibition (IC(50)) on the metabolic activity of denitrifiers was 0.95 mg L(-1). Copper was also inhibitory to fermentative bacteria, aerobic glucose-degrading heterotrophs, and nitrifying bacteria (IC(50) values=3.5, 4.6 and 26.5 mg L(-1), respectively). Nonetheless, denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria showed considerable recovery of their metabolic activity after only several days of exposure to high copper levels (up to 25 and 100mg Cu(II) L(-1) for denitrification and nitrification, respectively). The recovery could be due to attenuation of soluble copper or to microbial adaptation.', 22033308: 'This is the first study to model the effects of nitrate on autohydrogenotrophic perchlorate biokinetics. Batch experiments demonstrated that the presence of nitrate significantly inhibited perchlorate degradation by a hydrogen-oxidizing, perchlorate-reducing microbial consortium. However, the consortium was capable of significant perchlorate reduction while the bulk of the nitrate was still present. Results showed that a modified competitive inhibition model successfully predicted autohydrogenotrophic perchlorate degradation in the presence of nitrate (initial concentrations of ∼230\\xa0μg ClO(4)(-)/L and 2.2-4.6\\xa0mg NO(3)(-)-N/L). The model describes perchlorate degradation as a function of the biomass, perchlorate, hydrogen, and nitrate concentrations, as well as the single-component perchlorate (28\\xa0μg/L), hydrogen (2.3\\xa0×\\xa010(-6)\\xa0M (aq)), and nitrate (0.15\\xa0mg/L as N) half-saturation coefficients (K(s)) and perchlorate maximum substrate utilization rate (k) (1.8\\xa0μg ClO(4)(-)/mg TSS-hr).

A current new approach for such materials consists in injectable biodegradable polymers. Their major advantages are the ability to fill-in defects, easy incorporation of therapeutic agents or cells, and the possibility of minimal invasive surgical procedures. Polycaprolactone (PCL) is a promising biodegradable and elastic biomaterial, with the drawback of low-degradation kinetics in vivo. In this work a biodegradable injectable gel of PCL blended with sebacic acid (SA) was prepared, to improve the degradation rate of the biomaterial. SA is known for its high degradation rate, although in high concentrations it could originate a pH decrease and thus disturb the biocompatibility of PCL. Degradation tests on phosphate buffered saline were carried out using 5% of SA on the blend and the biomaterial stability was evaluated after degradation using differential scanning calorimetry, dynamical mechanical analysis, and scanning electronic microscopy. After degradation the elastic properties of the blend decreased and the material became more crystalline and stiffer, although at a lower extent when compared with pure PCL. The blend also degraded faster with a loss of the crystalline phase on the beginning (30 days), although its thermal and mechanical properties remained comparable with those of the pure material, thus showing that it achieved the intended objectives. After cell assays the PCL-SA gel was shown to be cytocompatible and capable of maintaining high cell viability (over 90%).', 22044603: 'This study focused on the investigation of (i) the tetrachloroethene (PCE) toxicity threshold of a reductively dechlorinating mixed culture containing Dehalococcoides spp., (ii) the adsorption of PCE on different types of granular activated carbon (GAC), and (iii) the bioavailability and reductive dechlorination in the presence of GAC. The abundance of Dehalococcoides spp. detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was found to increase by 2-4 orders of magnitude during degradation of PCE. No degradation occurred at dissolved concentrations beyond 420 μM (70 mg/L). Different adsorption isotherms were determined for thermally and chemically activated carbons. The addition of GAC to biological assays reduced the dissolved PCE concentration below the toxicity threshold. The combination of microbial reductive dechlorination with GAC adsorption proved to be a promising method for remediation of groundwater contaminated by high concentrations of chloroethenes.', 22047658: 'Organic matters in sewage sludge can be converted into volatile fatty acids (VFAs) as renewable carbon sources. This work for the first time applied anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) for enhancing VFA production from sewage sludge. With 0.066 or 0.33 g AQDS g(-1) dried solids (DS), the yields for VFAs peak at 403 or 563 mg l(-1), 1.9- or 2.7-fold to the control. The accumulated VFAs were principally composed of acetate and propionate. The AQDS enhances degradation rates of model proteins (bovine serum albumin), but had little enhancement on that of model polysaccharides (dextrans). The acidification step is proposed the rate-limiting step for VFA production from sewage sludge, in which the AQDS molecules shuttle electrons to accelerate the redox reactions associated with amino acid degradation. Methanogenic activities are inhibited in the presence of AQDS. The AQDS-assisted VFAs are renewable organic carbon sources, although their direct use for anaerobic digestion is not advised.', 22050507: StringElement('To evaluate the effect of an indomethacin-eluting biodegradable urethral stent on the production of inflammatory cytokines in vitro and the degradation and biocompatibility of the new stent in vivo.', attributes={'Label': 'PURPOSE', 'NlmCategory': 'OBJECTIVE'}), 22051550: 'Even at trace levels, arsenic is of environmental and health concern due to its high toxicity. The xerohalophyte plant species Atriplex atacamensis grows on an arsenic-contaminated mining area in North Chile. Young seedlings that were grown from seeds collected from these plants were grown in a nutrient solution under controlled environmental conditions and were exposed for 14 and 28 days to 0, 100 or 1000 μM arsenate. More than 75% of the plants that were exposed to the highest As dose survived until the end of the treatment. The seedling growth was reduced (100 μM As) or inhibited (1000 μM As) in the stress conditions, but the plants were able to efficiently close their stomata and perform osmotic adjustments to avoid secondary water stress. Arsenic accumulated up to 400 μg g(-1) DW in the shoots and 3500 μg g(-1) DW in the roots. Arsenate drastically impaired the P content and increased glycinebetaine content, although no arsenobetaine was found in the tissues. With the exception of arsenite and arsenate, no As-containing organic compound was detected. Arsenic was not excreted by the trichomes that were present at the leaf surface. Although an increase in the total level of non-protein thiols suggested that arsenite fixation on the sulfhydryl groups could occur in the stressed tissues, the majority of the soluble arsenic remained in its oxidized state As(V). Arsenate induced an increase in the free soluble polyamine concentrations in all of the organs, and it increased the proportion of spermidine and spermine and decreased the proportion of putrescine in the polyamine pool. Therefore, it is likely that these polycationic molecules may assist in arsenate sequestration in the stressed tissues, and A. atacamensis may represent a promising plant species that can be tested in field trials for its phytomanagement of As-contaminated sites in desert areas.', 22078227: 'It has been well documented that excess concentrations of boron (B) causes toxic effects on many of the environmental systems. Although Chlorella sp. has been studied to remove pollutants from water, its capacity to remove B has not been investigated yet. Boron removal levels of newly isolated Chlorella sp. were investigated in BG 11 media with stimulators as triacontanol (TRIA) and/or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO(3)) and without them, to test if they could increase the removal efficiency by increasing biomass. The assays were performed to determine the effect of different medial compositions, B concentrations, pH and biomass concentrations onto removal efficiency. Boron removal was investigated at 5-10 mg/L range at pH 8 in different medial compositions and maximum removal yield was found as 32.95% at 5.45 mg/L B in media with TRIA and NaHCO(3). The effect of different pH values on the maximum removal yield was investigated at pH 5-9, and the optimum pH was found again 8. The interactive effect of biomass concentration and B removal yield was also investigated at 0.386-1.061 g wet weight/L biomass. The highest removal yield was found as 38.03% at the highest biomass range. This study highlights the importance of using new isolate Chlorella sp. as a new biomaterial for B removal process of waters containing B.', 22113456: 'The use of irrigation water containing cyanobacterial toxins may generate a negative impact in both yield and quality of agricultural crops causing significant economic losses. We evaluated the effects of microcystins (MC) on the growth, nodulation process and nitrogen uptake of a Faba bean cultivar (Vicia faba L., Fabaceae), particularly the effect of MC on rhizobia-V. faba symbiosis. Three rhizobial strains (RhOF4, RhOF6 and RhOF21), isolated from nodules of local V. faba were tested. The exposure of rhizobia to MC showed that the toxins had a negative effect on the rhizobial growth especially at the highest concentrations of 50 and 100 μg/l. The germination of faba bean seeds was also affected by cyanotoxins. We registered germination rates of 75 and 68.75% at the toxin levels of 50 and 100 μg/l as compared to the control (100%). The obtained results also showed there was a negative effect of MC on plants shoot, root (dry weight) and total number of nodules per plant. Cyanotoxins exposure induced a significant effect on nitrogen assimilation by faba bean seedlings inoculated with selected rhizobial strains RhOF6 and RhOF21, while the effect was not significant on beans seedling inoculated with RhOF4. This behavior of tolerant rhizobia-legumes symbioses may constitute a very important pathway to increase soil fertility and quality and can represent a friendly biotechnological way to remediate cyanotoxins contamination in agriculture.', 22137272: 'A novel magnetically separable laccase immobilized system was constructed by adsorbing laccase into bimodal carbon-based mesoporous magnetic composites (CMMC). A large adsorption capacity (491.7 mg g(-1)), excellent activity recovery (91.0%) and broader pH and temperature profiles than free laccase have been exhibited by the immobilized laccase. Thermal stability was enhanced to a great extent and operational stability was increased to a certain extent. The shift of kinetic parameters indicated affinity change between enzyme and substrate. Application of the immobilized system in phenol and p-chlorophenol removal was investigated in a batch system. Adsorption effects of the support were responsible for the quick removal rate in the first hour, and up to 78% and 84% of phenol and p-chlorophenol were removed in the end of the reaction, respectively, indicating that the magnetic bimodal mesoporous carbon is a promising carrier for both immobilization of laccase and further application in phenol removal.', 22142725: \"Polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) are toxic and persistent organic pollutants that are widely distributed in the environment. Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 is capable of degrading aerobically an unusually wide range of PCBs. However, during PCB-degradation B. xenovorans LB400 generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that affect its viability. The aim of this study was to increase the efficiency of PCB-degradation of B. xenovorans LB400 by adding antioxidant compounds that could increase tolerance to oxidative stress. The effect of antioxidant compounds on the growth, morphology and PCB-degradation by B. xenovorans LB400 was evaluated. α-Tocopherol or vitamin E (vitE) and berry extract (BE) increased slightly the growth of strain LB400 on biphenyl, whereas in presence of ascorbic acid or vitamin C (vitC) an inhibition of growth was observed. The growth of B. xenovorans LB400 in glucose was inhibited by the addition of 4-chlorobiphenyl (4-CB). Interestingly, in presence of α-tocopherol the growth of strain LB400 was less affected by 4-CB. By transmission electronic microscopy it was observed that α-tocopherol preserved the cell membranes and improved cell integrity of glucose-grown LB400 cells exposed to 4-CB, suggesting a protective effect of α-tocopherol. Notably, α-tocopherol increased biphenyl and 4-CB degradation by B. xenovorans LB400 in an aqueous solution. The effect of antioxidants compounds on PCB-bioremediation was evaluated in agricultural soil spiked with 2-chlorobiphenyl (2-CB), 4-CB and 2,4'-chlorobiphenyl (2,4'-CB). For bioaugmentation, LB400 cells grown on biphenyl and subsequently incubated with pyruvate were added to the soil. Native soil microbiota was able to remove PCBs. Bioaugmentation with strain LB400 increased strongly the PCB-degradation rate. Bioaugmentation with strain LB400 and biostimulation with α-tocopherol or berry extract increased further the PCB degradation. Half-life of 2,4'-CB decreased by bioaugmentation from 24 days to 4 days and by bioaugmentation in presence of α-tocopherol and berry extract to 2 days. By bioaugmentation with strain LB400, 85% of 2,4'-CB was degraded in 20 days, whereas bioaugmentation with strain LB400 and biostimulation with α-tocopherol or berry extract reduced the time to less than 13 days. This indicates that antioxidant compounds stimulated PCB-degradation in soil. Therefore, the addition of antioxidant compounds constitutes an attractive strategy for the scale-up of aerobic PCB-bioremediation processes.\", 22142726: 'Due to their low substrate specificity, fungal laccases have a great potential in industrial applications, including the bioremediation of colored wastewaters from textile industry. However, the presence of halides in these effluents (up to 1M NaCl) which inhibit laccases is a drawback for bioremediation processes. In order to develop an efficient enzymatic remediation process for textile dye effluent, the possibility to reduce this halide inhibition is conditioned by a better understanding of the phenomenon. The present study gives a detailed account of the kinetics of chloride inhibition of both ABTS (a model substrate) and ABu62 (an anthraquinonic acid dye) oxidations catalyzed by Trametes versicolor laccase (LacIIIb). Chloride inhibition can be described by a mixed model for ABTS and a non-competitive model for ABu62 and both inhibitions are linear suggesting a single inhibitory site for chloride. Experiments were also conducted in presence of both substrates. An apparent activation of laccase was observed in the presence of ABu62 leading to an enhancement of the oxidation rate of ABTS. The extent of activation increased in the presence of chloride anions. Finally, for the first time to our knowledge, we evidenced that inhibition of ABTS oxidation by chloride can be reduced in the presence of ABu62.', 22169216: 'A highly efficient and stable biocatalyst (denoted D201_Lac) was fabricated by encapsulating Trametes versicolor laccase within a macroporous and strongly basic exchange resin D201 through a simple adsorption process. Transmission electron micrographs and Fourier transform infrared spectra of the resultant D201_Lac proved that nanosized laccase clusters were embedded into the inner nano-pores/channels of D201. As compared to the free laccase, D201_Lac showed enhanced resistance in the pH range of 3-7 or at temperature of 30-60°C. Besides, negligible laccase was leached out from the host polymer D201 in solution of pH 3-7 and NaCl concentration up to 0.5M, which might be attributed to the electrostatic attraction and the possible twining between long-chain laccase and the cross-linking host resin. Continuous seven-cycle batch decoloration of malachite green demonstrates that decoloration efficiency of D201_Lac kept constant for more than 320-h operation.', 22177029: 'Manipulation of soil pH by soil additives and / or rhizosphere processes may enhance the efficiency of metal phytoextraction. Here we report on the effect of nitric acid additions to four polluted soils on Cd and Zn concentrations in soil solution (C(soln)) and 0.005M Ca(NO(3))(2) extracts, and related changes in the diffusive fluxes and resupply of the metals as assessed by diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT). The responses of these chemical indicators of bioavailability were compared to metal uptake in two indicator plant species, common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale F.H. Wigg) and narrow leaf plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.) grown for 75days in a pot experiment. Lowering soil pH increased C(soln), the 0.005M Ca(NO(3))(2)-soluble fractions and the DGT-measured Cd and Zn concentrations (C(DGT)) in the experimental soils. This was associated with enhanced uptake of Cd and Zn on soils acidified to pH 4.5 whereas plants did not survive at pH 3.5. Toxicity along with decreased kinetics of metal resupply (calculated by the 2D DIFS model) in the strong acidification treatment suggests that moderate acidification is more appropriate to enhance the phytoextraction process. Each of the chemical indicators of bioavailability predicted well (R(2)>0.70) the Cd and Zn concentrations in plantain shoots but due to metal toxicity not for dandelion. Concentration factors, i.e. the ratio between metal concentrations in shoots and in soil solution (CF) indicate that Cd and Zn uptake in plantain was not limited by diffusion which may explain that DGT did not perform better than C(soln). However, DGT is expected to predict plant uptake better in diffusion-limited conditions such as in the rhizosphere of metal-accumulating phytoextraction crops.', 22178304: 'The paper describes the aerobic degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ), an anti-epileptic drug widely found in aquatic environment, from Erlenmeyer flask to bioreactor by the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor. In Erlenmeyer flask, CBZ at approximately 9\\xa0mg\\xa0L(-1) was almost completely eliminated (94%) after 6\\xa0d, while at near environmentally relevant concentrations of 50\\xa0μg\\xa0L(-1), 61% of the contaminant was degraded in 7\\xa0d. Acridone, acridine, 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-CBZ, and 10, 11-epoxy-CBZ were identified as major metabolites, confirming the degradation of CBZ. The degradation process was then carried out in an air pulsed fluidized bioreactor operated in batch and continuous mode. Around 96% of CBZ was removed after 2 days in batch mode operation, and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-epoxycarbamazepine was found as unique metabolite. In bioreactor operated in continuous mode with a hydraulic retention time of 3\\xa0d, 54% of the inflow concentration (approx. 200\\xa0μg\\xa0L(-1)) was reduced at the steady state (25\\xa0d) with a CBZ degradation rate of 11.9\\xa0μg\\xa0CBZ\\xa0g(-1) dry weight d(-1). No metabolite was detected in the culture broth. Acute toxicity tests (Microtox) indicated that the final culture broth in both batch and continuous mode operation were non toxic, with 15\\xa0min EC50 values of 24% and 77%, respectively.', 22178439: 'Silver nanoparticles (SNPs) are being increasingly used in many consumer products and industrial application. The release of SNPs to the environment is a major concern. Here we have studied the adsorptive removal of SNPs by a SNP resistant bacterial species Aeromonas punctata, isolated from the sewage environment. The influence of zeta potential on adsorption was investigated at acidic, neutral and alkaline pH and with varying salt (NaCl) concentrations. The rate of adsorption and removal of SNPs was decreases with increase in pH and salt concentration. The zeta potential study suggests that, the adsorption of SNPs on the cell surface was related to electrostatic force of attraction. The equilibrium adsorption isotherm and kinetics of adsorption were also studied. The adsorption equilibrium isotherms fitted well to the Langmuir model. The kinetics of adsorption fitted best to pseudo-first-order. A. punctata was able to remove 4.42 and 3.85 mg/L of SNPs at pH 5 and 7 respectively. The present study can be used for the effective removal of SNPs which is released into the environment and sewage treatment systems.', 22192097: StringElement('To investigate in vitro whether pH ranging between 6 and 9 has an effect on the degradation of stent fibers made of poly(l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) 80/20.', attributes={'Label': 'PURPOSE', 'NlmCategory': 'OBJECTIVE'}), 22197331: 'Immobilization is a fundamental method to improve both enzyme activity and stability. In the present work, the process previously described for immobilizing laccase - an enzyme oxidizing phenolic compounds - onto fumed silica was optimized, in order to efficiently produce industrially relevant amounts of a nanobiocatalyst for biological micropollutant elimination, whilst saving 80% of surface modification agent (3-aminopropyl triethoxy silane) and 90% of cross-linker (glutaraldehyde). Minimized losses during preparation and favorable effects of immobilization yielded conjugates with drastically increased enzymatic activity (164% of invested activity). Long-term stability and activity regarding bisphenol A (2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane) removal of the synthesized biocatalyst were assessed under application-relevant conditions. With 81.1±0.4% residual activity after 7 days, stability of conjugates was drastically higher than of free laccase, which showed virtually no activity after 1.5 days. These results illustrate the huge potential of fumed silica nanoparticles/laccase-composites for innovative biological wastewater treatment.', 22197337: 'A simple alkaline pre-treatment of Cupressus sempervirens cone chips was performed to improve their biosorption capacity towards methylene blue and rhodamine B from aqueous solutions, in batch and continuous modes. Biosorption kinetics were determined from single and binary dyes solutions, and properly described by the pseudo-second-order rate model. Experimental single-dye equilibrium isotherms fitted the Langmuir-Freundlich model, with maximum biosorption capacities of 0.68mmol/g for methylene blue and 0.50mmol/g for rhodamine B. Single-dye dynamic biosorption showed that breakthrough time for methylene blue biosorption was almost four times longer than for rhodamine B and that the alkaline modification of the chips greatly improved the biosorption performance. Competitive dynamic biosorption demonstrated the preference of the modified cone chips for biosorbing methylene blue, confirmed by the exit concentration overshoots obtained in the breakthrough curves of rhodamine B.', 22204889: 'The monosodium glutamate (MSG) wastewater as a medium was treated by Lipomyces starkeyi to produce microbial lipid in the study. The effect of related factors (initial glucose concentration, inoculation concentration, initial culture pH, and cultivation time) on biomass, lipid production and lipid content was discussed, respectively. According to the experiments, the optimal fermentation conditions were determined: addition of 80g/L glucose, 10% inoculation concentration, initial pH about 5.0, incubation time 96h. Under this condition, the biomass production reached up to 4.61g/L, lipid production and lipid content was 1.14g/L and 24.73%, respectively. Simultaneously, protein and COD removal rate was 78.60% and 74.96%, respectively. The main composition of fatty acid in the resultant lipid was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, which showed: oleic acid (C18:1) 35.85%, palmitic acid (C16:0) 19.91%, palmitoleic acid (C16:1) 17.65%, and myristic acid (C14:0) 16.03%.', 22206917: 'In the present study, the microbial diversity in anaerobic reactors, continuously exposed to oleate, added to a manure reactor influent, was investigated. Relative changes in archaeal community were less remarkable in comparison to changes in bacterial community indicating that dominant archaeal composition remained relatively stable. Majority of the analyzed bacterial amplicons were phylogenetically affiliated with uncultured bacteria belonging to Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Thermotogae phyla. Bacterial community changes in response to oleate addition resulted in a less diverse bacterial consortium related to functional specialization of the species towards oleate degradation. For the archaeal domain, the sequences were affiliated within Euryarchaeota phylum with three major groups (Methanosarcina, Methanosaeta and Methanobacterium genera). Results obtained in this study deliver a comprehensive picture on oleate degrading microbial communities in high organic strength wastewater. The findings might be utilized for development of strategies for biogas production from lipid-riched wastes.', 22209260: 'Aerobic granular sludge from a lab-scale reactor with simultaneous nitrification/denitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal processes exhibited significant amount of ammonium adsorption (1.5 mg NH4+-N/g TSS at an ammonium concentration of 30 mg N/L). Potassium release accompanied ammonium adsorption, indicating an ion exchange process. The existence of potassium magnesium phosphate (K-struvite) as one of potassium sources in the granular sludge was studied by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD). Artificially prepared K-struvite was indeed shown to adsorb ammonium. Alginate-like exopolysaccharides were isolated and their inducement for struvite formation was investigated as well. Potassium magnesium phosphate proved to be a major factor for ammonium adsorption on the granular sludge. Struvites (potassium/ammonium magnesium phosphate) accumulate in aerobic granular sludge due to inducing of precipitation by alginate-like exopolysaccharides.', 22209276: 'Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs, nanosilver) entering the sewers and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are mostly accumulated in the sludge. In this study, we determined the impact of AgNPs on anaerobic glucose degradation, sludge digestion and methanogenic assemblages. At ambient (22 °C) and mesophilic temperatures (37 °C), there was no significant difference in biogas and methane production between the sludge treated with AgNPs at the concentrations up to 40 mg Ag/L (13.2 g silver/Kg biomass COD) and the control. In these anaerobic digestion samples, acetate and propionic acid were the only detectable volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and they were depleted in 3 days. On the other hand, more than 90% of AgNPs was removed from the liquid phase and associated with the sludge while almost no silver ions were released from AgNPs under anaerobic conditions. Quantitative PCR results indicated that Methanosaeta and Methanomicrobiales were the dominant methanogens, and the methanogenic diversity and population remained largely unchanged after nanosilver exposure and anaerobic digestion. The results suggest that AgNPs at moderate concentrations (e.g., ≤40 mg/L) have negligible impact on anaerobic digestion and methanogenic assemblages because of little to no silver ion release.', 22209278: 'In this study, the influence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) composition and quantity was explored for biosorption of natural organic matter (NOM), using variants of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida. Model EPS (sodium alginate beads) were tested and sorption capacity for NOM was also elucidated. In the absence of divalent ions, minimal NOM biosorption was observed and differences among strains were negligible. Under presence of divalent ions, biosorption of NOM was proportional to the amount of EPS secreted by P. aeruginosa variants. For sorption tests with model EPS, divalent ions also promoted biosorption of tested NOM, and total biosorption was also proportional to alginate quantity. Carboxyl group content in both alginate EPS and NOM appeared to be linked to increased biosorption via bridging with divalent ions. The alginate overproducing strain possessed more potential NOM biosorption sites, while the wild-type and alginate deficient strains possessed fewer potential binding sites. In comparison, P. putida, secreting protein-based EPS, behaved differently for NOM biosorption, due to its hydrophobicity and the structural characteristics of proteins. Hydrophobic interactions appeared to enhance the biosorption of more hydrophobic Suwannee River humic acid by P. putida, whose biosorption of more hydrophilic NOM variants was similar to the alginate deficient strain. Mechanistically, the presence of a diffuse electrical double layer will present potential energy barriers limiting biosorption; however, divalent ion concentrations in the aquatic environment will promote biosorption processes, permitting functional group interactions between EPS and NOM. Bridging between hydrophilic carboxyl groups on alginate EPS and NOM appeared to be the dominant form of biosorption, while hydrophobic interactions enhanced biosorption for protein-based EPS.', 22209372: 'Phytoremediation of waters by aquatic organisms such as algae has been recently explored for the removal of organic pollutants possessing endocrine disrupting capacity. Monoraphidium braunii, a green alga known for rapid growth and good tolerance to different natural organic matter (NOM) qualities, was tested in this study for the ability to tolerate and remove the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A at concentrations of 2, 4 and 10mgL(-1), either in NOM-free or NOM-containing media. NOM at concentrations of 2, 5 and 20mgL(-1) of DOC, was added because it may interfere with xenobiotics and modify their effects, modulate algal growth performances or produce a trade-off of both effects. After 2 and 4 days of algal growth, the cell number and size, the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II in the dark or light adapted state, and the chlorophyll a content were recorded in order to evaluate the algal response to bisphenol A. Moreover, the residual bisphenol A was measured in the algal cultures by chromatographic technique. Results indicated that after 2 and 4 days bisphenol A at the lower concentrations was not toxic for alga, whereas at the highest concentration it reduced algal growth and photosynthetic efficiency. The sole NOM and its combinations with bisphenol A at the lower concentrations increased the cell number and the chlorophyll a content of algae. After 4-day growth, good removal efficiency was exerted by M. braunii at concentrations of 2, 4 and 10mgL(-1) removing, respectively, 39%, 48% and 35% of the initial bisphenol A. Lower removal percentages were found after 2-day growth in the different treatments. NOM at any concentration scarcely influenced the bisphenol A removal. On the basis of data obtained, the use of M. braunii could be reasonably recommended for the phytoremediation of aquatic environments from bisphenol A.', 22236829: 'To obtain controllable stepwise biodegradable polymer for multifunctional antitumor drug carriers, pH-sensitive biodegradable polyurethanes were firstly synthesized using poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and pH-sensitive poly(ε-caprolactone)-hydrazone-poly(ethylene glycol)-hydrazone-poly(ε-caprolactone) macrodiol (PCLH) as soft segment; l-lysine ethyl ester diisocyanate (LDI), l-lysine derivative tripeptide and 1,4-butandiol (BDO) as hard segment; and hydrazone-linked methoxyl-poly(ethylene glycol)(m-PEG-Hyd) as end-capper. Then, an extensive degradation process of the prepared pH-sensitive polyurethanes was investigated in\\xa0vitro with proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra ((1)H NMR), gel permeation chromatograph (GPC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and weight loss. It was found that the degradation of these polyurethanes occurred via the random hydrolytic ester cleavage along the PCL segments close to PEG segments in enzymatic solutions while the hydrazone bond in the polymer chain was more easily cleaved in acidic media, which was accelerated with decreasing pH value. Furthermore, the biocompatibility in\\xa0vivo was evaluated in an intramuscular implantation model on Sprague-Dawley rats, using SEM and light microscopy. The result showed that the prepared polyurethanes can be easily degraded and the degradation products do not induce any adverse response from surrounding muscle tissues. Our work suggests that the prepared pH-sensitive polyurethanes could be promising materials as controllable biodegradable and non-cyctotoxic multifunctional carriers for active intracellular drug delivery.', 22236830: 'There is great demand for constructing well-organized three-dimensional (3D) tissues in vitro. Here, we developed a 3D stacked culture method using biodegradable poly(d,l-lactide-co- glycolide) (PLGA) membranes with defined topography. Pore size and porosity of the membranes can be controlled by changing the moisture content during fabrication. The optimized membrane served as a scaffold to manipulate small hepatocyte (SH) layers when they were stacked, while it degraded after stacking, resulting in the reorganization of the cells into a 3D stacked structure. Immunofluorescent staining for domain markers of cell polarity and electron microscopy confirmed that the cells in the 3D stacked structures recovered polarity. Furthermore, the cells exhibited improved liver-specific function as compared with cells in a monolayer. This 3D stacked culture may enable reconstruction of multilayered hepatic tissues with highly differentiated functions in vitro.', 22240204: \"Cages and fertilizers were used at Glover's Atoll, Belize to test the relative importance of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to microbial euendolithic communities (bacteria, algae and fungi) and their bioerosion rates of Strombus gigas shells after 56-days of exposure. By the end of the experiment, the abundance of green algae was higher than cyanobacteria and fungi in N and N+P treatments, although green algae did not increase proportionally with increasing N concentrations, suggesting that green algae were co-limited by P and N. In contrast, cyanobacteria abundance increased with increasing P concentration, suggesting that cyanobacteria were P-limited. Fungi were not significantly affected by the addition of nutrients. Microbioerosion rates in the N and N+P treatments were 2-times greater than rates in the P treatment and 15-times greater than the control treatment. Results demonstrate that increased nutrient concentrations on coral reefs may increase microbioerosion rates, and variations in nutrient ratios can modify microborers community composition.\", 22243800: 'After spinal cord injury (SCI), loss of cells and damage to ascending and descending tracts can result in paralysis. Current treatments for SCI are based on patient stabilization, and much-needed regenerative therapies are still under development. To activate and instruct stem and progenitor cells or injured tissue to aid SCI repair, it is important to modify the injury environment for a protracted period, to allow time for cell activation, proliferation and appropriate fate differentiation. Shh plays a critical role in spinal cord formation, being involved in multiple processes: it promotes production of motor neurons and oligodendrocytes from ventral cord progenitor cells and serves as an axon guidance molecule. Hence Shh is a candidate pleiotropic beneficial environmental factor for spinal cord regeneration. Here we show that administration of biodegradable microspheres that provide sustained, controlled delivery of Shh resulted in significant functional improvement in two different mouse models of SCI: contusion and dorsal hemioversection. The mechanism is multifactorial, involving increased proliferation of endogenous NG2+ oligodendrocyte lineage cells, decreased astrocytic scar formation and increased sprouting and growth of corticospinal (CST) and raphespinal tract (RST) fibers. Thus, long-term administration of Shh is a potential valuable therapeutic intervention for SCI.', 22245864: 'The widely used explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) has residues that are potentially explosive, toxic, and mutagenic. TNT and other explosives can be degraded by microorganisms; however, biostimulation is needed for process efficiency. To investigate the effectiveness of using biostimulation to degrade TNT, we added varying concentrations of a nutrient amendment consisting of inorganic salts, plant extracts, and molasses to soil and liquid media. For the inoculum we used a consortium of bacteria AM 06 that had exhibited the ability to degrade TNT and which had been previously isolated from explosives-contaminated soils. Phylogenetically, the clones clustered into seven different genera: Klebsiella, Raoultella, Serratia, Stenotrophomonas, Pseudoxanthomonas, Achromobacter and Pseudomonas. The addition of AM 06 consortium to a liquid environment along with 100% nutrient amendment decreased the amount of TNT (and its degradation products) by up to 90% after 14 days incubation. At the total amount of TNT was less than 100 mg/l, the concentration of TNT did not influence the amount of sugar consumed by the bacteria consortium. In soil media, the TNT degradation process was dependent on the concentration of nutrient amendment added. At higher initial concentrations of TNT (500 mg/kg), bioaugmentation (i.e., addition of bacteria inoculum) had a demonstrated effect, especially when nutrient concentrations of 50% and 100% were added to the soil. Findings of this study could further the understanding of the TNT biodegradation processes in water and soil and provide for optimization of the technological conditions for bioremediation.', 22265252: 'Cork manufacturing is a traditional industry in Southern Europe, being the main application of this natural product in wine stoppers and insulation. Cork processing begins at boiling the raw material. As a consequence, great volumes of dark wastewaters, with elevated concentrations of chlorophenols, are generated, which must be depurated through costly physicochemical procedures before discarding them into public water courses. This work explores the potential of bacteria, isolated from cork-boiling waters storage ponds, in bioremediation of the same effluent. The bacterial population present in cork-processing wastewaters was analysed by DGGE; low bacterial biodiversity was found. Aerobic bacteria were isolated and investigated for their tolerance against phenol and two chlorophenols. The most tolerant strains were identified by sequencing 16S rDNA. The phenol-degrading capacity was investigated by determining enzyme activities of the phenol-degrading pathway. Moreover, the capacity to form biofilms was analysed in a microtitre plate assay. Finally, the capacity to form biofilms onto the surface of residual small cork particles was evaluated by acridine staining followed by epifluorescence microscopy and by SEM. A low-cost bioremediation system, using phenol-degrading bacteria immobilised onto residual cork particles (a by-product of the industry) is proposed for the remediation of this industrial effluent (self-bioremediation).', 22270690: 'The mechanisms occurring in a photolytic circulating-bed biofilm reactor (PCBBR) treating 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) were investigated using batch experiments following three protocols: photodegradation alone (P), biodegradation alone (B), and intimately coupled photodegradation and biodegradation (P&B). Initially, the ceramic particles used as biofilm carriers rapidly adsorbed TCP, particularly in the B experiments. During the first 10 min, the TCP removal rate for P&B was equal to the sum of the rates for P and B, and P&B continued to have the greatest TCP removal, with the TCP concentration approaching zero only in the P&B experiments. When phenol, an easily biodegradable compound, was added along with TCP in order to promote TCP mineralization by means of secondary utilization, P&B was superior to P and B in terms of mineralization of TCP, giving 95% removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD). The microbial communities, examined by clone libraries, changed dramatically during the P&B experiments. Whereas Burkholderia xenovorans, a known degrader of chlorinated aromatics, was the dominant strain in the TCP-acclimated inoculum, it was replaced in the P&B biofilm by strains noted for biofilm formation and biodegrading non-chlorinated aromatics.', 22277209: 'The present study is focused on dextranase from Streptomyces sp. NK458 with potential to remove dextran formed during sugar manufacture. The dextranase had molecular weight of 130 kDa and hydrolyzed 15-25 and 410 kDa dextran. Dextranase production was optimized using statistical designs and the enzyme was purified 1.8-fold with 55.5% recovery. It displayed maximum activity at pH 9.0 and 60°C and was stable over a wide range of pH from 5.0 to 10.0. The k(m) and V(max) values were 3.05 mM and 17.97 mmol/ml/h, respectively. Ten units of dextranase could reduce dextran content by 67% in 24h and 56% in 72 h from sugarcane juice of cane variety CoS 86032. The enzyme was stable up to 3 days at 30°C beyond which its activity decreased and dextran removal could be retained by supplementation of 5 U of dextranase. These properties make it a promising biocatalyst for sugar industry.', 22284913: 'Agricultural activity generates two types of waste: firstly, biodegradable organic effluents generally treated by biological processes and, secondly, phytosanitary effluents which contain residues of plant protection products. The latter are collected and treated. Current technological solutions are essentially based on concentration or physical-chemical processes. However, recent improvements in the biodegradability of pesticides open the way to the consideration of alternative, biological, treatment using mixed liquor from wastewater plant activated sludge. The feasibility of the biological treatment of viticultural effluents has been evaluated by the application of pesticides to activated sludge. The necessity for selection of a pesticide-resistant biomass has been highlighted. The elimination of the phytosanitary products shows the potential of a resistant biomass in the treatment of pesticides. The aerated biological storage ponds at three wineries, followed by a sand or reed-bed filter, were used for the treatment of the total annual volume of the viticulture effluents and validate the laboratory experiments. The results show that the biological purification of pesticides by activated sludge is possible by allowing approximately 8 days for biomass adaptation. Stability of purification occurs between 20 and 30 days.', 22286267: 'The effect of the addition of compatible solutes (ectoine and trehalose) on the denitrification process of saline wastewater was studied. In saline wastewater, it was observed that the initial concentration of nitrates was 500 mg N l⁻¹. A fatty substance isolated from oiled bleaching earth (waste of vegetable oil refining process) was used as a source of carbon.The consortium, which was responsible for the denitrification process originated from the wastewater of the vegetable oil industry. The consortium of microorganisms was identified by the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S rRNA gene amplicons and sequencing techniques. It was noted that ectoine affects significantly the activity of lipase and nitrate reductase, and resulted in faster denitrification compared to saline wastewater with the addition of trehalose or control saline wastewater (without compatible solutes). It was observed that relative enzyme activities of lipase and nitrate reductase increased by 32 and 35%, respectively, in the presence of 1 mM ectoine. This resulted in an increase in specific nitrate reduction rate in the presence of 1 mM ectoine to 5.7 mg N g⁻¹ VSS h⁻¹, which was higher than in the absence of ectoine (3.2 mg N g⁻¹ VSS h⁻¹). The addition of trehalose did not have an effect on nitrate removals. Moreover, it was found that trehalose was used up completely by bacteria as a source of carbon in the denitrification process. The fatty acids were biodegraded by 74% in the presence of 1 mM ectoine.', 22297047: 'Electrogenic activity of photo-bioelectrocatalytic /photo-biological fuel cell (PhFC) was evaluated in a mixotrophic mode under anoxygenic microenvironment using photosynthetic consortia as biocatalyst. An acetate rich wastewater was used as anolyte for harnessing energy along with additional treatment. Mixotrophic operation facilitated good electrogenic activity and wastewater treatment associated with biomass growth. PhFC operation documented feasible microenvironment for the growth of photosynthetic bacteria compared to algae which was supported by pigment (total chlorophyll and bacteriochlorophyll) and diversity analysis. Pigment data also illustrated the association between bacterial and algal species. The synergistic interaction between anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthesis was found to be suitable for PhFC operation. Light dependent deposition of electrons at electrode was relatively higher compared to dark dependent electron deposition under anoxygenic condition. PhFC documented for good volatile fatty acids removal by utilizing them as electron donor. Bioelectrochemical behavior of PhFC was evaluated by voltammetric and chronoamperometry analysis.', 22302594: 'Diesel is a widely distributed pollutant. Bioremediation of this kind of compounds requires the use of microorganisms able to survive and adapt to contaminated environments. Pseudomonas extremaustralis is an Antarctic bacterium with a remarkable survival capability associated to polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) production. This strain was used to investigate the effect of cell growth conditions--in biofilm versus shaken flask cultures--as well as the inocula characteristics associated with PHAs accumulation, on diesel degradation. Biofilms showed increased cell growth, biosurfactant production and diesel degradation compared with that obtained in shaken flask cultures. PHA accumulation decreased biofilm cell attachment and enhanced biosurfactant production. Degradation of long-chain and branched alkanes was observed in biofilms, while in shaken flasks only medium-chain length alkanes were degraded. This work shows that the PHA accumulating bacterium P. extremaustralis can be a good candidate to be used as hydrocarbon bioremediation agent, especially in extreme environments.', 22302595: 'This study focuses on the biodegradation of difluorobenzenes (DFBs), compounds commonly used as intermediates in the industrial synthesis of various pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals. A previously isolated microbial strain (strain F11), identified as Labrys portucalensis, able to degrade fluorobenzene (FB) as sole carbon and energy source, was tested for its capability to degrade 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-DFB in batch cultures. Strain F11 could use 1,3-DFB as a sole carbon and energy source, with quantitative release of fluoride, but 1,4-DFB was only degraded and defluorinated when FB was supplied simultaneously. Growth of strain F11 with 0.5 mM of 1,3-DFB led to stoichiometric release of fluoride ion. The same result was obtained in cultures fed with 1 mM of 1,3-DFB or 0.5 mM of 1,4-DFB, in the presence of 1 mM of FB. No growth occurred with 1,2-DFB as substrate, and degradation of FB was inhibited when supplied simultaneously with 1,2-DFB. To our knowledge, this is the first time biodegradation of 1,3-DFB as a sole carbon and energy source, and cometabolic degradation of 1,4-DFB, by a single bacterium, is reported.', 22302596: 'Environmental biodegradation of several chlorinated pesticides is limited by their low solubility and sorption to soil surfaces. To mitigate this problem we quantified the effect of three biosurfactant viz., rhamnolipid, sophorolipid and trehalose-containing lipid on the dissolution, bioavailability, and biodegradation of HCH-isomers in liquid culture and in contaminated soil. The effect of biosurfactants was evaluated through the critical micelle concentration (CMC) value as determined for each isomer. The surfactant increased the solubilization of HCH isomers by 3-9 folds with rhamnolipid and sophorolipid being more effective and showing maximum solubilization of HCH isomers at 40 μg/mL, compared to trehalose-containing lipid showing peak solubilization at 60 μg/mL. The degradation of HCH isomers by Sphingomonas sp. NM05 in surfactant-amended liquid mineral salts medium showed 30% enhancement in 2 days as compared to degradation in 10 days in the absence of surfactant. HCH-spiked soil slurry incubated with surfactant also showed around 30-50% enhanced degradation of HCH which was comparable to the corresponding batch culture experiments. Among the three surfactants, sophorolipid offered highest solubilization and enhanced degradation of HCH isomers both in liquid medium and soil culture. The results of this study suggest the effectiveness of surfactants in improving HCH degradation by increased bioaccessibility.', 22309093: 'Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is generally thought to lower metal bioavailability in aquatic systems due to the formation of metal-DOM complexes that reduce free metal ion concentrations. However, this model may not be pertinent for metal nanoparticles, which are now understood to be ubiquitous, sometimes dominant, metal species in the environment. The influence of DOM on Hg bioavailability to microorganisms was examined under conditions (0.5-5.0 nM Hg and 2-10 μM sulfide) that favor the formation of β-HgS(s) (metacinnabar) nanoparticles. We used the methylation of stable-isotope enriched (201)HgCl(2) by Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132 in short-term washed cell assays as a sensitive, environmentally significant proxy for Hg uptake. Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) and Williams Lake hydrophobic acid (WLHPoA) substantially enhanced (2- to 38-fold) the bioavailability of Hg to ND132 over a wide range of Hg/DOM ratios (9.4 pmol/mg DOM to 9.4 nmol/mg DOM), including environmentally relevant ratios. Methylmercury (MeHg) production by ND132 increased linearly with either SRHA or WLHPoA concentration, but SRHA, a terrestrially derived DOM, was far more effective at enhancing Hg-methylation than WLHPoA, an aquatic DOM dominated by autochthonous sources. No DOM-dependent enhancement in Hg methylation was observed in Hg-DOM-sulfide solutions amended with sufficient l-cysteine to prevent β-HgS(s) formation. We hypothesize that small HgS particles, stabilized against aggregation by DOM, are bioavailable to Hg-methylating bacteria. Our laboratory experiments provide a mechanism for the positive correlations between DOC and MeHg production observed in many aquatic sediments and wetland soils.', 22324781: 'The ability of biomaterials to support the adhesion of cells is a necessary condition for their use in scaffold-guided tissue engineering. Waveguide evanescent field fluorescence (WEFF) microscopy is a relatively new microscopic technique that allows the number of cell adhesions to a waveguide surface be measured by imaging the interfacial contact region between the cells and their substratum. In this work, the adhesion of human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMCs) to ultrathin films (20 nm) of poly(ester amide)s (PEAs) prepared by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technology on waveguides was investigated and compared with conventional vinculin immunostaining on solvent cast PEA films. Cell culture was conducted both in the presence and absence of serum to evaluate the effect of nonspecific protein adsorption that mediates cell adhesion. WEFF microscopy analyses revealed that the cationic PEA enhanced the number of attachment sites compared with the control waveguides regardless of the culture medium. Although differences in cell adhesions between different PEAs were suggested by the results, no statistically significant differences were found. Similar results were observed with presently and previously reported vinculin immunostaining studies, further validating the use of WEFF microscopy to quantify cell adhesions. Moreover, the focal adhesions of the HCASMCs to the PEA surfaces indicate these PEAs can promote integrin signaling, which is vital in cell survival, migration, and proliferation, and ultimately in scaffold-guided vascular tissue engineering.', 22345081: 'This study aimed to develop a practical three-dimensional (3D) macroporous scaffold from aligned electrospun nanofibrous yarns for bone tissue engineering. A novel 3D unwoven macroporous nanofibrous (MNF) scaffold was manufactured with electrospun poly(L-lactic acid) and polycaprolactone (w/w 9:1) nanofibers through sequential yarns manufacture and honeycombing process at 65°C. The efficacy of 3D MNF scaffold for bone formation were evaluated using human embryonic stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hESC-MSCs) differentiation model and rabbit tibia bone defect model. In vitro, more cell proliferation and cell ingrowth were observed in 3D MNF scaffold. Moreover, calcium deposit was obviously detected in vitro differentiation of hESC-MSCs. In vivo, histology and X-ray showed that 3D MNF scaffold treated bone defect had fine 3D bony tissue formation around the scaffold as well as inside the scaffold at 3 weeks and 6 weeks. This study demonstrated that 3D MNF scaffold provides a structural support for hESC-MSCs growth and guides bone formation suggesting that this novel strategy successfully makes use of electrospun fibers for bone tissue engineering, which may help realize the clinical translation of electrospun nanofibers for regenerative medicine in future.', 22361056: 'The sorption and biodegradation of pyrene by Klebsiella oxytoca PYR-1 (PYR-1) in the presence of nonionic surfactant Tween 80 were investigated toward a better understanding that how surfactants can affect biodegradation of hydrophobic organic compounds. The results indicated that Tween 80 can promote the removal, sorption and biodegradation of pyrene depending on the surfactant concentration, of which the most significant promotion of biodegradation was achieved at critical micelle concentration of Tween 80 with an improvement of 22.4%. A highly positive correlation (P<0.0001) was observed between the biodegradation and sorption of pyrene with the presence of Tween 80. Biosorption experiments showed the same trends as biodegradation and further illustrated the improved biodegradation of pyrene was mainly due to surfactant-facilitated sorption. The regularly changes of cell surface hydrophobicity suggested formation of more hydrophobic surface caused by surfactant sorption lead to stimulation of pyrene sorption.', 22362147: 'A case study of the bioremediation of groundwater contaminated with trichloroethene (TCE) was conducted using the biostimulation agent, BD-1. TCE levels were monitored by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Total organic carbon (TOC) and volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were analyzed to investigate the environmental fate of BD-1. The effects of BD-1 on microbial activity were investigated using 16S rRNA gene-based quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. The biodegradation of BD-1 was accompanied by a reduction in TCE, and the initially high TOC levels decreased rapidly as BD-1 was transformed into VFAs. qPCR analysis showed that the genus Dehalobacter became progressively dominant through the experiment. These results suggested that BD-1 might dechlorinate TCE by activating dechlorinating bacteria.', 22363586: 'One of the most serious diseases in potato cultivars is caused by the pathogen Phytophthora infestans, which affects leaves, stems and tubers. Metalaxyl is a fungicide that protects potato plants from Phytophthora infestans. In Mexico, farmers apply metalaxyl 35 times during the cycle of potato production and the last application is typically 15 days before harvest. There are no records related to the presence of metalaxyl in potato tubers in Mexico. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of Acinetobacter sp on metalaxyl degradation in potato seedlings. The effect of bacteria and metalaxyl on the growth of potato seedlings was also evaluated. A metabolite profile analysis was conducted to determine potential molecular biomarkers produced by potato seedlings in the presence of Acinetobacter sp and metalaxyl. Metalaxyl did not affect the growth of potato seedlings. However, Acinetobacter sp strongly affected the growth of inoculated seedlings, as confirmed by plant length and plant fresh weights which were lower in inoculated potato seedlings (40% and 27%, respectively) compared to the controls. Acinetobacter sp also affected root formation. Inoculated potato seedlings showed a decrease in root formation compared to the controls. LC-MS/MS analysis of metalaxyl residues in potato seedlings suggests that Acinetobacter sp did not degrade metalaxyl. GC-TOF-MS platform was used in metabolic profiling studies. Statistical data analysis and metabolic pathway analysis allowed suggesting the alteration of metabolic pathways by both Acinetobacter sp infection and metalaxyl treatment. Several hundred metabolites were detected, 137 metabolites were identified and 15 metabolic markers were suggested based on statistical change significance found with PLS-DA analysis. These results are important for better understanding the interactions of putative endophytic bacteria and pesticides on plants and their possible effects on plant metabolism.', 22367464: 'A highly Al-resistant dissimilatory sulphate-reducing bacteria community was isolated from sludge of the wetland of Urgeiriça mine (community W). This community showed excellent sulphate removal at the presence of Al³⁺. After 27 days of incubation, 73, 86 and 81% of sulphate was removed in the presence of 0.48, 0.90 and 1.30 mM of Al³⁺, respectively. Moreover, Al³⁺ was simultaneously removed: 55, 85 and 78% of metal was removed in the presence of 0.48, 0.90 and 1.30 mM of Al³⁺, respectively. The dissociation of aluminium-lactate soluble complexes due to lactate consumption by dissimilatory sulphate-reducing bacteria can be responsible for aluminum removal, which probably precipitates as insoluble aluminium hydroxide. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene showed that this community was mainly composed by bacteria closely related to Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. However, bacteria affiliated to Proteus and Ralstonia were also present in the community.', 22367496: StringElement('Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has been widely used as sizing agents in textile and manufacturing industry, and it is a refractory compound with low biodegradability.', attributes={'Label': 'BACKGROUND', 'NlmCategory': 'BACKGROUND'}), 22386885: \"The effect of nitrophenolic shock loads on the performance of three lab scale SBRs was studied using a synthetic feed. Nitrophenols were biotransformed by Simultaneous heterotrophic Nitrification and aerobic Denitrification (SND) using a specially designed single sludge biomass containing Thiosphaera pantotropha. Reactors R1, R2 and R3 were fed with 200mg/L concentration of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), and 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (2,4,6-TNP) whereas reactor R was used as a background control. Three nitrophenolic shock loadings of 400, 600 and 800 mg/Ld were administrated by increasing the influent nitrophenolic concentration while keeping the hydraulic retention time as 48 h. The shocks were given continuously for a period of 4 days before switching back to normal nitrophenolic loading (200mg/Ld). The reactors were allowed to recover to normal performance level before administrating the next nitrophenolic shock load. The study showed that a nitrophenolic shock load, as high as 600 mg/Ld was completely degraded by the 4-NP & 2,4-DNP bioreactors while almost half degraded by the 2,4,6-TNP bioreactor without affecting the reactor's performance irreversibly. After resuming the normal nitrophenolic loading, it took almost 8-10 days for the reactors to recover from the shock effect. The study was further extended to evaluate the maximum possible mixed nitrophenolic loading (4-NP:2,4-DNP:2,4,6-TNP 1:1:1) to which a reactor (R3) containing 2,4,6-TNP acclimated single sludge biomass can be exposed without hampering the reactor performance irreversibly. The reactor was able to achieve pseudo-steady-state at a mixed nitrophenolic loading of 300 mg/Ld with more than 90% removal of all the three nitrophenols, but could remove half of the mixed nitrophenolic loading of 600 mg/Ld.\", 22400914: 'Trichoderma harzianum is a very important fungus for the reduction of the amount of heavy metals resulting from agricultural and industrial activities. This filamentous fungus has been shown to be tolerant towards several heavy metals (e.g. Cd, Pb, Zn, Ni and Mn), but the mechanism underlying this tolerance is not entirely understood. In this study, we confirmed the ability of T. harzianum to grow in the presence of cadmium and observed a significant stimulation of its growth in the presence of mercury. A molecular approach to investigate the cadmium tolerance mechanisms was carried out by the application of the suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) technique. To this end, we have used a particular strategy to discriminate cadmium-induced differentially expressed genes from those generally expressed upon heavy metal treatment. Several genes (109) were found to be overexpressed in the presence of cadmium, confirming the dramatic metabolic modification underlying the metal stress response of the fungus.', 22402341: 'A sediment microbial fuel cell (MFC) was tested to determine if electron transfer from the anaerobic zone of contaminated sediments to the overlying aerobic water could facilitate an enhanced and aerobic equivalent degradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). Results indicate that voltages as high as 190 mV (2162 mW/m(3)) were achieved in a sediment MFC with an anode buried in sediments containing TPH concentrations at approximately 16,000 mg kg(-1). Additionally, after approximately 66 days, the TPH degradation rates were 2% and 24% in the open-circuit control sediment MFC and active sediment MFC, respectively. Therefore, it appears that applying MFC technology to contaminated sediments enhances natural biodegradation by nearly 12 fold. Additionally, a novel sediment MFC was designed to provide a cost-effective method of passive oxidation or indirect aerobic degradation of contaminants in an otherwise anaerobic environment. In addition, the use of a wicking air cathode in this study maintained dissolved oxygen concentrations 1-2 mg l(-1) higher than submerged cathodes, demonstrating that this technology can be applied to environments with either aerobic or anaerobic overlying water and an anaerobic matrix, such as shallow lagoon, ponds, and marshes, and groundwater.', 22407823: 'Critical-sized bone defect regeneration is a remaining clinical concern. Numerous scaffold-based strategies are currently being investigated to enable in vivo bone defect healing. However, a deeper understanding of how a scaffold influences the tissue formation process and how this compares to endogenous bone formation or to regular fracture healing is missing. It is hypothesized that the porous scaffold architecture can serve as a guiding substrate to enable the formation of a structured fibrous network as a prerequirement for later bone formation. An ovine, tibial, 30-mm critical-sized defect is used as a model system to better understand the effect of the scaffold architecture on cell organization, fibrous tissue, and mineralized tissue formation mechanisms in vivo. Tissue regeneration patterns within two geometrically distinct macroscopic regions of a specific scaffold design, the scaffold wall and the endosteal cavity, are compared with tissue formation in an empty defect (negative control) and with cortical bone (positive control). Histology, backscattered electron imaging, scanning small-angle X-ray scattering, and nanoindentation are used to assess the morphology of fibrous and mineralized tissue, to measure the average mineral particle thickness and the degree of alignment, and to map the local elastic indentation modulus. The scaffold proves to function as a guiding substrate to the tissue formation process. It enables the arrangement of a structured fibrous tissue across the entire defect, which acts as a secondary supporting network for cells. Mineralization can then initiate along the fibrous network, resulting in bone ingrowth into a critical-sized defect, although not in complete bridging of the defect. The fibrous network morphology, which in turn is guided by the scaffold architecture, influences the microstructure of the newly formed bone. These results allow a deeper understanding of the mode of mineral tissue formation and the way this is influenced by the scaffold architecture. © 2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.', 22409265: 'Trichlorophenol (TCP) and its derivatives are introduced into the environment through numerous sources, including wood preservatives and biocides. Environmental contamination by TCPs is associated with human health risks, necessitating the development of cost-effective remediation techniques. Efficient phytoremediation of TCP is potentially feasible because it contains a hydroxyl group and is suitable for direct phase II metabolism. In this study, we present a system for TCP phytoremediation based on sugar conjugation by overexpressing a Populus putative UDP-glc-dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT). The enzyme PtUGT72B1 displayed the highest TCP-conjugating activity among all reported UGTs. Transgenic Arabidopsis demonstrated significantly enhanced tolerances to 2,4,5-TCP and 2,4,6-TCP. Transgenic plants also exhibited a strikingly higher capacity to remove TCP from their media. This work indicates that Populus UGT overexpression in Arabidopsis may be an efficient method for phytoremoval and degradation of TCP. Our findings have the potential to provide a suitable remediation strategy for sites contaminated by TCP.', 22411637: 'The use of biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) for controlled drug delivery has shown significant therapeutic potential. Polyaspartic acid and polylactic acid are the most intensively studied biodegradable polymers. In the present study, novel amphiphilic biodegradable co-polymer NPs, poly(L-aspartic acid-co-lactic acid) with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) (poly(AA-co-LA)/DPPE) is synthesized and subsequently used to encapsulate an antitumor drug doxorubicin (DOX). The formulation parameters of the NPs are optimized to improve encapsulation efficiency. The resulting drug-loaded NPs possess better size homogeneity (polydispersity) and exhibit pH-responsive drug release profiles. Cellular viability assays indicate that the poly(AA-co-LA)/DPPE NPs did not induce cell death, whereas doxorubicin encapsulated NPs were cytotoxic to various types of tumor cells. In addition, the free NPs could not enter the cell nuclei after internalized in tumor cells. The DOX-loaded NPs exhibit efficient intracellular delivery in tumor cells with co-localization in lysosome and delay entering into the nucleus, which suggests a time- and pH-dependent drug release profile within cells. When applied to deliver chemotherapeutics to a mouse xenograft model of human lung adenocarcinoma, DOX-loaded NPs have a comparable antitumor activity with free DOX, and greatly reduce systemic toxicity and mortality. The delivery of cytotoxic drugs directly to the nucleus specifically within tumor cells is of great interest. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the application of the amphiphilic polyaspartic acid derivative, poly(AA-co-LA)/DPPE, as a nanocarrier for cell nuclear delivery of potent antitumor drugs.', 22425515: 'The subject of this paper is the cultivation of the cyanobacterium Arthrospira (Sprirulina) platensis in olive-oil mill wastewater (OMWW) treated with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). The main positive effect of NaOCl on the OMWW characteristics is the decrease of the phenol concentration and turbidity, rendering the OMWW suitable for A. platensis growth. Maximum biomass production (1696 mg/l) was obtained when the concentration of OMWW in the cultivation medium was 10% with the supplementation of 1g/l NaNO(3) and 5 g/l NaHCO(3). However, the addition of NaHCO(3) has no significant effect, indicating that the only limited nutrient in this wastewater is nitrogen, while carbon is provided by the organic compounds of the wastewater. The maximum of the removals of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and carbohydrates was 73.18% and 91.19%, respectively, while phenols, phosphorus and nitrates in some runs was completely removed.', 22425516: 'Petroleum and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) degrading Streptomyces sp. isolate ERI-CPDA-1 was recovered from oil contaminated soil in Chennai, India. The degradation efficiencies were examined by GC-FID and the results showed that the isolate could remove 98.25% diesel oil, 99.14% naphthalene and 17.5% phenanthrene in 7 days at 30°C (0.1%). ERI-CPDA-1 was able to degrade naphthalene, phenanthrene and diesel oil and grow on petrol, diesel, kerosene, benzene, pyridine, methanol, ethanol, cyclohexane, tween-80, xylene, DMSO and toluene using them as sole carbon source. Effects of environmental condition on degradation of hydrocarbons (diesel oil, naphthalene and phenanthrene) were also studied at different pH, NaCl, temperature, concentration and incubation time. Degradation pathway for naphthalene has been proposed. Degradation metabolites were identified using GC-MS analysis of ethyl acetate extract of the cell free culture. The degradation products detected were benzaldehyde, catechol, phenylacetic acid and protocatechuic acid.', 22436798: 'The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vivo biodegradation and biocompatibility of three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds based on a hydroxyl-functionalized polyester (poly(hydroxymethylglycolide-co-ε-caprolactone), PHMGCL), which has enhanced hydrophilicity, increased degradation rate, and improved cell-material interactions as compared to its counterpart poly(ε-caprolactone), PCL. In this study, 3D scaffolds based on this polymer (PHMGCL, HMG:CL 8:92) were prepared by means of fiber deposition (melt-plotting). The biodegradation and tissue biocompatibility of PHMGCL and PCL scaffolds after subcutaneous implantation in Balb/c mice were investigated. At 4 and 12 weeks post implantation, the scaffolds were retrieved and evaluated for extent of degradation by measuring the residual weight of the scaffolds, thermal properties (DSC), and morphology (SEM) whereas the polymer was analyzed for both its composition ((1)H NMR) and molecular weight (GPC). The scaffolds with infiltrated tissues were harvested, fixed, stained and histologically analyzed. The in vitro enzymatic degradation of these scaffolds was also investigated in lipase solutions. It was shown that PHMGCL 3D-scaffolds lost more than 60% of their weight within 3 months of implantation while PCL scaffolds showed no weight loss in this time frame. The molecular weight (M(w)) of PHMGCL decreased from 46.9 kDa before implantation to 23.2 kDa after 3 months of implantation, while the molecular weight of PCL was unchanged in this period. (1)H NMR analysis showed that the degradation of PHMGCL was characterized by a loss of HMG units. In vitro enzymatic degradation showed that PHMGCL scaffolds were degraded within 50 h, while the degradation time for PCL scaffolds of similar structure was 72 h. A normal foreign body response to both scaffold types characterized by the presence of macrophages, lymphocytes, and fibrosis was observed with a more rapid onset in PHMGCL scaffolds. The extent of tissue-scaffold interactions as well as vascularization was shown to be higher for PHMGCL scaffolds compared to PCL ones. Therefore, the fast degradable PHMGCL which showed good biocompatibility is a promising biomaterial for tissue engineering applications.', 22440578: 'Bio-sequestration of CO(2) through microalgae cultivation is considered as a viable option for biofuel production as well as CO(2) mitigation. Influence of CO(2) sparging period and interval was evaluated on the growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae cultivated in domestic wastewater under mixotrophic microenvironment. Process performance was assessed in two phases viz., growth (GP) and starvation phases (SP) each with 8 days of retention time. Experimental variations depicted marked influence on biomass growth and lipid accumulation of microalgae with the function of harvesting period. Sparging period of 120 s documented maximum biomass growth (GP, 3.4 mg/ml) and lipid productivity (SP, 27.3%) while in intervals, 4h (120 s) condition showed maximum biomass (3.2mg/ml) and lipid productivity (27.8%). Total chlorophyll components documented higher concentrations of Chl b supporting the observed higher lipid productivity. Fatty acid composition varied with the experimental variations and represented higher degree of saturation indicating their utility as biodiesel.', 22455319: \"In a previous study, selenocyanate was tentatively identified as a biotransformation product when green algae were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of selenate. In this follow-up study, we confirm conclusively the presence of selenocyanate in Chlorella vulgaris culture medium by electrospray mass spectrometry, based on selenium's known isotopic pattern. We also demonstrate that the observed phenomenon extends to other green algae (Chlorella kesslerii and Scenedesmus obliquus) and at least one species of blue-green algae (Synechococcus leopoliensis). Further laboratory experiments show that selenocyanate production by algae is enhanced by addition of nitrate, which appears to serve as a source of cyanide produced in the algae. Ultimately, this biotransformation process was confirmed in field experiments where trace amounts of selenocyanate (0.215 ± 0.010 ppb) were observed in a eutrophic, selenium-impacted river with massive algal blooms, which consisted of filamentous green algae (Cladophora genus) and blue-green algae (Anabaena genus). Selenocyanate abundance was low despite elevated selenium concentrations, apparently due to suppression of selenate uptake by sulfate, and insufficient nitrogen concentrations. Finally, trace levels of several other unidentified selenium-containing compounds were observed in these river water samples; preliminary suggestions for their identities include thioselenate and small organic Se species.\", 22484720: 'In biological nitrogen removal, application of the autotrophic anammox process is gaining ground worldwide. Although this field has been widely researched in last years, some aspects as the accelerating effect of putative intermediates (mainly N₂H₄ and NH₂OH) need more specific investigation. In the current study, experiments in a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and batch tests were performed to evaluate the optimum concentrations of anammox process intermediates that accelerate the autotrophic nitrogen removal and mitigate a decrease in the anammox bacteria activity using anammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation) biomass enriched on ring-shaped biofilm carriers. Anammox biomass was previously grown on blank biofilm carriers for 450 days at moderate temperature 26.0 (±0.5) °C by using sludge reject water as seeding material. FISH analysis revealed that anammox microorganisms were located in clusters in the biofilm. With addition of 1.27 and 1.31 mg N L⁻¹ of each NH₂OH and N₂H₄, respectively, into the MBBR total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency was rapidly restored after inhibitions by NO₂⁻. Various combinations of N₂H₄, NH₂OH, NH₄⁺, and NO₂⁻ were used as batch substrates. The highest total nitrogen (TN) removal rate with the optimum N₂H₄ concentration (4.38 mg N L⁻¹) present in these batches was 5.43 mg N g⁻¹ TSS h⁻¹, whereas equimolar concentrations of N₂H₄ and NH₂OH added together showed lower TN removal rates. Intermediates could be applied in practice to contribute to the recovery of inhibition-damaged wastewater treatment facilities using anammox technology.', 22489923: 'Mercury uptake was induced in two cultivars of  Brassica juncea  under field conditions using thiosulfate. Analysis was conducted to better understand the mechanism of uptake, speciation of mercury in plants, and redistribution of mercury in the soil. Plant mercury and sulfur concentrations were increased after thiosulfate treatment, and a linear correlation between mercury and sulfur was observed. Mercury may be absorbed and transported in plants as the Hg-thiosulfate complex. The majority of mercury in treated plant tissues (two cultivars) was bound to sulfur in a form similar to β-HgS (66-94%). Remaining mercury was present in forms similar to Hg-cysteine (1-10%) and Hg-dicysteine (8-28%). The formation of β-HgS may relate to the transport and assimilation of sulfate in plant tissues. Mercury-thiosulfate complex could decompose to mercuric and sulfate ions in the presence of free protons inside the plasma membrane, while sulfide ions would be produced by the assimilation of sulfate. The concomitant presence of mercuric ions and S(2-) would precipitate β-HgS. The mercury concentration in the rhizosphere decreased in the treated relative to the nontreated soil. The iron/manganese oxide and organic-bound fractions of soil mercury were transformed to more bioavailable forms (soluble and exchangeable and specifically sorbed) and taken up by plants.', 22522011: 'High molecular weight biodegradable polyesters were prepared from sebacic acid, ethylene glycol and butylene glycol through a simple non-solvent polycondensation with a low toxicity catalyst. The successful synthesis of the polyesters was confirmed by gel permeation chromatography, (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance and Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopies and differential scanning calorimetry. The degradation tests were performed at 37 °C in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) and showed a mass loss of ~5% over 12 weeks compared with only 2% for polycaprolactone (PCL). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results following culture of osteoblasts on the polymer surface showed that poly(ethylene sebacate) and poly(butylene sebacate) films were optimal for osteoblast formation in terms of Runx 2 and osteocalcin gene expression.', 22522015: 'A pilot-scale lysis-cryptic growth system was built and operated continuously for excess sludge reduction. Combined ultrasonic/alkaline disintegration and hydrolysis/acidogenesis were integrated into its sludge pretreatment system. Continuous operation showed that the observed biomass yield and the sludge reduction efficiency of the lysis-cryptic growth system were 0.27 kg VSS/kg COD consumed and 56.5%, respectively. The water quality of its effluent was satisfactory. The sludge pretreatment system performed well and its TCOD removal efficiency was 7.9% which contributed a sludge reduction efficiency of 2.1%. The SCOD, VFA, TN, NH(4)(+)-N, TP and pH in the supernatant of pretreated sludge were 1790 mg/L, 1530 mg COD/L, 261.1mg/L, 114.0mg/L, 93.1mg/L and 8.69, respectively. The total operation cost of the lysis-cryptic growth system was $ 0.186/m(3) wastewater, which was 11.4% less than that of conventional activated sludge (CAS) system without excess sludge pretreatment.', 22522021: 'Three geometrically different biofilms were investigated for the start-up of deammonification reactor. The planar biofilm with 4 g/L biomass could achieve 0.47 kg N/(m(3)day) nitrogen removal, compared to only 3 and 2g/L biomass needed for cylindrical and granular biofilms, respectively. Planar biofilm was significantly affected by Dissolved Oxygen (DO) changes, whereas granular biofilm could effectively work in a wide range of DO. The maximum performance of 0.49, 0.83 and 1.27 kg N/(m(3)day) were obtained in planar, cylindrical and granular biofilms, respectively, reflecting that granular biofilm was the most capable due to its large surface area for mass transfer. Cylindrical biofilm was also effective as denitrifiers growth was intimately related to a large anaerobic zone. In addition, DO should be increased abruptly for each biofilm as the shortened HRT. This investigation indicates profound influence of biofilm geometry on deammonification process, which might serve as input for further experimental progress.', 22531167: 'Reduction of carbon loss from the effluent is one of the most important aspects of photobioreactors design. In this study, a novel gas sparger of bubble tank was adopted in a photobioreactor to enhance carbon dioxide (CO(2)) mass transfer rate as well as alleviate dissolved oxygen (DO) accumulation. The results showed that low DO level in the culture can be obtained due to the turbulent hydrodynamic condition provided by the bubble tank. The effects of CO(2) concentration, flow rate of influent, and light intensity on CO(2) removal efficiency were investigated. The maximum CO(2) removal efficiency was 94% at flow rate of 30 mL min(-1), light intensity of 179 μmol m(-2) s(-1) and CO(2) concentration of 10%, implying that the novel gas sparger is a promising alternative for CO(2) removal from CO(2)-enriched air by cultivating microalgae in the photobioreactor.', 22537403: 'This study monitored the abundance of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and the bacterial diversity during composting of swine manure spiked with chlortetracycline, sulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin at two different levels and a control without antibiotics. Resistance genes of tetracycline (tetQ, tetW, tetC, tetG, tetZ and tetY), sulfonamide (sul1, sul2, dfrA1 and dfrA7) and fluoroquinolone (gyrA and parC) represented 0.02-1.91%, 0.67-10.28% and 0.00005-0.0002%, respectively, of the total 16S rDNA copies in the initial composting mass. After 28-42 days of composting, these ARGs, except parC, were undetectable in the composting mass indicating that composting is a potential method of manure management. Polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of bacterial 16S rDNA of the composting mass indicated that the addition of antibiotics up to 100, 20 and 20mg/kg of chlortetracycline, sulfadiazine and ciprofloxacin, respectively, elicited only a transient perturbation and the bacterial diversity was restored in due course of composting.', 22540865: 'Carbamazepine is one of the most persistent pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater effluents due to its resistance to biodegradation-based conventional treatment. Advanced oxidation can efficiently degrade carbamazepine, but the toxicity and persistence of the oxidation products may be more relevant than the parent. This study sets out to determine whether the products of advanced oxidation of carbamazepine can be biotransformed and ultimately mineralized by developing a novel methodology to assess these sequential treatment processes. The methodology traces the transformation products of the (14)C-labeled carbamazepine during UV/hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation and subsequent biotransformation by mixed, undefined cultures using liquid scintillation counting and liquid chromatography with radioactivity, mass spectrometry, and UV detectors. The results show that the oxidation byproducts of carbamazepine containing a hydroxyl or carbonyl group can be fully mineralized by a mixed bacterial inoculum. A tertiary treatment approach that includes oxidation and biotransformation has the potential to synergistically mineralize persistent pharmaceutical compounds in wastewater treatment plant effluents. The methodology developed for this study can be applied to assess the mineralization potential of other persistent organic contaminants.', 22541952: 'A two-stage composting experiment was performed to utilize pig manure for producing maggots as feed supplement and organic fertilizer. Seven-day composting of 1.8 ton fresh manure inoculated with 9 kg mixture of housefly neonates and wheat bran produced 193 kg aging maggots, followed by 12 week composting to maturity. Reaching the thermophilic phase and final maturity faster was characteristic of the maggot-treated compost compared with the same-size natural compost. Upon the transit of the maggot-treated compost to the second stage, the composting temperature maintained around 55 °C for 9 days and the moisture decreased to ~40%. Moreover, higher pH, faster detoxification and different activity patterns for some microbial enzymes were observed. There was a strong material loss (35% water-soluble carbon and 16% total nitrogen) caused by the maggot culture in the first stage. Our results highlight a higher economic value of pig manure achieved through the two-stage composting without bulking agents.', 22542130: 'While reverse osmosis (RO) technology is playing an increasingly important role in the reclamation of municipal wastewater, safe disposal of the resulting RO concentrate (ROC), which can have high levels of effluent organic pollutants, remains a challenge to the water industry. The potential of UVC/H(2)O(2) treatment for degrading the organic pollutants and increasing their biodegradability has been demonstrated in several studies, and in this work the impact of the water quality variables pH, salinity and initial organic concentration on the UVC/H(2)O(2) (3 mM) treatment of a municipal ROC was investigated. The reduction in chemical oxygen demand and dissolved organic carbon was markedly faster and greater under acidic conditions, and the treatment performance was apparently not affected by salinity as increasing the ROC salinity 4-fold had only minimal impact on organics reduction. The biodegradability of the ROC (as indicated by biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) level) was at least doubled after 2 h UVC/H(2)O(2) treatment under various reaction conditions. However, the production of biodegradable intermediates was limited after 30 min treatment, which was associated with the depletion of the conjugated compounds. Overall, more than 80% of the DOC was removed after 2 h UVC/3 mM H(2)O(2) treatment followed by biological treatment (BDOC test) for the ROC at pH 4-8.5 and electrical conductivity up to 11.16 mS/cm. However, shorter UV irradiation time gave markedly higher energy efficiency (e.g., EE/O 50 kWh/m(3) at 30 min (63% DOC removal) cf. 112 kWh/m(3) at 2 h). No toxicity was detected for the treated ROC using Microtox(®) tests. Although the trihalomethane formation potential increased after the UVC/H(2)O(2) treatment, it was reduced to below that of the raw ROC after the biological treatment.', 22543958: '1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA), a major organic and groundwater contaminant, has very strong toxic effects on humans, plants and microorganisms. Effects of TCA on enzymatic activity and microbial diversity were investigated in the anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) under methanogenic, nitrate-reducing, sulfate-reducing and benzene/toluene degrading conditions. The activities of three enzymes (lactate dehydrogenase, phosphatase and protease) were significantly decreased in the presence of 5\\xa0mg/L TCA. Within these three affected enzymes, phosphatase activity may serve as a noteworthy marker of bacterial toxicity. The activity of phosphatase was 0.2\\xa0U/L in methanogenic conditions with 5\\xa0mg/L TCA, which was 99% lower than the controls, and the enzyme activity was 18.6\\xa0U/L in methanogenic conditions with 1\\xa0mg/L TCA, which was 7% lower than the controls. DGGE profiles showed that TCA altered the bacterial community distribution and diversity obviously during the 21\\xa0day of TCA exposure. The enzyme activities decreased second lowest but TCA degrading strains Clostridium sp. DhR-2/LM-G01, Bacterial clone DCE25 and Bacterial clone DPHB06 were enriched in the methanogenic ASBR amended TCA.', 22544353: 'A lead resistant bacterial strain isolated from effluent of lead battery manufacturing company of Goa, India has been identified as Enterobacter cloacae strain P2B based on morphological, biochemical characters, FAME profile and 16S rDNA sequence data. This bacterial strain could resist lead nitrate up to 1.6\\xa0mM. Significant increase in exopolysaccharide (EPS) production was observed as the production increased from 28 to 108\\xa0mg/L dry weight when exposed to 1.6\\xa0mM lead nitrate in Tris buffered minimal medium. Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy of this EPS revealed presence of several functional groups involved in metal binding viz. carboxyl, hydroxyl and amide groups along with glucuronic acid. Gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry analysis of alditol-acetate derivatives of acid hydrolysed EPS produced in presence of 1.6\\xa0mM lead nitrate demonstrated presence of several neutral sugars such as rhamnose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose and glucose, which contribute to lead binding hydroxyl groups. Scanning electron microscope coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometric analysis of this lead resistant strain exposed to 1.6\\xa0mM lead nitrate interestingly revealed mucous EPS surrounding bacterial cells which sequestered 17\\xa0% lead (as weight %) extracellularly and protected the bacterial cells from toxic effects of lead. This lead resistant strain also showed multidrug resistance. Thus these results significantly contribute to better understanding of structure, function and environmental application of lead-enhanced EPSs produced by bacteria. This lead-enhanced biopolymer can play a very important role in bioremediation of several heavy metals including lead.', 22569140: \"Bioremediation processes based on biofilms are usually very effective. The presence of (bio)surfactants in such processes can increase bioavailability of hydrophobic pollutants in aqueous phase. However, surfactants can affect the biofilm as well as individual microbial cells in different ways. Biosurfactants produced by a microbial population can be involved in the final structure of biofilm. An external application of synthetic surfactants or 'foreign' biosurfactants often results in partial or complete destruction of the biofilm and their high concentrations also have a toxic effect on microbial cells. Finding a suitable surfactant and its concentration, which would minimize the negative effects mentioned above, would allow to construct effective bioremediation processes using the benefits of both the biofilm and the surfactant. In this context, G(+) bacterium Rhodococcus erythropolis, which has a wide potential for biodegradation of aromatic compounds, was studied. High surface hydrophobicity of its cells, given mainly by the presence of mycolic acids in the cell envelopes, allows formation of stable biofilms. Three synthetic surfactants (Spolapon AOS 146, Novanik 0633A, Tween 80) and rhamnolipid isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used. Changes in initial adhesion and biofilm formation caused by the surfactants were monitored in a flow cell equipped with hydrophilic/hydrophobic carriers and analyzed by image analysis.\", 22571537: 'The effects of nonionic surfactants on degradation of engine oil in metal contaminated soil using Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) were investigated. Triton X-100 and Tween 80 were individually applied to test pots in which the soil had been earlier spiked with 500 mg kg(-1) of used engine oil, 500 mg kg(-1) of PbCl(2) and 50 mg kg(-1) of CdCl(2). For he application of Tween 80 to the soil, the fractions of rhizodegraded oil and the fractions of removed metals from the soil were well correlated. On the other hand, such a correlation did not exist between the fractions of rhizodegraded oil and the fractions of removed metals for the application of Triton X-100 to the soil. It was observed that Triton X-100 caused a significant decrease in basal soil respiration (BSR) which can be attributed to a reduction in microbial activity. This, in turn, resulted in a reduction of the rhizodegraded oil fraction. Tween 80 proved to be effective in the rhizodegradation of oil under aerobic conditions. Further, this surfactant seems to have the positive effect on the soil microbial population when viewed in terms of BSR.', 22572166: 'Hyperaccumulators are grown in contaminated soil and water in order that contaminants are taken up and accumulated. Transport of metals from soil to plant is initially dependent on the solubility and mobility of metals in soil solution which is controlled by soil and metal properties and plant physiology. Complexation with organic and inorganic ligands may increase mobility and availability of metals for plants. In this work the influence of desferrioxamine-B (DFO-B), which naturally is produced in the rhizosphere, and zeolite on Cd accumulation in root and shoot of Thlaspi caerulescens (Cd hyperaccumulator) was investigated. Plants were grown in pots with clean quartz sand, amended with 1% zeolite; treatment solutions included 0, 10, and 100 μM Cd and 70 μM DFO-B. Addition of zeolite to the quartz sand significantly reduced Cd concentration in plant tissues and translocation from root to shoot. On contrary, DFO-B considerably enhanced Cd sorption by roots and translocation to aerial part of plants. Treating the plants with zeolite and DFO-B together at 10 μM Cd resulted in reduction of the bioaccumulation factor but enhancement of Cd translocation from root to shoot at the rate of 13%. In contrast, at 100 μM Cd in the solution both bioaccumulation and translocation factors decreased. Total metal accumulation as a key factor for evaluating the efficiency of phytoremediation was highly influenced by treatments. Presence of zeolite in pots significantly decreased total Cd accumulation by plants, whereas, DFO-B clearly enhanced it.', 22572551: 'A new approach was developed to achieve autotrophic nitrogen removal from ammonium at low applied voltage in a single-compartment 3-dimensional microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). The MEC consisted of anodic and cathodic electrodes, on which nitrifying and denitrifying biofilms, respectively, were attached. Nitrogen removal can be enhanced at an applied voltage in the MEC. Besides, the nitrogen removal efficiency gradually increased from 70.3% to 92.6% with the increase of applied voltage from 0.2 to 0.4V, as well as the maximum current was varied from 4.4 to 14 mA. The corresponding coulombic efficiency also increased from 82% to 94.4%, indicating that the increasing applied voltage could enhance electron extraction from ammonium during its oxidative removal. The DO was found to be a critical factor which affected the nitrogen removal in this MEC system. These results demonstrated that the MEC process was applicable to achieve autotrophic nitrogen removal from wastewater containing ammonium.', 22581612: 'Silk fibroin (SF) from silkworms has been widely studied as a biomaterial. The degradation behavior of silk biomaterials is important for medical applications, but few studies have examined long-term degradation behavior in vivo. In this study, we investigated the degradation behavior of SF membranes in vitro and in vivo. For the in vitro assay, we observed degradation of silk membranes in phosphate buffered saline, culture media, and an enzyme (proteinase K) solution. In the proteinase K solution, 80% of the silk membranes degraded within 10 days. Silk membranes exhibited no cytotoxicity toward L929 cells and rat tissues. To investigate the degradation of silk membranes in vivo, they were implanted subcutaneously in rats and harvested 19 months after surgery. Scanning electron microscopy imaging and histological analysis of silk membrane explants showed that they broke into several pieces after 16 months. Results show that silk membranes are biocompatible and display excellent long-term degradation behavior when used as biomaterials.', 22587556: 'The increasing use of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) in consumer and industrial products highlights a need to understand their potential environmental impacts. In this study, the response of anaerobic granular sludge (AGS) to a shock load of ZnO NPs during anaerobic biological wastewater treatment was reported. It was observed that the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of AGS and the methane production were not significantly influenced at ZnO NPs of 10 and 50 mg per gram of total suspended solids (mg/g-TSS), but they were decreased when the dosage of ZnO NPs was greater than 100 mg/g-TSS. The visualization of EPS structure with multiple fluorescence labeling and confocal laser scanning microscope revealed that ZnO NPs mainly caused the decrease of proteins by 69.6%. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis further indicated that the C-O-C group of polysaccharides and carboxyl group of proteins in EPS were also changed in the presence of ZnO NPs. The decline of EPS induced by ZnO NPs resulted in their deteriorating protective role on the inner microorganisms of AGS, which was in correspondence with the observed lower general physiological activity of AGS and the death of microorganisms. Further investigation showed that the negative influence of ZnO NPs on methane production was due to their severe inhibition on the methanization step.', 22609657: 'The objective of this study was to study the simultaneous biodegradation of Ni-citrate complexes and removal of Ni from solutions by Pseudomonas alcaliphila. Adding excess citrate to 1:1 Ni-citrate complexes promoted the degradation of the complexes and removal of Ni. The alkaline pH generated by the metabolism of excess citrate caused partial dissociation of citrate from the Ni-citrate complexes, allowing degradation, and the released Ni was removed through bioaccumulation and precipitation. Addition of Fe(3+) enhanced the degradation of Ni-citrate complexes and removal of Ni from solutions. The displacement of Ni from recalcitrant Ni-citrate complexes by Fe(3+) and subsequent biodegradation of the degradable Fe(III)-citrate complex resulted in complete metabolism of citrate. The almost complete removal of Ni (>98%) can be attributed to the combination of coprecipitation with Fe(3+), bioaccumulation and precipitation. P. alcaliphila potentially could be applied in the treatment of effluent containing Ni-citrate complexes.', 22609661: 'This study presents a novel strategy based on free nitrous acid (FNA) treatment to improve the biodegradability of secondary sludge. Several experiments were conducted to demonstrate the biocidal effect of FNA on activated sludge. The viable fraction as well as the biological activity of the biomass decreased significantly after 8-48 h treatment with FNA. The biodegradability of the FNA treated sludge was compared to that of the same sludge without FNA treatment by aerobically digesting these sludges with a full-scale activated sludge for 14 and 6 days respectively. Ninety percent of the FNA treated biomass was consumed during the 14-day aerobic digestion compared to 41% achieved with the untreated biomass. During the 6-day aerobic digestion, 50% of the FNA-treated sludge was degraded. The results indicate that FNA treatment substantially increases sludge biodegradability.', 22609676: 'Zinc and cadmium can be efficiently removed from solutions using the brown algae, Macrocystis pyrifera. Treatment with CaCl(2) allowed stabilization of the biosorbent. The maximum biosorption capacities in mono-component systems were 0.91 mmol g(-1) and 0.89 mmol g(-1) and the Langmuir affinity coefficients were 1.76 L mmol(-1) and 1.25 L mmol(-1) for Zn(II) and Cd(II), respectively. In two-component systems, Zn(II) and Cd(II) adsorption capacities were reduced by 50% and 40%, respectively and the biosorbent showed a preference for Cd(II) over Zn(II). HNO(3) (0.1M) and EDTA (0.1M) achieved 90-100% desorption of both ions from the loaded biomass. While HNO(3) preserved the biomass structure, EDTA destroyed it completely. Fourier transform infrared spectra identified the contribution of carboxylic, amine and sulfonate groups on Zn(II) and Cd(II) biosorption. These results showed that biosorption using M. pyrifera-treated biomass could be an affordable and simple process for cadmium and zinc removal from wastewaters.', 22613890: 'Dietzia natronolimnaea JQ-AN was isolated from industrial wastewater containing aniline. Under aerobic conditions, the JQ-AN strain degraded 87% of the aniline in a 300 mg L(-1) aniline solution after 120 h of shake flask incubation in a medium containing sodium acetate. This strain had an unusually high salinity tolerance in minimal medium (0-6% NaCl, w/v). The optimal pH for microbial growth and aniline biodegradation was pH 8.0. Two liters of simulated aniline wastewater was created in a reactor at pH 8.0 and 3% NaCl (w/v), and biodegradation of aniline was tested over 7 days at 30 °C. For the initial concentrations of 100, 300, and 500 mg L(-1), 100%, 80.5% and 72% of the aniline was degraded, respectively. Strain JQ-AN may use an ortho-cleavage pathway for dissimilation of the catechol intermediate.', 22615921: 'Atrazine (ATZ) and S-metolachlor (S-MET) are two herbicides widely used, often as mixtures. The present work examined whether the presence of S-MET affects the ATZ-biodegradation activity of the bioaugmentation bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP in a crop soil. S-MET concentrations were selected for their relevance in worst-case scenarios of soil contamination by a commercial formulation containing both herbicides. At concentrations representative of application of high doses of the formulation (up to 50 µg g(-1) of soil, corresponding to a dose approximately 50× higher than the recommended field dose (RD)), the presence of pure S-MET significantly affected neither bacteria survival (~10(7) initial viable cells g(-1) of soil) nor its ATZ-mineralization activity. Consistently, biodegradation experiments, in larger soil microcosms spiked with 20× or 50 × RD of the double formulation and inoculated with the bacterium, revealed ATZ to be rapidly (in up to 5 days) and extensively (>96%) removed from the soil. During the 5 days, concentration of S-MET decreased moderately to about 60% of the initial, both in inoculated and non-inoculated microcosms. Concomitantly, an accumulation of the two metabolites S-MET ethanesulfonic acid and S-MET oxanilic acid was found. Despite the dissipation of almost all the ATZ from the treated soils, the respective eluates were still highly toxic to an aquatic microalgae species, being as toxic as those from the untreated soil. We suggest that this high toxicity may be due to the S-MET and/or its metabolites remaining in the soil.', 22617037: 'Influence of the frequently used carbon sources in nitrate removal processes were evaluated in a lab-scale biofilm reactor. The NO3-N removal efficiency was in the order acetate>glucose>methanol>ethanol. Acetate-fed biofilm reduced nearly 100% NO3-N with negligible amount of NO2-N accumulation. Although 99% NO3-N was reduced in the glucose-fed biofilm, substantial NH3-N and NO2-N accumulated. Methanol-fed biofilm reduced 72% of NO3-N with accumulation of 2.2 mg L(-1) of NO2-N, while biofilm formed in presence of ethanol showed 61% reduction in NO3-N although relatively higher ratio of denitrifiers were observed. Acetate and ethanol-fed biofilm displayed characteristic biofilm architecture with voids, but the former had relatively higher thickness and diffusion distance. In presence of glucose and methanol, a confluent biofilm without characteristic voids was formed. Pseudomonas sp. numerically dominated the acetate and ethanol-fed biofilm, while Enterobacter sp. and Methylobacillus sp., were abundant in glucose and methanol biofilms respectively.', 22621807: 'The effects of packing rates (20%, 30%, and 40%) of polyurethane foam (PUF) to the removal of organics and nitrogen were investigated by continuously feeding artificial sewage in three aerobic moving bed biofilm reactors. The results indicated that the packing rate of the PUF carriers had little influence on the COD removal efficiency (81% on average). However, ammonium removal was affected by the packing rates, which was presumably due to the different relative abundances of nitrifying bacteria. A high ammonium removal efficiency of 96.3% at a hydraulic retention time of 5h was achieved in 40% packing rate reactor, compared with 37.4% in 20% packing rate. Microprofiles of dissolved oxygen and nitrate revealed that dense biofilm limits the DO transfer distance and nitrate diffusion. Pyrosequencing analysis of the biofilm showed that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia were the three most abundant phyla, but the proportions of the microbial community varied with the packing rate of the PUF carriers.', 22621808: 'The enzyme PAD from Lactobacillus plantarum CECT 748T decarboxylates some cinnamic acids namely p-coumaric acid (p-CA), caffeic acid (CA), and ferulic acid (FA) into their corresponding 4-vinyl derivatives (4-VD): 4-vinyl phenol (4-VP), 4-vinyl catechol (4-VC), and 4-vinyl guaiacol (4-VG), respectively, which are valuable food additives mainly employed as flavouring agents. The gene encoding this enzyme was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant E. coli cells overproducing L. plantarum PAD showed a preference to degrade mainly p-CA and CA. Sterilized liquors obtained after alkaline hydrolysis of corn cob or alkaline hydrolysis of the solid residue coming from acid hydrolysis of corn cob were employed as growth media in fermentations performed in shaker or bioreactor. The fermentative process allowed converting 2222.8 mg/L p-CA into 993.9 mg/L 4-VP. The process described here allowed the production with a high-yield of a valuable food additive from a by-product of the food industry.', 22677051: 'A Gram-positive moderately halophilic Cr(VI) tolerant bacterial strain H4, isolated from saline mangrove soil, was identified as Vigribacillus sp. by biochemical characterization and 16S rRNA analysis. In LB medium, the strain could tolerate up to 1000 mg L(-1) Cr(VI) concentration and reduced 90.2 and 99.2% of 100 mg L(-1) Cr(VI) under optimized set of condition within 70 h in absence and presence of 6 wt.% NaCl, respectively. The fitting of time course reduction data to an exponential rate equation yielded the Cr(VI) reduction rate constants in the range (0.69-5.56)×10(-2)h(-1). Analyses of total chromium and bacterial cell associated with reduced product by AAS, SEM/EDS, TEM/SAED, FT-IR and UV-vis-DRS indicated the formation of about 35% of insoluble Cr(III) either as Cr(OH)(3) precipitate in nanometric size or immobilized on the bacterial cell surface while the remaining 65% of reduced chromium was present as soluble Cr(III) in the growth medium. Powder XRD analysis revealed the amorphous nature of the precipitated Cr(OH)(3). The high Cr(VI) reducing ability of the strain under saline condition suggests the Vigribacillus sp. as a new and efficient strain capable of remediating highly saline Cr(VI) polluted industrial effluents.', 22677086: 'Biomass with denitrifying phosphate uptake ability was tested under sequencing anaerobic-aerobic and anaerobic-anoxic conditions. The initial dose of acetate, under anaerobic conditions varied to achieve different PHA (poly-hydroxyalkanoates) saturation of PAO (polyphosphate accumulating organisms) cells. Increased acetate dosage under anaerobic conditions led to higher phosphate release and increased PHA storage by PAOs and, also, to greater phosphate uptake rates under the following aerobic and/or anoxic conditions. The experimental results also indicated that when organic carbon is limited under anaerobic conditions, more internal glycogen supplementary to polyphosphate cleavage is utilized by the biomass, resulting in less phosphate release and more PHA stored per acetate taken up. In the subsequent aerobic and/or anoxic phase PAOs demonstrate an improved EBPR (enhanced biological phosphorus removal) performance, with regard to PHA consumption per phosphate taken up, for reduced initial biomass PHA content under both aerobic and anoxic conditions. The examination of EBPR biomass under controlled operational conditions, where experimental analysis of the relevant compounds in the bulk phase (PO(4)(3-), NO(3)(-) and/or O(2)) in conjunction with the biomass intracellular products (PHA, glycogen), contributes to an improved understanding of the PAOs metabolic behavior, with regard to organic substrate availability.', 22695142: 'Partial nitrification under various concentrations of NaCl (0-40 g/l) at a constant operational condition was investigated in a submerged biofilter reactor. The highest NO(2)-N/NO(x)-N ratio (0.76) was achieved at the NLR of 830 g NH(4)-N/m(3) day with salt free wastewater. Small increase the salt content led to higher activities and the NH(4)-N removal efficiency increased from 92% to 95% at 1 g/l NaCl concentration. Over this concentration, each NaCl addition provoked the NH(4)-N oxidation and a sharp increase of inhibition was observed. The total oxidized NH(4)-N was achieved at the nitrogen loading rate (NLR) and surface loading rate (SLR) of 0.754 kg/m(3)day and 3.23 g/m(2) day, respectively without salt in the feed wastewater and it was decreased to 0.322 kg/m(3) day and 1.38 g/m(2) day at the salinity of 40 g/l in the PNBR.', 22704217: 'The widespread concern about pollution caused by Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) raises the question of how they affect soil microbial communities which are potentially involved in the transformation of these pollutants. Using microcosms, we describe the effect of anthracene, a model PAH, on microbial communities inhabiting a Pinus halepensis litter from both coastal (COS) and inland (INL) Mediterranean sites. The microcosms were incubated over 3 months (25°C, 60% WHC) and the effects of anthracene on microbial activities of both litters were monitored. Different enzyme activities (laccase, cellulase, β-glucosidase and acid phosphatase) and microbial respiration were measured and variations in litter chemical composition over incubation were determined using (13)C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) from both sites. Our results show that lignocellulolytic enzymes increased markedly after a 3-month incubation in COS microcosms, especially in the presence of anthracene, whereas INL microcosms were not similarly affected. These results show that anthracene not only has no toxic effect on the microbial activities tested but actually enhances the lignocellulolytic activities of the fungal communities from coastal litters, demonstrating the detoxification potential and resistance of stressed Mediterranean coastal ecosystems.', 22705956: 'Enantioenriched heteroaryl ethanols and aryl heteroarylmethanols are important intermediates and structural motifs in medicinal chemistry. Asymmetric biocatalytic reduction of corresponding ketones provides a straightforward approach for preparation of these compounds. Accordingly, three newly isolated fungal strains have been described, which produced the desired heteroaryl alcohols in high enantiomeric excess (ee). A broad substrate specificity was observed within these limited number of biocatalysts as demonstrated by preparation of a variety of heteroaryl alcohols, including (S)-5-(1-hydroxyethyl)furo[2,3-c]pyridine, a key intermediate for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitor, (S)-phenyl(pyridin-2-yl)methanol, an analgesic and (S,S)-2,6-bis(1-hydroxyethyl)pyridine, a chiral building block, mostly in >99% ee and 80-92% yield. Micro-morphologically, one of the isolate was found to be similar to Penicillium funiculosum. However, its β-tubulin sequence showed only 88% sequence identity with the known β-tubulin sequences of Penicillium. It may, therefore, represent a new species of Penicillium. The other biocatalysts were identified as Alternaria alternata and Talaromyces flavus.', 22744681: 'A simple anaerobic-activated sludge system, in which microorganisms are immobilized by a novel functional carrier, was used for removing nitrate in groundwater. The operating conditions, including hydraulic retention time (HRT), C/N ratio, temperature and NO(3)(-)-N loading concentration were investigated. The NO(3)(-)-N concentration, residual chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrite accumulation were used as indicators to assess the water quality of the effluent. The anaerobic biomass loading capacity in the carrier was 12.8 g/L and the denitrifying Pseudomonas sp. and Rhodocyclaceae bacterium were dominant among the immobilized microorganisms in the anaerobic-activated sludge. Under operating conditions of HRT= 1.5 h, C/N= 2-3 and T= 16.8-20 °C, the removal efficiency of NO(3)(-)-N exceeded 93%, corresponding to a relatively high denitrification rate of 0.73 kg NO(3)(-)-N m(-3) d(-1), when the NO(3)(-)-N loading concentration was 50 mg/L. The NO(3)(-)-N concentration of the effluent always met regulatory criteria for drinking water (<10 mg/L) in the main developed and developing countries. The effluent COD was also below 10 mg/L. Although some nitrite accumulated (0-1.77 mg/L) during the operating period, it can be decreased through adjusting the operating pH and HRT. The immobilized activated sludge system may be useful for the removal of nitrate from groundwater.', 22744691: 'A bacterial strain, FBHYA2, capable of degrading naphthalene, was isolated from the American Petroleum Institute (API) separator of the Tehran Oil Refinery Complex (TORC). Strain FBHYA2 was identified as Achromobacter sp. based on physiological and biochemical characteristics and also phylogenetic similarity of 16S rRNA gene sequence. The optimal growth conditions for strain FBHYA2 were pH 6.0, 30 °C and 1.0% NaCl. Strain FBHYA2 can utilize naphthalene as the sole source of carbon and energy and was able to degrade naphthalene aerobically very fast, 48 h for 96% removal at 500 mg/L concentration. The physiological response of Achromobacter sp., FBHYA2 to several hydrophobic chemicals (aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons) was also investigated. No biosurfactant was detected during bacterial growth on any aliphatic/aromatic hydrocarbons. The results of hydrophobicity measurements showed no significant difference between naphthalene- and LB-grown cells. The capability of the strain FBHYA2 to degrade naphthalene completely and rapidly without the need to secrete biosurfactant may make it an ideal candidate to remediate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-contaminated sites.', 22760225: 'A new arsenite-oxidizing bacterium was isolated from a low arsenic-containing (8.8 mg kg(-1)) soil. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that the strain was closely related to Stenotrophomonas panacihumi. Batch experiment results showed that the strain completely oxidized 500 μM of arsenite to arsenate within 12 h of incubation in a minimal salts medium. The optimum initial pH range for arsenite oxidation was 5-7. The strain was found to tolerate as high as 60 mM arsenite in culture media. The arsenite oxidase gene was amplified by PCR with degenerate primers. The deduced amino acid sequence showed the highest identity (69.1 %) with the molybdenum containing large subunit of arsenite oxidase derived from Bosea sp. Furthermore the amino acids involved in binding the substrate arsenite, were conserved with the arsenite oxidases of other arsenite oxidizing bacteria such as Alcaligenes feacalis and Herminnimonas arsenicoxydans. To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first report on arsenite oxidation using Stenotrophomonas sp. and the strain has great potential for application in arsenic remediation of contaminated water.', 22770974: 'The aim of present work was to bioremediate the waste cooking oil using a novel lipase produced in solid medium containing waste grease and wheat bran by Penicillium chrysogenum. Enzyme extracted with phosphate buffer was purified 10.6 and 26.28-fold after 90% ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography, respectively. The partial characterization of enzyme revealed its K(m) and V(max) value for p-nitrophenolpamitate as 0.4mM and 47.61 U/ml, respectively. The relative molecular mass of lipase was 40 kDa by SDS-PAGE and confirmed by zymogram. Purified lipase was most stable at 40°C and at 8.0 pH. Lipase activity was enhanced by metal ions such as Mg(2+), Fe(2+), Ca(2+) and non-ionic surfactant TritonX-100, while suppressed in the presence of SDS. Crude lipase was applied on cooking oil waste and the acid value was 26.92 mg/g. This showed that the enzyme could be employed for the bioremediation of used cooking oil.', 22776258: 'The successful application of bioaugmentation is largely dependent on the selective enrichment of culture with regards to pH, temperature, salt, or specific toxic organic pollutants. In this study, we investigated the effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (aerobic, >2 mg L(-1); microaerobic, <1 mg L(-1)) on yeast enrichment culture for bioaugmentation of acidic industrial wastewater (pH 3.9-4.7). Clone library analyses revealed that the yeast community shifted in response to different DO levels, and that Candida humilis and Candida pseudolambica were individually dominant in the aerobic and microaerobic enrichment cultures. This would significantly influence the isolation results, and further hinder bioaugmentation due to differences in DO environments during the enrichment and application periods. However, differences in the selective enrichment culture cannot be predicted based on differences in pollutant removal performance. Thus, DO concentrations (aerobic/microaerobic) should be considered a secondary selective pressure to achieve successful bioaugmentation.', 22784960: 'The effect of two additives on anaerobic monodigestion of pig slaughterhouse waste was studied in three laboratory scale continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) operated for 242-284 days at 35°C. A higher organic loading rate (OLR), namely 2.25 kg volatile solids (VS)/m(3)d with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 30 d was feasible with an additive containing Fe, HCl and trace elements while an OLR of 1.5 kg VS/m(3)d (HRT 30 d) led to instabilities in CSTR with an additive consisting of Fe and HCl and in CSTR without additives. Methane yields of ca. 700 dm(3) CH(4)/kg VS(fed) were obtained in all reactors under stable conditions. Both additives decreased H(2)S concentration of the biogas below detection limit 0.5 ppm while in a control reactor H(2)S concentration was up to 1900 ppm. In conclusion, the results suggest the possibility that additives may facilitate higher OLRs in monodigestion of pig slaughterhouse waste.', 22784963: 'Biological reduction of Fe(III)EDTA is one of the key steps in nitrogen oxides removal in the integrated approach of metal chelate absorption combined with microbial reduction. Paracoccus denitrificans ZGL1 was used as a model bacterium to evaluate the process of Fe(III)EDTA reduction by such microorganisms that could carry out the simultaneous reduction of NO chelated by Fe(II)EDTA (Fe(II)EDTA-NO) and Fe(III)EDTA. Enzymes analysis indicated Fe(III)EDTA reductase of ZGL1 was located both in the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. Glucose was identified as the most efficient electron donor for Fe(III)EDTA reduction. Better reduction performance was obtained with higher initial cell concentration corresponding to a specific reduction rate of 8.7 μmol h(-1) mg protein(-1). The presence of sulfate and thiosulfate had no influences on both cell growth and Fe(III)EDTA reduction. Fe(III)EDTA reduction rate and cell growth could be inhibited by addition of sulfite mainly due to its direct and indirect toxic effects.', 22791346: 'Bioremediation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) contaminated soils in the presence of heavy metals have proved to be difficult and often challenging due to the ability of toxic metals to inhibit PAH degradation by bacteria. In this study, a mixed bacterial culture designated as consortium-5 was isolated from a former manufactured gas plant (MGP) site. The ability of this consortium to utilise HMW PAHs such as pyrene and BaP as a sole carbon source in the presence of toxic metal Cd was demonstrated. Furthermore, this consortium has proven to be effective in degradation of HMW PAHs even from the real long term contaminated MGP soil. Thus, the results of this study demonstrate the great potential of this consortium for field scale bioremediation of PAHs in long term mix contaminated soils such as MGP sites. To our knowledge this is the first study to isolate and characterize metal tolerant HMW PAH degrading bacterial consortium which shows great potential in bioremediation of mixed contaminated soils such as MGP.', 22829863: 'Landfills leachates are known to contain recalcitrant and/or non-biodegradable organic substances and biological processes are not efficient in these cases. A promising alternative to complete oxidation of biorecalcitrant leachate is the use of ultrasonic process as pre-treatment to convert initially biorecalcitrant compounds to more readily biodegradable intermediates. The objectives of this study are to investigate the effect of ultrasonic process on biodegradability improvement. After the optimization by factorial design, the ultrasonic were applied in the treatment of raw leachates using a batch wise mode. For this, different scenarios were tested with regard to power intensities of 70 and 110 W, frequencies of 30, 45 and 60 KHz, reaction times of 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes and pH of 3, 7 and 10. For determining the effects of catalysts on sonication efficiencies, 5 mg/l of TiO(2) and ZnO have been also used. Results showed that when applied as relatively brief pre-treatment systems, the sonocatalysis processes induce several modifications of the matrix, which results in significant enhancement of its biodegradability. For this reason, the integrated chemical-biological systems proposed here represent a suitable solution for the treatment of landfill leachate samples.', 22842857: 'Organic and metallic pollutants are ubiquitous in the environment. Many metals are reported to be toxic to microorganisms and to inhibit biodegradation. The effect of the metals iron, copper and silver on the metabolism of Labrys portucalensis F11 and on fluorobenzene (FB) biodegradation was examined. The results indicate that the addition of 1\\xa0mM of Fe(2+) to the culture medium has a positive effect on bacterial growth and has no impact in the biodegradation of 1 and 2\\xa0mM of FB. The presence of 1\\xa0mM of Cu(2+) was found to strongly inhibit the growth of F11 cultures and to reduce the biodegradation of 1 and 2\\xa0mM of FB to ca. 50\\xa0%, with 80\\xa0% of stoichiometrically expected fluoride released. In the experiments with resting cells, the FB degraded (from 2\\xa0mM supplied) was reduced ca. 20\\xa0% whereas the fluoride released was reduced to 45\\xa0% of that stoichiometrically expected. Ag(+) was the most potent inhibitor of FB degradation. In experiments with growing cells, the addition of 1\\xa0mM of Ag(+) to the culture medium containing 1 and 2\\xa0mM of FB resulted in no fluoride release, whereas FB degradation was only one third of that observed in control cultures. In the experiments with resting cells, the addition of Ag(+) resulted in 25\\xa0% reduction in substrate degradation and fluoride release was only 20\\xa0% of that stoichiometrically expected. The accumulation of catechol and 4-fluorocatechol in cultures supplemented with Cu(2+) or Ag(+) suggest inhibition of the key enzyme of FB metabolism-catechol 1,2-dioxygenase.', 2287033: 'The biodegradation of chloramphenicol was studied by incubating the drug (at concentrations of 72, 48 and 24 micrograms/ml) with ruminal fluid samples from dwarf goats fed two different diets. Biodegradation of the drug was much faster in samples from animals which were fed with hay and concentrate than in those obtained from goats which were fed grass pellets only. Recently, it has been suggested that lysine-vasopressin injected intravenously induces closure of the oesophageal groove in cattle and goats. Therefore, the influence of lysine-vasopressin on the oral absorption of chloramphenicol (50 mg/kg body wt) was studied in dwarf goats, using two formulations of chloramphenicol. The results suggest that vasopressin failed to induce this reflex mechanism. Furthermore, the shapes of the plasma concentration-time curves after oral administration of chloramphenicol palmitate and chloramphenicol dissolved in propylene glycol were markedly different. Possible mechanisms for the observed differences are discussed.', 22893954: 'We investigated the biodegradation of 2-nitrophenol (2-NP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), and 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) in the rhizosphere of Spirodela polyrrhiza plants by conducting degradation experiments with three river water samples supplemented with each nitrophenol (NP). We then isolated NP-degrading bacteria both from the S. polyrrhiza roots and from the river water. In the river water samples, removal of the three NP was accelerated in the presence of S. polyrrhiza plants. The three NPs persisted in an autoclaved solution with sterile plants suggests that NP removal was accelerated largely by bacterial NP biodegradation rather than by adsorption and uptake by the plants. We isolated 8 strains of NP-degrading bacteria: 6 strains from the S. polyrrhiza roots and 2 strains from river water without the plants. The 2-NP- and 2,4-DNP-degrading bacteria were isolated only from the S. polyrrhiza roots. The 4-NP-degrading bacteria different from those isolated from the river water samples were also found on S. polyrrhiza roots. The 2-NP- and 4-NP-degrading strains isolated from the roots utilized the corresponding NP (0.5 mmol/L) as the sole carbon and energy source. The 2,4-DNP-degrading strains isolated from the roots showed substantial 2,4-DNP-degrading activity, but the presence of other carbon and energy sources was required for their growth. The isolated NP-degrading bacteria from the roots must have contributed to the accelerated degradation of the three NPs in the rhizosphere of S. polyrrhiza. Our results suggested that rhizoremediation with S. polyrrhiza may be effective for NP-contaminated surface water.', 22893972: 'The contamination of soils by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is a widespread environmental problem and the remediation of PAHs from these areas has been a major concern. The effectiveness of many in situ bioremediation systems may be constrained by low contaminant bioavailability due to limited aqueous solubility or a large magnitude of sorption. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD) on bioaugmentation by Paracoccus sp. strain HPD-2 of an aged PAH-contaminated soil. When 10% (W/W) MCD amendment was combined with bioaugmentation by the PAH-degrading bacterium Paracoccus sp. strain HPD-2, the percentage degradation of total PAHs was significantly enhanced up to 34.8%. Higher counts of culturable PAH-degrading bacteria and higher soil dehydrogenase and soil polyphenol oxidase activities were observed in 10% (W/W) MCD-assisted bioaugmentation soil. This MCD-assisted bioaugmentation strategy showed significant increases (p < 0.05) in the average well color development (AWCD) obtained by the BIOLOG Eco plate assay, Shannon-Weaver index (H) and Simpson index (lambda) compared with the controls, implying that this strategy at least partially restored the microbiological functioning of the PAH-contaminated soil. The results suggest that MCD-aided bioaugmentation by Paracoccus sp. strain HPD-2 may be a promising practical bioremediation strategy for aged PAH-contaminated soils.', 22894107: 'The impacts of landfill leachate irrigation on methane oxidation activities and methane-consuming bacteria populations were studied by incubation of landfill cover soils with leachate and (NH4)2SO4 solution at different ammonium concentrations. The community structures and abundances of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were examined by PCR-DGGE and real-time PCR. Compared with the pure (NH4)2SO4 solution, leachate addition was found to have a positive effect on methane oxidation activity. In terms of the irrigation amount, ammonium in leachate was responsible for the actual inhibition of leachate. The extent of inhibitory effect mainly depended on its ammonium concentration. The suppression of the predominant methane-consuming bacteria, type I MOB, was responsible for the decreased methane oxidation activity by ammonium inhibition. Methane-consuming bacteria responded diversely in abundance to ammonium. The abundance of type I MOB decreased by fivefold; type II MOB showed stimulation response of fivefold magnification upon the first addition but lessened to be lower than the original level after the second addition; the amount of AOB was stimulated to increase for 20-30 times gradually. Accumulated nitrate from nitrification strengthened the ammonium inhibition on type I and type II MOB, as a result, repetitive irrigation was unfavorable for methane oxidation.', 22899179: 'Cultivation of the biofuel plant, hybrid giant Napier grass (HGN), in saline soil was investigated in a greenhouse study. The results show that HGN is a salt tolerant plant which can flourish in saline soil and product a large amount of biomass. The extensively developed fibrous root system of HGN plays a significant role in the uptake of sodium from saline soil so that both soil salinity and pH are reduced. Fibrous roots of HGN are well distributed in the soil below the surface, where the metabolism of the root system produces a gradient at the depth between 10 and 20 cm in soil salinity, pH and organic content. The degradation of the HGN by the biota within the soil results in an increase in nutrients and improved soil quality. The experimental results suggest that HGN adapts to saline soil, which is promising for phytoremediation of such soils. Additional advantages of HGN include the large biomass produced which can be used for renewable energy generation.', 22908636: 'The application of elemental sulphur (S) to heavy metal contaminated soils is a strategy to increase metal extraction by plants. Here, we examined to which degree the efficiency of phytoextraction could be enhanced by increasing the S application rate on afield where S had already been applied for 6 years. For this purpose, the field experiment was continued for another two years doubling the S application rate on half of the S treatment plots, while continuing application at the previous rate on the other half. Doubling the application rate significantly accelerated the dissolution of calcite and the decrease in soil pH and also increased cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) uptake by sunflower and tobacco. But even in a best-case-scenario remediation of the site would still take more than a century. The results indicate that we reached the maximum potential of S application to enhance metal phytoextraction on the study site. Further decrease in pH by additional S applications would bear an excessive risk of decreasing yields and increasing metal leaching out of the root zone.', 22908637: 'Scirpus triqueter (Triangular club-rush), a typical wetland species, is used to study the response characteristics to pyrene. A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the growth parameters (height, diameter, shoot number, total volume, underground biomass, above-ground biomass and total biomass), and enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase) of S. triqueter. The characteristics of soil enzymes (catalase and polyphenol oxidase) and microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) were also assessed after pyrene treatment. Elevated pyrene concentration (80 mgkg(-1)) in the soil reduced the shoot number and biomass significantly, especially at the early growth stage. In root tissue, the enzyme catalase was activated at 80 mgkg(-1) of pyrene. Compared to roots, shoots had higher enzyme activities. Catalase activities in the rhizosphere increased throughout the growth period of S. triqueter. Polyphenol oxidase activities in the rhizosphere were higher than those in the bulk soil and unplanted soil. The populations of bacteria (total bacteria, pyrene-tolerant bacteria, and actinomyces) and fungi decreased under the stress of high pyrene concentration, while that of pyrene-tolerant bacteria increased with the increasing pyrene concentration. The presence of pyrene did not benefit the growth of S. triqueter. S. triqueter and soil enzymes varied within the growth stages. The presence of S. triqueter could improve the activity of soil enzymes and facilitate the propagation of microorganisms which could help eliminate pyrene contamination.', 22908638: 'The effects of the combined application of soil fungicide (benomyl) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on lead (Pb) phytoextraction by ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were examined. Twenty-five pots of Pb-contaminated soil (200 mg Pb kg(-1)) were seeded with ryegrass and randomly arranged into the following treatments: (1) Control, (2) benomyl, (3) EDTA, (4) benomyl and EDTA (B+E), and (5) benomyl followed by an application of EDTA 14 days later (B .. . E). Chemicals were applied when plants had reached maximum growth. Plants were analyzed for foliage Pb concentration using inductively coupled argon plasma (ICAP) spectrometry. The synergistic effects of the combined benomyl and EDTA application (treatments 4 and 5) were made evident by the significantly (p < 0.05) highest foliage Pb concentrations. However, the foliage dry biomass was significantly lowest for plants in treatments 4 and 5. The bioaccumulation factor (BF) and phytoextraction ratio (PR) were highest for plants in treatment 5 followed by plants in treatment 4.', 22908653: 'The effects of chitosan, a fishery waste-based material, and its derivative glutaraldehyde cross-linked chitosan (chitosan-GLA) on metal uptake by Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Brassica napus (rapeseed) were studied in a greenhouse pot experiment. Metal uptake by perennial ryegrass was highly dependent on the rate of addition of the chitosans. Low application rate (1% w/w) enhanced metal uptake, whereas 10% (w/w) addition decreased metal uptake. It was estimated that chitosan 1% (w/w) treatment could assist perennial ryegrass to remove approximately 3.2 kg Zn/ha and 0.29 kg Pb/ha. For rapeseed, metal uptake was decreased at all rates of application of chitosans. The ammonium acetate extractable metals in soil decreased following application of chitosans and plant growth.', 22911586: 'The herbicide propanil has long been used in rice  production in southern Brazil. Bacteria isolated from contaminated soils in  Massaranduba, Santa Catarina, Brazil, were found to be able to grow in the  presence of propanil, using this compound as a carbon source. Thirty strains  were identified as Pseudomonas (86.7%), Serratia (10.0%), and Acinetobacter (3.3%), based on phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA. Little genetic  diversity was found within species, more than 95% homology, suggesting that  there is selective pressure to metabolize propanil in the microbial community.  Two strains of Pseudomonas (AF7 and AF1) were selected in bioreactor  containing chemotactic growth medium, with the highest degradation activity of  propanil exhibited by strain AF7, followed by AF1 (60 and 40%, respectively).  These strains when encapsulated in alginate exhibited a high survival rate and  were able to colonize the rice root surfaces. Inoculation with Pseudomonas strains  AF7 and AF1 significantly improved the plant height of rice. Most of the Pseudomonas strains produced indoleacetic acid, soluble mineral phosphate, and fixed  nitrogen. These bacterial strains could potentially be used for the  bioremediation of propanil-contaminated soils and the promotion of plant  growth.', 22939188: 'Anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonate (2,7-AQDS), anthraquinone-1-sulfonate (α-AQS), anthraquinone-2-sulfonate (AQS), anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) and anthraquinone-1,5-disulfonate (1,5-AQDS) were selected as redox mediators for Cr(VI) reduction by Escherichia coli BL21. In the presence of 0.8mmoll(-1) AQS, the Cr(VI) reduction efficiency was 98.5% in 7.5h, whereas it was only 21-34% in the absence of a mediator or in the presence of α-AQS, 1,5-AQDS, AQDS, 2,7-AQDS. A linear correlation, k=0.768C(AQS)+1.5531 (R(2)=0.9935), was found for the reaction constant, k (mg Cr(VI) g(-1) dry cell weight h(-1)) and the AQS concentration (C(AQS)). The Arrhenius equation described the Cr(VI) reduction in the tested temperature range, and the pre-exponential factor A was 13.249mg Cr(VI) g(-1) dry cell weight h(-1),and the activation energy Ea was 28.01kJmol(-1). Glucose was the best carbon sources, and the optimum pH was 6.0. The Cr(VI) reduction rate obtained with AQS is a significant improvement over low conventional anaerobic reduction rates.', 22940296: 'In order to better understand how surfactants affect biodegradation of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs), Tween 80 and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), were selected to investigate effects on cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH), electron transport system (ETS) activities and phenanthrene biodegradation by Citrobacter sp. SA01. Tween 80 and SDBS increased CSH by 19.8-25.2%, ETS activities by 352.1-376.0μmol/gmin, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase (C12) activities by 50.8-52.7U/L, and phenanthrene biodegradation by 8.9-17.2% separately in the presence of 50mg/L of surfactants as compared to in their absence. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) release was 334.7μg/mg in the presence of both surfactants whereas in their absence only 8.6-44.4μg/mg of LPS was released. Thus, enhanced LPS release probably increased ETS and C12 activities as well as phenanthrene biodegradation by increasing CSH. The results demonstrate that surfactant-enhanced CSH provides a simple, yet effective strategy for field applications of surfactant-enhanced bioremediation of HOCs.', 22940300: 'The cold adaptability of microorganisms with different carbon source under 5°C was studied in activated sludge for treating synthetical wastewater. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis indicated contents of unsaturated fatty acids in cell membrane at 5°C were 13.66% and 24.96% higher for glucose and sodium acetate source than that at 25°C. PLFA biomarkers showed more Gram-negative bacteria enriched than Gram-positive bacteria in low-temperature activated sludge. The Shannon-Wiener diversity analysis demonstrated glucose fed reactor in low temperature had lower PLFA diversity index (1.21-1.30) than that at 25°C and sodium acetate source was reverse (1.08-0.69). The 16S rRNA analysis manifested certain microbes were considerably suitable for existence under cold environment, most of which belong to Gram-negative bacteria.', 22940303: 'The single chamber microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were used to treat steroidal drug production wastewater (SPW) and generate electricity simultaneously. The results indicated that the maximum COD removal efficiency reached 82%, total nitrogen and sulfate removal rate approached 62.47% and 26.46%, respectively. The maximum power density and the Coulombic efficiency reached to 22.3Wm(-3) and 30%, respectively. The scanning electron microscope showed that the dominant microbial populations were remarkably different in morphology on the surface of SPW and acetate-fed anodes. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles revealed that the microbial community structure fed with different concentrations of SPW presented a gradual succession and unique bacterial sequences were detected on the SPW and acetate-fed anodes. This research demonstrates that MFCs fed with SPW achieved a high efficiency of power density and simultaneous nutrient removal, and the dominant microorganisms on the anode were related to the types and the concentrations of substrates.', 22940306: 'A combined biological process was investigated for effective textile wastewater treatment. The process consisted of a first step performed by selected fungal biomasses, mainly devoted to the effluent decolourisation, and of a subsequent stage by means of activated sludge, in order to reduce the remaining COD and toxicity. In particular, the treatment with Trametes pubescens MUT 2400, selected over nine strains, achieved very good results in respect to all parameters. The final scale-up phase in a moving bed bioreactor with the supported biomass of the fungus allowed to verify the effectiveness of the treatment with high volumes. Despite promising results, further steps must be taken in order to optimize the use of these biomasses for a full exploitation of their oxidative potential in textile wastewater treatment.', 22940324: 'A comprehensive and global sensitivity analysis was conducted under a range of operating conditions. The relative importance of mass transfer resistance versus kinetic parameters was studied and found to depend on the operating regime as follows: Operating under the optimal loading ratio of 1.90(gO(2)/m(3)/d)/(gN/m(3)/d), the system was influenced by mass transfer (10% impact on nitrogen removal) and performance was limited by AOB activity (75% impact on nitrogen removal), while operating above, AnAOB activity was limiting (68% impact on nitrogen removal). The negative effect of oxygen mass transfer had an impact of 15% on nitrogen removal. Summarizing such quantitative analyses led to formulation of an optimal operation window, which serves a valuable tool for diagnosis of performance problems and identification of optimal solutions in nitritation/anammox applications.', 22940340: 'A bacterial consortium-AVS, consisting of Pseudomonas desmolyticum NCIM 2112, Kocuria rosea MTCC 1532 and Micrococcus glutamicus NCIM 2168 was formulated chemometrically, using the mixture design matrix based on the design of experiments methodology. The formulated consortium-AVS decolorized acid blue 15 and methylene blue with a higher average decolorization rate, which is more rapid than that of the pure cultures. The UV-vis spectrophotometric, Fourier transform infra red spectrophotometric and high performance liquid chromatographic analysis confirm that the decolorization was due to biodegradation by oxido-reductive enzymes, produced by the consortium-AVS. The toxicological assessment of plant growth parameters and the chlorophyll pigment concentrations of Phaseolus mungo and Triticum aestivum seedlings revealed the reduced toxic nature of the biodegraded products.', 22959131: '\"Assisted phytoextraction\" involving application of chemical additives such as plant growth regulators (PGRs) has become a trend in phytoremediation technology. This study identifies a cost-effective, naturally available crude PGR (PGR1) that produces the same effects as the commercial PGR (PGR2), increasing metal uptake by plants and the reduction of metal stress. Assisted phytoextraction by pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) from a multi-metal (Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Na and Zn) contaminated soil medium with tannery solid waste (TSW) soil amendments of 5 and 10%, was evaluated in a full-factorial pot trial with PGR1, PGR2 and Trichoderma pseudokoningii as factors. The effects of these phytoextraction assistants were measured through dry biomass production, heavy metal uptake, stress tolerance enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), soluble protein content of plant, and phytoextraction efficiency. Dry biomass and multi-metal accumulation were the highest in the soil treatments with a combined application of PGR1, PGR2 and T. pseudokoningii and the lowest in the control. The soluble protein contents and the SOD and CAT values were the highest in the 10% TSW treatment provided with PGR2+T. pseudokoningii, while the lowest were in the control. Thus, application of crude PGR in combination with other phytoextraction assistants can increase biomass production as well as multi-metal accumulation in plants. However, the biochemical properties of the plant depend on the level of TSW stress in the soil treatment as well as the type of phytoextraction assistants.', 22960123: \"An extracellular laccase-producing yeast was isolated from soil and identified as Yarrowia lipolytica by its morphology and by comparison of its internal transcribed spacer rDNA gene sequence. Extracellular laccase (YlLac) from Y. lipolytica was purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. YlLac is a monomeric glycoprotein with 14% carbohydrate content and a molecular mass of 67kDa. It showed a higher catalytic efficiency towards 2,2'-Azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (k(cat)/K(m)=19.3s(-1)μM(-1)) and 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (k(cat)/K(m)=13s(-1)μM(-1)) than any other reported laccase. This enzyme was able to oxidize phenolic compounds present in pretreated rice straw. Several parameters (temperature, enzyme concentration, and mediator compounds) to enhance removal of phenolic compounds from pretreated rice straw were optimized using response surface methodology. The use of YlLac for the removal of cellulase inhibitory compounds from biomass slurries was found to be a promising approach for improving the efficiency of biorefineries.\", 22975652: 'In a soil microcosm experiment, the influence of low-level (137)Cs and (90)Sr contamination on the degradation of (14)C-ring-labeled 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was studied. Two differently treated soils (one native soil and one soil sterilized and reinoculated with a biotic soil aliquot) were artificially contaminated with various concentrations of (137)Cs and (90)Sr as nitrate salts. The cumulative doses increased up to 4 Gy for 30 days of incubation in soil microcosms. Changes in microbial community structure were observed with help of the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). A radiation-induced impact appeared only in the microcosms treated with 30 times the maximum contamination appearing in the exclusion zone around reactor 4 in Chernobyl. In contrast to the less contaminated soils, the mineralization of 2,4-D was delayed for 4 days before it recovered. Slight shifts in the microbial communities could be traced to radiation effects. However, other parameters had a major impact on mineralization and community structure. Thus the sterilization and reinoculation and, of course, application of the 2,4-D were predominantly reflected in the (14)CO(2) emissions and the DGGE gel patterns.', 22981745: 'A stable four-member bacterial consortium, DNC5 that was capable of metabolizing atrazine was isolated from corn-planted soil. The main objective of this paper is to characterize the individual metabolic characteristics and the mutualism of the cultivable members in the consortium DNC5. Substrates utilizing character of each community member indicate that the primary organism in this consortium is Arthrobacter sp. DNS10, which was the only strain capable of mineralizing atrazine to cyanuric acid. Two secondary strains (Bacillus subtilis DNS4 and Variovorax sp. DNS12) utilized cyanuric acid during the atrazine degradation process. Meanwhile, we found that a metabolite (isopropylamine) inhibited the atrazine degrading species Arthrobacter sp. DNS10. The last strain (Arthrobacter sp. DNS9) of this consortium played a role in reducing this inhibition by utilizing isopropylamine for its growth. Altogether this is a new combination of isolates in an atrazine degrading consortium. The growth and the degradation rate of consortium DNC5 were faster than that of the single strain DNS10. The high degradation ability of the consortium showed good potential for atrazine biodegradation. This study will contribute toward a better understanding about metabolic activities of atrazine degrading consortium, which are generally considered to be responsible for atrazine mineralization in the natural environment.', 22989923: \"Surface properties of newly isolated Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain 6 were tested. The bacteria were stored in two different ways to determine the influence of hydrocarbons and surfactants on surface and enzymatic characteristics of the isolated strain. The influence of surface active agents, natural and synthetic, on membrane's lipid composition and cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) was investigated. Our results indicate that long-term contact with diesel oil as a hydrophobic sole carbon source leads to the increased enzymatic activity of S. maltophilia strain 6 as well as to modification of fatty acids profiles and its facility to adhere to hydrophobic compounds. Among surfactants there were saponins and Triton X-100 which changed the composition of fatty acids the most, increasing the amount of branched acids. The comparison of fatty acid profiles with CSH of systems with diesel oil, rhamnolipids, saponins and Triton X-100 points out that the growing amount of hydroxy fatty acids corresponds to lower hydrophobicity. Moreover, CSH is a dynamic parameter which can change during cultivation of microorganisms.\", 23073089: 'The effects of different surfactants (SDBS, C(14)BDMA, Tween20) on the sorption of nickel(II) onto aerobic activated sludge were studied. Results showed that the influence of surfactants on the adsorption of nickel(II) strongly depended on the type of the surfactants. The presence of SDBS enhanced nickel(II) sorption, in contrast, the presence of C(14)BDMA and Tween20 both caused a nickel(II) sorption reduction, but Tween20 had a slighter effect. With the presence of individual surfactant, the sorption kinetics and isotherms were good agreement with pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm, respectively. The surfactant impelled the nickel(II) adsorption process onto aerobic activated sludge to transform from chemisorption to physisorption, and the existence of SDBS in solution even changed the exothermic nature. From FT-IR measurements and zeta potential measurements, there was competitive relationship between C(14)BDMA and nickel(II) at the adsorption onto sludge.', 23073092: 'The characterization of a spore laccase from Bacillus vallismortis fmb-103, isolated from textile industry disposal sites, is described. The activity was 6.5 U/g of dry spore with ABTS as the substrate. The enzyme was quite stable at high temperature. It retained more than 90% of its initial activity after 10h at 70 °C. The enzyme demonstrated broad pH stability in both acidic and alkaline conditions. There was almost no activity loss at pH 3 over an extended period of time, and the relative activity remained at 82% and 38% at pH 7 and pH 9 after 10 days. NaN(3), SDS, L-cysterine, Dithiothreitol, EDTA and NaCl inhibit the enzyme activity. Triphenylmethane dyes, including malachite green, brilliant green and aniline blue were efficiently degraded by the enzyme after 24h in combination with a mediator with efficiencies of 76.84%, 96.56% and 81.17%, respectively. The reusability of spore laccase for decolorization dyes was also examined.', 23098583: 'An experimental investigation was carried out to determine the effect of glyphosate-containing herbicides (GCHs) on the hydrocarbon retention and biodegradation processes known to occur in pervious pavement systems (PPSs). The PPS test rigs were based on the four-layered design detailed in CIRIA C582. This enabled the pollutant retention capacity of the PPS and biodegradation of retained pollutants by microorganisms to be investigated. The use of test rigs also enabled the impact of GCH on PPS eukaryotic organisms to be studied, by the monitoring of protist bioindicators. Results showed that GCH disrupted hydrocarbon retention by the geotextiles relative to rigs with mineral oil only added, as 9.3% and 24.5% of added hydrocarbon were found in herbicide only rigs and herbicide plus oil rigs respectively. In previous studies, PPS contaminated by mineral oil had been shown to retain 98.7% of added oils and over several weeks, biodegrade this oil in situ. Where GCH was added to experimental models, much higher concentrations of heavy metals, including Pb, Cu, and Zn, were released from the PPS in effluent, particularly where GCH and mineral oil were added together. The source of the majority of the metal contamination was thought to be the used engine oil. The herbicide generally increased the total activity of microbial communities in rig systems and had a stimulating effect on bacterial and fungal population numbers. Although the protists, which are part of the microbial community directly or indirectly responsible for biodegradation, were initially strongly affected by the herbicide, they showed resilience by quickly recovering and increasing their population compared with rigs without added herbicide, including the rigs with mineral oil added to them. However, the presence of herbicide was associated with a decrease in the species richness of recorded protist taxa and a predominance of robust, cosmopolitan or ubiquitous protist genera.', 23107290: 'Bioremediation of surface waters contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is a serious problem, often limited by the low bioavailability of contaminants as a result of their low aqueous solubility. In this study, we studied the influence of hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPCD) addition on the biodegradation of dissolved pyrene in aqueous solution. Five types of unidentified bacterial strains were used with a concentration of pyrene under its solubility limit. The reduction of pyrene content was monitored during the biodegradation process using synchronous fluorimetry. The presence of HPCD changed the rate of pyrene biodegradation by microorganisms due to the formation of an inclusion complex between pyrene and HPCD. The hydrophobicity and the emulsifying activity of microorganisms relative to their biodegrading capacity were investigated. The results indicated that hydrophobicity and emulsifying activity of the microorganisms were important factors that can influence the biodegradation process. The hydrophobicity and emulsifying activity were strongly correlated with the biodegrading capacity of the microorganisms toward pyrene in the presence of solubilizing agents or organized media.', 23131641: 'This study investigated ways of stimulating the biodegradation rates of the commonly applied herbicide, 3,4-dichloropropionanilide (propanil), and its metabolite, 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA), as well as the growth rate of propanil- and DCA-degrading organisms in a mixed culture. Propionate, the other metabolite of propanil, stimulated the specific degradation rates of both propanil and DCA after a brief acclimation period. A metabolic model developed to characterise the metabolism of propanil and DCA biodegradation showed that the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation (i.e. P/O ratio), which measures the metabolic efficiency, increased over time by 6- to 10-fold. This increase was accompanied by a 5- to 10-fold increase in the propanil and DCA biodegradation degradation rates. The biodegradation rates of the culture were unaffected when using an irrigation water matrix (Tejo river, Portugal), highlighting the utility of the culture for bioaugmentation purposes.', 23164624: 'A 15-week treatability study was conducted in a greenhouse to evaluate the potential effects of molasses on the bioremediation and phytoremediation potential of Guinea Grass (Panicum maximum) for treating energetic contaminated soil from the open burn/open detonation area of the Makua Military Reservation, Oahu, HI (USA). The energetics in the soil were royal demolition explosive (RDX) and high-melting explosive (HMX). Among the 6 treatments employed in this study, enhanced removal of RDX was observed from treatments that received molasses and went to completion. The RDX degradation rates in treatments with molasses diluted 1:20 and 1:40 were comparable suggesting that the lower dose worked as well as the higher dose. Treatments without molasses degraded RDX slowly and residuals remained after 15 weeks. The bacterial densities in molasses-treated units were much greater than those without molasses. Phytoremediation alone seems to have little effect on RDX disappearance. For HMX, neither bioremediation nor phytoremediation was found to be useful in reducing the concentration within the experimental period. The concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous in the soil did not change significantly during the experiment, however, a slight increase in soil pH was observed in all treatments. The study showed that irrigating with diluted molasses is effective at enhancing RDX degradation mainly in the root zone and just below it. The long term sustainability of active training ranges can be enhanced by bioremediation using molasses treatments to prevent RDX deposited by on-going operations from migrating through the soil to groundwater and off-site.', 23168632: 'Eucalyptus bleached kraft pulp production, an important sector of the Brazilian national economy, is responsible for generating large volume, high pollutant load effluents, containing a considerable fraction of recalcitrant organic matter. The objectives of this study were to quantify the biological activity of the effluent from a eucalyptus bleached kraft pulp mill, characterize the nature of compounds responsible for biological activity and assess the effect of ozone treatment on its removal. Primary and secondary effluents were collected bimonthly over the course of one year at a Brazilian bleached eucalypt kraft pulp mill and their pollutant loads (biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), adsorbable organic halogen (AOX), lignin, extractives) and biological activity (acute and chronic toxicity and estrogenic activity) quantified. The effluent studied did not present acute toxicity to Daphnia, but presented the chronic toxicity effects of algal growth inhibition and reduced survival and reproduction in Ceriodaphnia, as well as estrogenic activity. Chronic toxicity and estrogenic activity were reduced but not eliminated during activated sludge biological treatment. The toxicity identification evaluation revealed that lipophilic organic compounds (such as residual lignin, extractives and their byproducts) were responsible for the toxicity and estrogenic activity. Ozone treatment (50 mg/L O(3)) of the secondary effluent eliminated the chronic toxicity and significantly reduced estrogen activity.', 23201830: 'Heavy metal pollution often occurs together with organic contaminants. Brassinosteroids (BRs) induce plant tolerance to several abiotic stresses, including phenanthrene (PHE) and cadmium (Cd) stress. However, the role of BRs in PHE+Cd co-contamination-induced stress amelioration is unknown. Here, the interactive effects of PHE, Cd, and 24-epibrassinolide (EBR; a biologically active BR) were investigated in tomato plants. The application of Cd (100 µM) alone was more phytotoxic than PHE applied alone (100 µM); however, their combined application resulted in slightly improved photosynthetic activity and pigment content compared with Cd alone after a 40 d exposure. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species and membrane lipid peroxidation were induced by PHE and/or Cd; however, the differences in effect were insignificant between Cd and PHE+Cd. The foliar application of EBR (0.1 µM) to PHE- and/or Cd-stressed plants alleviated photosynthetic inhibition and oxidative stress by causing enhancement of the activity of the enzymes and related transcript levels of the antioxidant system, secondary metabolism, and the xenobiotic detoxification system. Additionally, PHE and/or Cd residues were significantly decreased in both the leaves and roots after application of EBR, more specifically in PHE+Cd-stressed plants when treated with EBR, indicating a possible improvement in detoxification of these pollutants. The findings thus suggest a potential interaction of EBR and PHE for Cd stress alleviation. These results advocate a positive role for EBR in reducing pollutant residues for food safety and also strengthening phytoremediation.', 23202280: 'Nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) has potential for the remediation of organochlorine-contaminated environments. Environmental safety concerns associated with in situ deployment of nZVI include potential negative impacts on indigenous microbes whose biodegradative functions could contribute to contaminant remediation. With respect to a two-step polychlorinated biphenyl remediation scenario comprising nZVI dechlorination followed by aerobic biodegradation, we examined the effect of polyacrylic acid (PAA)-coated nZVI (mean diameter = 12.5 nm) applied at 10 g nZVI kg(-1) to Aroclor-1242 contaminated and uncontaminated soil over 28 days. nZVI had a limited effect on Aroclor congener profiles, but, either directly or indirectly via changes to soil physico-chemical conditions (pH, Eh), nZVI addition caused perturbation to soil bacterial community composition, and reduced the activity of chloroaromatic mineralizing microorganisms. We conclude that nZVI addition has the potential to inhibit microbial functions that could be important for PCB remediation strategies combining nZVI treatment and biodegradation.', 23224907: 'Isobutanol is an alternate fuel additive that is being considered because of economic and lower emission benefits. However, future gasoline spills could result in co-contamination of isobutanol with gasoline components such as benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene and xylene. Hence, isobutanol could affect the degradability of gasoline components thereby having an effect on contaminant plume length and half-life. In this study, the effect of isobutanol on the biodegradation of a model gasoline component (toluene) was examined in laboratory microcosms. For this, toluene and isobutanol were added to six different toluene degrading laboratory microcosms under sulfate amended, nitrate amended or methanogenic conditions. While toluene biodegradation was not greatly affected in the presence of isobutanol in five out of the six different experimental sets, toluene degradation was completely inhibited in one set of microcosms. This inhibition occurred in sulfate amended microcosms constructed with inocula from wastewater treatment plant activated sludge. Our data suggest that toluene degrading consortia are affected differently by isobutanol addition. These results indicate that, if co-contamination occurs, in some cases the in situ half-life of toluene could be significantly extended.

The rate of nitrate removal by denitrification was increased by up to 2.6-fold by exposing phenol to photocatalysis for 30\\xa0min, although the rate decreased with increasing photocatalysis. The increased denitrification rate appeared to be associated with the photocatalytic production of carboxylic acids, but the slow down correlated to the production of catechol and hydroquinone.

Strains D6, D11 and D17 were allocated to Gram-positive actinomycetes, similar to previously reported metabolic 1,4-dioxane degrading bacteria, whereas strain D1 was allocated to Gram-negative Afipia sp. The isolated strains could utilize a variety of carbon sources, including cyclic ethers, especially those with carbons at position 2 that were modified with methyl- or carbonyl-groups. The cell yields on 1,4-dioxane were relatively low (0.179-0.223\\xa0mg-protein (mg-1,4-dioxane)(-1)), which was likely due to requiring energy for C-O bond fission. The isolated strains showed 2.6-13 times higher specific 1,4-dioxane degradation rates (0.052-0.263\\xa0mg-1,4-dioxane (mg-protein)(-1) h(-1)) and 2.3-7.8 fold lower half saturation constants (20.6-69.8\\xa0mg\\xa0L(-1)) than the most effective 1,4-dioxane degrading bacterium reported to date, Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190, suggesting high activity and affinity toward 1,4-dioxane degradation. Strains D1 and D6 possessed inducible 1,4-dioxane degrading enzymes, whereas strains D11 and D17 possessed constitutive ones. 1,4-Dioxane degradation (100\\xa0mg\\xa0L(-1)) by Afipia sp. D1 was not affected by the co-existence of up to 3,000\\xa0mg\\xa0L(-1) of ethylene glycol. The effects of initial pH, incubation temperature and NaCl concentration on 1,4-dioxane degradation by the four strains revealed that they could degrade 1,4-dioxane under a relatively wide range of conditions, suggesting that they have a certain adaptability and applicability for industrial wastewater treatment.

The biosorption was studied on Ca-alginate beads, on non-living mycelial pellets of Phanerochaete chrysosporium immobilized on Ca-alginate, and on free fungal biomass. Ph. chrysosporium was grown in a liquid medium containing mineral and vitamin materials with complex composition. The biosorption process followed pseudo second-order kinetics on all bioadsorbents. The bioadsorption-equilibrium on blank Ca-alginate, free and immobilized fungal biomass can be described by Langmuir, anti-Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models using nonlinear least-squares estimation.', 23251623: 'Depending on speciation, U environmental contamination may be spread through the environment or inversely restrained to a limited area. Induction of U precipitation via biogenic or non-biogenic processes would reduce the dissemination of U contamination. To this aim U oxidation/reduction processes triggered by bacteria are presently intensively studied. Using X-ray absorption analysis, we describe in the present article the ability of Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 and Rhodopseudomonas palustris, highly resistant to a variety of metals and metalloids or to organic pollutants, to withstand high concentrations of U and to immobilize it either through biosorption or through reduction to non-uraninite U(IV)-phosphate or U(IV)-carboxylate compounds. These bacterial strains are thus good candidates for U bioremediation strategies, particularly in the context of multi-pollutant or mixed-waste contaminations.', 23252798: 'A simple anaerobic upflow column system (15 cm long, 5 cm inner diameter) for complete pentachlorophenol (PCP) mineralization has been established using a microbial consortium requiring only lactate as the external nutrient. With lactate as an electron donor, PCP was dechlorinated to 3-chlorophenol (3-CP) and phenol. The degradation of 3-CP and phenol proceeded without an external electron acceptor, indicating fermentative or syntrophic characteristics. A tracer experiment using (14)C-U-ring-labeled PCP confirmed the conversion of PCP into CO(2) (54.1%), CH(4) (48.1%), and biomass (0.6%). The nitrogen required for degradation was supplied by N(2)-fixation, evidenced from the nitrogen balance and an acetylene reduction assay. A 16S rRNA gene library analysis showed that bottom of the upflow column harbored the potential dechlorinators, Dehalobacter and Desulfitobacterium, and the phenol/3-CP fermentative or syntrophic degraders, Cryptanaerobacter and Syntrophus. The nitrogen-fixing facultative anaerobes, Rhizobiales, were detected in the top of the upflow column, with other possible nitrogen-fixers at both bottom and top of the upflow column. The mineralization rate reached 1.96 μmoles L(-1) d(-1) for 50 μM of the initial PCP concentration: one of the highest efficiencies reported. This compact anaerobic mineralization system requiring no external supply of an electron acceptor would be useful for the remediation of chlorinated aromatic compounds under anaerobic conditions.', 23281888: 'Microbial dechlorination of trichloroethene (TCE) is inhibited at elevated TCE concentrations. A batch experiment and modeling analysis were performed to examine whether this self-inhibition is related to an enhanced cell decay or a reduced dechlorination activity at increasing TCE concentrations. The batch experiment combined four different initial TCE concentrations (1.4-3.0 mM) and three different inoculation densities (4.0 × 10(5) to 4.0 × 10(7)Geobacter cells·mL(-1)). Chlorinated ethene concentrations and Geobacter 16S rRNA gene copy numbers were measured. The time required for complete conversion of TCE to cis-DCE increased with increasing initial TCE concentration and decreasing inoculation density. Both an enhanced decay and a reduced activity model fitted the experimental results well, although the reduced activity model better described the lag phase and microbial decay in some treatments. In addition, the reduced activity model succeeded in predicting the reactivation of the dechlorination reaction in treatments in which the inhibiting TCE concentration was lowered after 80 days. In contrast, the enhanced decay model predicted a Geobacter cell density that was too low to allow recovery for these treatments. Conclusively, our results suggest that TCE self-inhibition is related to a reduced dechlorination activity rather than to an enhanced cell decay at elevated TCE concentrations.', 23281935: 'The development of rational and effective engineered bioremediation approaches for sites contaminated with chlorinated solvents requires a fundamental understanding of the factors limiting the in situ activity of dehalorespiring bacteria. Frequently, multiple dehalorespiring bacteria are present at contaminated sites, particularly when bioaugmentation is applied. The ecological interactions between different dehalorespiring populations can-along with hydrodynamic and other environmental factors-affect their activity and thus the rates and extent of dehalorespiration. An integrated experimental and modeling approach was used to evaluate the ecological interactions between two hydrogenotrophic, dehalorespiring strains. A dual Monod model of dehalorespiration provided a good fit to the chlorinated ethene concentrations measured in a coculture of Dehalococcoides mccartyi 195 and Dehalobacter restrictus growing on tetrachloroethene (PCE) and excess H(2) in a continuous-flow reactor. Inhibition of dehalorespiration by chlorinated ethenes was previously observed in cultures containing Dehalococcoides or Dehalobacter strains. Therefore, inhibition coefficients were estimated for Dhc. mccartyi 195 and Dhb. restrictus. The inhibition effects of PCE and TCE on VC dechlorination by Dhc. mccartyi 195, and of VC on PCE and TCE dechlorination by Dhb. restrictus, were compounded when these strains were grown in coculture, and dehalorespiring population abundance and survival could be accurately predicted only by incorporating these complex interactions into the dual Monod model.', 23285046: 'The versatile-peroxidase (VP) encoded by mnp4 is one of the nine members of the manganese-peroxidase (MnP) gene family that constitutes part of the ligninolytic system of the white-rot basidiomycete Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom). VP enzymes exhibit dual activity on a wide range of substrates. As Mn(2+) supplement to P. ostreatus cultures results in enhanced degradation of recalcitrant compounds and lignin, we examined the effect of Mn(2+) on the expression profile of the MnP gene family. In P. ostreatus (monokaryon PC9), mnp4 was found to be the predominantly expressed mnp in Mn(2+)-deficient media, whereas strongly repressed (to approximately 1%) in Mn(2+)-supplemented media. Accordingly, in-vitro Mn(2+)-independent activity was found to be negligible. We tested whether release of mnp4 from Mn(2+) repression alters the activity of the ligninolytic system. A transformant over-expressing mnp4 (designated OEmnp4) under the control of the β-tubulin promoter was produced. Now, despite the presence of Mn(2+) in the medium, OEmnp4 produced mnp4 transcript as well as VP activity as early as 4 days after inoculation. The level of expression was constant throughout 10 days of incubation (about 0.4-fold relative to β-tubulin) and the activity was comparable to the typical activity of PC9 in Mn(2+)-deficient media. In-vivo decolorization of the azo dyes Orange II, Reactive Black 5, and Amaranth by OEmnp4 preceded that of PC9. OEmnp4 and PC9 were grown for 2 weeks under solid-state fermentation conditions on cotton stalks as a lignocellulosic substrate. [(14)C]-lignin mineralization, in-vitro dry matter digestibility, and neutral detergent fiber digestibility were found to be significantly higher (about 25%) in OEmnp4-fermented substrate, relative to PC9. We conclude that releasing Mn(2+) suppression of VP4 by over-expression of the mnp4 gene in P. ostreatus improved its ligninolytic functionality.', 23292008: 'Phenol is a toxic aromatic compound used or produced in many industries and as a result a common component of industrial wastewaters. Phenol containing waste streams are frequently hypersaline and therefore require halophilic microorganisms for efficient biotreatment without dilution.

Genes encoding the aromatic dioxygenase enzymes catechol 1,2 dioxygenase and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase were present in all strains as determined by PCR amplification using primers specific for highly conserved regions of the genes. The gene for protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase was cloned from the isolated H. organivorans and the translated protein was evaluated by comparative protein sequence analysis with protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase proteins from other microorganisms. Although the analysis revealed a wide range of sequence divergence among the protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase family, all of the conserved domain amino acid structures identified for this enzyme family are identical or conservatively substituted in the H. organivorans enzyme.

Full ClO(4)(-) reduction was achieved by using a two-stage MBfR with controlled NO(3)(-) surface loadings to each stage. With an equivalent NO(3)(-) surface loading larger than 0.65 ± 0.04 g N/m(2)-day, the lead MBfR removed about 87 ± 4% of NO(3)(-) and 30 ± 8% of ClO(4)(-). This decreased the equivalent surface loading of NO(3)(-) to 0.34 ± 0.04-0.53 ± 0.03 g N/m(2)-day for the lag MBfR, in which ClO(4)(-) was reduced to nondetectable. SO(4)(2-) reduction was eliminated without compromising full ClO(4)(-) reduction using a higher flow rate that gave an equivalent NO(3)(-) surface loading of 0.94 ± 0.05 g N/m(2)-day in the lead MBfR and 0.53 ± 0.03 g N/m(2)-day in the lag MBfR. Results from qPCR and pyrosequencing showed that the lead and lag MBfRs had distinctly different microbial communities when SO(4)(2-) reduction took place. Denitrifying bacteria (DB), quantified using the nirS and nirK genes, dominated the biofilm in the lead MBfR, but perchlorate-reducing bacteria (PRB), quantified using the pcrA gene, became more important in the lag MBfR. The facultative anaerobic bacteria Dechloromonas, Rubrivivax, and Enterobacter were dominant genera in the lead MBfR, where their main function was to reduce NO(3)(-). With a small NO(3)(-) surface loading and full ClO(4)(-) reduction, the dominant genera shifted to ClO(4)(-)-reducing bacteria Sphaerotilus, Rhodocyclaceae, and Rhodobacter in the lag MBfR.', 23353093: 'The traditional biological aerobic treatment of domestic wastewater only reduces the pathogen load, biological oxygen demand (BOD), and chemical oxygen demand (COD) to some extent. Irradiation with electrons to 1kGy alone was found to be sufficient to eliminate all the pathogens, but no significant reduction in COD and BOD was observed. However, electron irradiation to 1kGy followed by the biological treatment resulted in more complete and faster reduction in the pathogen count, COD, and BOD than the biological treatment alone.', 23361127: 'Microbial pesticide degradation studies have until now mainly focused on bacteria, although fungi have also been shown to degrade pesticides. In this study we clarify the background for the ability of the common soil fungus Mortierella to degrade the phenylurea herbicide diuron. Diuron degradation potentials of five Mortierella strains were compared, and the role of carbon and nitrogen for the degradation process was investigated. Results showed that the ability to degrade diuron varied greatly among the Mortierella strains tested, and the strains able to degrade diuron were closely related. Degradation of diuron was fastest in carbon and nitrogen rich media while suboptimal nutrient levels restricted degradation, making it unlikely that Mortierella utilize diuron as carbon or nitrogen sources. Degradation kinetics showed that diuron degradation was followed by formation of the metabolites 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-methylurea, 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)urea and an hitherto unknown metabolite suggested to be 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-methylideneurea.

The biosurfactant was stable in high salinity (10\\xa0% w/v NaCl), elevated temperatures (120\\xa0°C for 15\\xa0min) and a wide pH range (2.0-10.0). The noticeable changes during biodegradation were decreased hydrophobicity; an increase in degree of fatty acid saturation, saturated/unsaturated ratio and cyclopropane fatty acid.

Product stoichiometry showed a carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mass balance of 37 and 35\\xa0%, respectively. Biodegradation of 4-NT proceeded by oxidation at the methyl group to form 4-nitrobenzoate, followed by reduction and hydrolytic deamination yielding protocatechuate, which was metabolized through β-ketoadipate pathway. In vitro and in vivo acute toxicity assays in adult rat (Rattus norvegicus) showed sequential detoxification and the order of toxicity was 4-NT >4-nitrobenzyl alcohol >4-nitrobenzaldehyde >4-nitrobenzoate > protocatechuate.

Although significant progress regarding the explanation of mechanisms behind biosurfactant-induced effects could be observed, there are still many factors which are not sufficiently elucidated. This corresponds to the fact that although positive influence of biosurfactants is often reported, there are also numerous cases where no or negative effect was observed.

Methane production from acetate was affected more by acetate than by ammonium until the ammonium concentration reached 6-7\\xa0g-N/L. When the ammonium concentration exceeded 6\\xa0g-N/L, ammonium inhibition was strengthened by the increased concentration of acetate. At a low acetate concentration (50\\xa0mmol/L), acetoclastic methanogenesis dominated, regardless of ammonium concentration. At higher acetate concentrations (150 and 250\\xa0mmol/L) and at low-medium ammonium levels (1-4\\xa0g-N/L), acetate was mainly degraded by acetoclastic methanogenesis, while residual acetate was degraded by a combination of acetoclastic methanogenesis and the syntrophic reaction of syntrophic acetate oxidization and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis with the latter dominating at 250\\xa0mmol/L acetate. At high ammonium levels (6-7\\xa0g-N/L), the degradation of acetate in the 150\\xa0mmol/L treatment was firstly through a combination of acetoclastic methanogenesis and the syntrophic pathway and then gradually shifted to the syntrophic pathway, while the degradation of acetate in the 250\\xa0mmol/L treatment was completely by the syntrophic pathway.', 23434805: 'In vitro degradation of pyrene was studied in MSM by three bacterial strains individually, designated as BP10, NJ2 and P2.

During pyrene degradation, catechol 1,2 dioxygenase (C12O) activity was induced by 13 folds in BP10 and 17 folds in P2 as compared to catechol 2,3 dioxygenase (C23O). However, in NJ2, C23O activity was augmented 1.3 times more than C12O. This clearly indicated that C12O played a major role in pyrene degradation by BP10 and P2, while in NJ2, C23O contributed more to degradation process than C12O.

The synthetic wastewater contained Cr(VI) (5-45 mg L(-1)), azo dye (Remazol Brilliant Violet 5R) (100-200 mg L(-1)), sulfate (2000 mg L(-1)) and ethanol or glucose (2000 mg L(-1) chemical oxygen demand (COD)). The robustness of two FBRs was assessed under varying Cr(VI) and azo dye loadings. Both reactors performed well in terms of COD, sulfate, color and Cr(VI) removals. However, ethanol-fed FBR performed better than glucose-fed one. The COD, sulfate, chromium and color removals at the highest Cr(VI) concentration (45 mg L(-1)) in ethanol-fed FBR were around 75%, 95%, 93%, and 99%, respectively. Further increase in influent Cr(VI) concentration adversely effected reactor performance. The COD, sulfate, chromium and color removals at 45 mg L(-1) Cr(VI) in glucose-fed FBR were around 60%, 50%, 93%, and 76%, respectively.', 23455956: 'Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) discharged with wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents are an emerging surface water quality concern. Biological transformation has been identified as an important removal mechanism during wastewater treatment. The aim of this research was the identification of bacteria with characteristics for potential bioaugmentation to enhance PPCP removal. We report here the cultivation and characterization of bacteria capable of degrading PPCPs to ng/L concentrations. An isolation approach was developed using serial enrichment in mineral medium containing 1\\xa0mg/L of an individual PPCP as the sole organic carbon source available to heterotrophs until the original activated sludge inocula was diluted to ~10(-8) of its initial concentration, followed by colony growth on solid R2A agar. Eleven bacteria were isolated, eight that could remove triclosan, bisphenol A, ibuprofen, or 17β-estradiol to below 10\\xa0ng/L, one that could remove gemfibrozil to below 60\\xa0ng/L, and two that could remove triclosan or E2, but not to ng/L concentrations. Most bacterial isolates degraded contaminants during early growth when grown utilizing rich carbon sources and were only able to degrade the PPCPs on which they were isolated. Seven of the bacterial isolates were sphingomonads, including all the triclosan and bisphenol A degraders and the ibuprofen degrader. The study results indicate that the isolated bacteria may have a positive influence on removal in WWTPs if present at sufficient concentrations and may be useful for bioaugmentation.

In this study, we investigated the degradation of melamine and its impact on activated sludge operations by employing two common activated sludge processes, namely the Modified Ludzack-Ettinger (MLE) process and the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) process. Melamine was dosed continuously from day 125 in both activated sludge treatment systems at an influent concentration of 3 mg/L for about 100 days. Even after such a long period of sludge adaptation, melamine appeared not to be easily biodegradable. The average melamine removal efficiencies in the CSTR and MLE systems were 14 ± 10% and 20 ± 15%, respectively. There was no significant difference in melamine removal between the two different activated sludge processes. The long-term input of melamine resulted in a decrease in the nitrifying bacterial activities (by 82 ± 8%) and population in both systems. Short-term microtiter assay results also showed that melamine reduced activated sludge growth by 80% when supplied at a concentration of 75.6 mg/L. These results suggest that sludge adaptation plays a minimal role in melamine degradation, as the enzymes responsible for hydrolytic deamination of melamine in activated sludge are not easily induced. The insignificant biodegradation of melamine is also attributed to bacterial growth inhibition under long-term dosing conditions with melamine, resulting in a significant decrease in effluent water quality.', 23477409: 'Glycogen-accumulating organisms (GAOs) are thought to compete with polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) in enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) wastewater treatment systems. A laboratory sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated for one year to test the hypothesis that PAOs have a competitive advantage at low acetate concentrations, with a focus on low pH conditions previously shown to favor GAOs. PAOs dominated the system under conventional SBR operation with rapid acetate addition (producing high in-reactor concentrations) and pH values of 7.4-8.4. GAOs dominated when the pH was decreased (6.4-7.0). Decreasing the acetate addition rate led to very low reactor acetate concentrations, and PAOs recovered, supporting the study hypothesis. When the acetate feed rate was increased, EBPR failed again. Dominant PAOs and GAOs were Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis and Defluviicoccus Cluster 2, respectively, according to fluorescent in situ hybridization and 454 pyrosequencing. Surprisingly, GAOs were not the immediate causes of PAO failures, based on functional and population measurements. Pyrosequencing results suggested Dechloromonas and Tetrasphaera spp. may have also been PAOs, and additional potential GAOs were also identified. Full-scale systems typically have lower in-reactor acetate concentrations than laboratory SBRs, and so, previous laboratory studies may have overestimated the practical importance of GAOs as causes of EBPR failure.', 23487302: 'Severe environmental problems arise from old uranium mines, which continue to discharge uranium (U) via acid mine drainage water, resulting in soil, subsoil and groundwater contamination. Bioremediation of U contaminated environments has been attempted, but most of the conceptual models propose U removal by cell suspensions of anaerobic bacteria. In this study, strain Rhodanobacter A2-61, isolated from Urgeiriça Mine, Portugal, was shown to resist up to 2 mM of U(vi). The conditions used (low nutrient content and pH 5) potentiated the interaction of the toxic uranyl ion with the tested strain. The strain was able to remove approximately 120 μM of U(vi) when grown aerobically in the presence of 500 μM U. Under these conditions, this strain was also able to lower the phosphate concentration in the medium and increased its capacity to take up inorganic phosphate, accumulating up to 0.52 μmol phosphate per optical density unit of the medium at 600 nm, after 24 hours, corresponding approximately to the late log phase of the bacterial culture. Microscopically dense intracellular structures with nanometer size were visible. The extent of U inside the cells was quantified by LS counting. EDS analysis of heated cells showed the presence of complexes composed of phosphate and uranium, suggesting the simultaneous precipitation of U and phosphate within the cells. XRD analysis of the cells containing the U-phosphate complexes suggested the presence of a meta-autunite-like mineral structure. SEM identified, in pyrolyzed cells, crystalline nanoparticles with shape in the tetragonal system characteristic of the meta-autunite-like mineral structures. U removal has been reported previously but mainly by cell suspensions and through release of phosphate. The innovative Rhodanobacter A2-61 can actively grow aerobically, in the presence of U, and can efficiently remove U(vi) from the environment, accumulating it in a structural form consistent with that of the mineral meta-autunite inside the cell, corresponding to effective metal immobilization. This work supports previous findings that U bioremediation could be achieved via the biomineralization of U(vi) in phosphate minerals.', 23487989: \"Past use of arsenical pesticides has resulted in elevated levels of arsenic (As) in some Hawaiian soils. Total As concentrations of 20-100 mg/kg are not uncommon, and can exceed 900 mg/kg in some lands formerly planted with sugarcane. With high contents of amorphous aluminosilicates and iron oxides in many Hawaii's volcanic ash-derived Andisols, a high proportion (25-30%) of soil As was associated with either these mineral phases or with organic matter. Less than 1% of the total As was water soluble or exchangeable. Furthermore, the soils can sorb As strongly: the addition of 1000 mg/kg as As (+5) resulted in only between 0.03 and 0.30 mg/L As in soil solution. In contrast, soils having more crystalline minerals (e.g., Oxisols) sorb less As and thus often contain less As. Phosphate fertilization increases As bioaccessibility, whereas the addition of Fe(OH)3 decreases it. Brake fern (Pteris vittata L.) can be used to remove some soil As. Concentrations of As in fronds varied on average from 60 mg/kg when grown on a low-As Oxisol to 350 mg/kg when grown on a high-As Andisol. Ratios of leaf As to CaCl2-extractable soil As were 12 and 222 for the Oxisol and Andisol, respectively.\", 23490107: 'This study investigates the evolution of the microbial community in laboratory-scale soil columns simulating the infiltration zone of managed aquifer recharge (MAR) systems and analogous natural aquifer sediment ecosystems. Parallel systems were supplemented with either moderate (1.1\\xa0mg/L) or low (0.5\\xa0mg/L) biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) for a period of six months during which time, spatial (1\\xa0cm, 30\\xa0cm, 60\\xa0cm, 90\\xa0cm, and 120\\xa0cm) and temporal (monthly) analyses of sediment-associated microbial community structure were analyzed. Total microbial biomass associated with sediments was positively correlated with BDOC concentration where a significant decline in BDOC was observed along the column length. Analysis of 16S rRNA genes indicated dominance by Bacteria with Archaea comprising less than 1 percent of the total community. Proteobacteria was found to be the major phylum in samples from all column depths with contributions from Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria. Microbial community structure at all the phylum, class and genus levels differed significantly at 1\\xa0cm between columns receiving moderate and low BDOC concentrations; in contrast strong similarities were observed both between parallel column systems and across samples from 30 to 120\\xa0cm depths. Samples from 1\\xa0cm depth of the low BDOC columns exhibited higher microbial diversity (expressed as Shannon Index) than those at 1\\xa0cm of moderate BDOC columns, and both increased from 5.4 to 5.9 at 1\\xa0cm depth to 6.7-8.3 at 30-120\\xa0cm depths. The microbial community structure reached steady state after 3-4 months since the initiation of the experiment, which also resulted in an improved DOC removal during the same time period. This study suggested that BDOC could significantly influence microbial community structure regarding both composition and diversity of artificial MAR systems and analogous natural aquifer sediment ecosystems.', 23500046: 'Although high PAH content and detection of PAH-degraders, the PAH biodegradation is limited in aged-contaminated soils due to low PAH availability (i.e., 1%). Here, we tried to experimentally increase the soil PAH availability by keeping both soil properties and contamination composition. Organic extract was first removed and then re-incorporated in the raw soil as fresh contaminants. Though drastic, this procedure only allowed a 6-time increase in the PAH availability suggesting that the organic constituents more than ageing were responsible for low availability. In the re-contaminated soil, the mineralization rate was twice more important, the proportion of 5-6 cycles PAH was higher indicating a preferential degradation of lower molecular weight PAH. The extraction treatment induced bacterial and fungal community structures modifications, Pseudomonas and Fusarium solani species were favoured, and the relative quantity of fungi increased. In re-contaminated soil the percentage of PAH-dioxygenase gene increased, with 10 times more Gram negative representatives.', 23500564: 'The optimization, purification and characterization of bioflocculant produced by Paenibacillus elgii B69 were investigated. The bioflocculant was an exopolysaccharide composed of glucose, glucuronic acid, mannose and xylose. The maximum bioflocculant production was about 25.63 g/L achieved with sucrose at 51.35 g/L, peptone at 6.78 g/L and yeast extract at 0.47 g/L optimized by response-surface methodology. In addition, a series of experiments was performed to investigate the flocculation activities towards kaolin clay, dyeing pigment, heavy metal ion, and real wastewater and the result indicated the new bioflocculant had high activities towards all the tested pollutions. These results showed its great potential for water pretreatment used in industry.', 23500567: 'Marine oil pollution can result in the persistent presence of weathered oil. Currently, removal of weathered oil is reliant on chemical dispersants and physical removal, causing further disruption. In contrast few studies have examined the potential of an environmentally sustainable method using a hydrocarbon degrading microbial community attached to a carrier. Here, we used a tank mesocosm system (50 l) to follow the degradation of weathered oil (10 g l(-1)) using a bacterial consortium mobilised onto different carrier materials (alginate or shell grit). GCMS analysis demonstrated that the extent of hydrocarbon degradation was dependent upon the carrier material. Augmentation of shell grit with nutrients and exogenous hydrocarbon degraders resulted in 75±14% removal of >C32 hydrocarbons after 12 weeks compared to 20±14% for the alginate carrier. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of a biostimulated and bioaugmented carrier material to degrade marine weathered oil.', 23500577: 'In order to achieve advanced nitrogen removal from landfill leachate without the addition of external carbon sources, a novel system coupling an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) and sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was proposed for the treatment of real landfill leachate with NH4+-N and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations of 1100 mg/L and 6000 mg/L, respectively. ASBR could remove 80% of the influent COD under a volumetric loading rate of 5 kg COD/(m3d). Denitritation and simultaneous nitritation-denitritation were responsible for 50% of the TN removal in SBR under alternate anoxic/aerobic modes. Furthermore, advanced nitrogen removal was realized with a total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) removal efficiency of 99% at the expense of endogenous denitritation during a 26 h period, which led to effluent COD and TN values of 550-650 mg/L and 15-25 mgN/L, respectively. For the combined system, removal efficiencies of COD and total nitrogen (TN) were above 90% and 95%, respectively.', 23500581: 'Oxygenation by photosynthesis in a mixed culture of algae and nitrifiers was investigated for its potential to support nitrification. An open photo-bioreactor (1L fermentor; 30°C) was inoculated with an enriched culture of nitrifiers obtained from activated sludge and a pure culture of Scenedesmus sp. The reactor was illuminated (60 μmol/m2 s) and operated as a sequencing batch reactor with 50% discharge per cycle and sludge retention time of 15 or 30 days. Full nitrification of synthetic wastewater (50 mgNH4+-N/L) without mechanical aeration was achieved after less than 14 cycles (18.5 h React per 24h cycle) and the biomass steadily increased until a concentration of 1.9 g VSS/L with 29 mg chl-a/L. The maximum observed nitrification rate was 7.7 mgNH4+-N/Lh. A mass balance showed that ammonium removal was primarily by nitrification (81-85%) rather than by ammonium uptake by algae.', 23533452: 'Atrazine herbicide that is widely used in corn production is frequently detected in water resources. The main objectives of this research were focused on assessing the effects of carbon and nitrogen sources on atrazine biodegradation by mixed bacterial consortium and by evaluating the feasibility of using mixed bacterial consortium in soil culture. Shiraz corn field soil with a long history of atrazine application has been explored for their potential of atrazine biodegradation. The influence of different carbon compounds and the effect of nitrogen sources and a different pH (5.5-8.5) on atrazine removal efficiency by mixed bacterial consortium in liquid culture were investigated. Sodium citrate and sucrose had the highest atrazine biodegradation rate (87.22%) among different carbon sources. Atrazine biodegradation rate decreased more quickly by the addition of urea (26.76%) compared to ammonium nitrate. Based on the data obtained in this study, pH of 7.0 is optimum for atrazine biodegradation. After 30 days of incubation, the percent of atrazine reduction rates were significantly enhanced in the inoculated soils (60.5%) as compared to uninoculated control soils (12%) at the soil moisture content of 25%. In conclusion, bioaugmentation of soil with mixed bacterial consortium may enhance the rate of atrazine degradation in a highly polluted soil.', 23536219: 'A polyurethane (PU) degrading bacterial strain MZA-75 was isolated from soil through enrichment technique. The bacterium was identified through 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the phylogenetic analysis indicated the strain MZA-75 belonged to genus Bacillus having maximum similarity with Bacillus subtilis strain JBE0016. The degradation of PU films by strain MZA-75 in mineral salt medium (MSM) was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). SEM revealed the appearance of widespread cracks on the surface. FTIR spectrum showed decrease in ester functional group. Increase in polydispersity index was observed in GPC, which indicates chain scission as a result of microbial treatment. CO2 evolution and cell growth increased when PU was used as carbon source in MSM in Sturm test. Increase in both cell associated and extracellular esterases was observed in the presence of PU indicated by p-Nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) hydrolysis assay. Analysis of cell free supernatant by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed that 1,4-butanediol and adipic acid monomers were produced. Bacillus subtilis strain MZA-75 can degrade the soft segment of polyester polyurethane, unfortunately no information about the fate of hard segment could be obtained. Growth of strain MZA-75 in the presence of these metabolites indicated mineralization of ester hydrolysis products into CO2 and H2O.

The presence of cadmium reduced growth, and a longer lag phase was observed. However, the phosphate uptake from the culture medium increased 15% when compared to the control. Moreover, C. elegans removed 70%-81% of the cadmium added to the culture medium during its growth. The C. elegans mycelia showed a removal efficiency of 280 mg/g at a cadmium concentration of 22.10 mg/L, and the removal velocity of cadmium was 0.107 mg/h. Additionally, it was observed that cadmium induced vacuolization, the presence of electron dense deposits in vacuoles, cytoplasm and cell membranes, as well as the distinct behavior of polyphosphate fractions. The results obtained with C. elegans suggest that precipitation, vacuolization and polyphosphate fractions were associated to cadmium tolerance, and this species demonstrated a higher potential for bioremediation of heavy metals.', 23549926: 'In the present study, the influence of kaolinite and goethite on microbial degradation of methyl parathion was investigated. We observed that the biodegradation process was improved by kaolinite and depressed by goethite. Calorimetric data further showed that the metabolic activities of degrading cells (Pseudomonas putida) were enhanced by the presence of kaolinite and depressed by the presence of goethite. A semipermeable membrane experiment was performed and results supported the above observations: the promotive effect of kaolinite and the inhibition of goethite for microbial degradation was not found when the bacteria was enclosed by semipermeable membrane and had no direct contact with these minerals, suggesting the important function of the contact of cellular surfaces with mineral particles. The relative larger particles of kaolinite were loosely attached to the bacteria. This attachment made the cells easy to use the sorbed substrate and then stimulated biodegradation. For goethite, small particles were tightly bound to bacterial cells and limited the acquisition of substrate and nutrients, thereby inhibiting biodegradation. These results indicated that interfacial interaction between bacterial cells and minerals significantly affected the biodegradation of pesticides.

The experiments involved an anaerobic sequencing batch reactor fed with a synthetic substrate mixture including glucose, starch and volatile fatty acids, and operated in a sequence of different phases with gradually increasing tetracycline doses of 1.65-8.5 mg/L, for more than five months. Tetracycline exerted a terminal/lethal effect at 8.5 mg/L on the microbial community under anaerobic conditions, which caused the inhibition of substrate/COD utilization and biogas generation and leading to a total collapse of the reactor. The microbial activity could not be recovered and re-started within a period of more than 10 days, even after stopping tetracycline dosing. At lower doses, substrate utilization was not affected but a reduction of 10-20% was observed in the biogas/methane generation, suggesting that substrate utilization of tetracycline to the biomass was limiting their bioavailability. During the experiments, tetracycline was partially removed either through biodegradation or conversion into its by-products. The adverse long-term impact was quite variable for fermenting heterotrophic and methanogenic fractions of the microbial community based on changes inflicted on the composition of remaining/residual organic substrate.', 23561501: 'Ionic liquids (ILs) have attracted great interest in academia and industry during the last decade. So far, several ILs have been used in technological processes, from small scale to industrial applications, which makes it more and more likely that they will be released into the environment. Researchers have been actively studying the environmental and toxicological behaviour of ILs, but their influence on the activated sludge communities of wastewater treatment plants have yet to be investigated. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by systematically investigating the influence of ILs on activated sewage sludge communities. We tested the inhibition of activated sludge respiration (according to OECD guideline 209) by a selection of 19 different compounds covering the chemical space of ILs as comprehensively as possible. To elicit the differences in sensitivities/tolerances towards ILs we investigated activated sludge from different domestic and industrial sources. Generally speaking, the structure activity relationships of IL toxicity towards activated sludge are in good agreement with those found for other organisms and test systems. The inhibitory potential of tested ILs substituted with short alkyl chains (≤ 4) and polar anions was low. On the other hand, the toxic effects of highly hydrophobic ionic cations and anions were greater - IC50 values were low, some < 50 μM (<10 mg L(-1)). We were able to demonstrate that the EC50 values from Vibrio fischeri can be used for a reliable assessment of the sludge inhibition potential of tested ILs. All the results are discussed in the context of their consequences for biodegradation processes and the performance of wastewater treatment plants.', 23563440: 'The aim of the present research work was to boost biogas production from cattle manure (CM) by adding food waste (FW) and crude glycerin (Gly) from the biodiesel industry as co-substrates. For this purpose, different quantities of FW and Gly were added to CM and co-digested in an induced bed reactor (IBR) at 55 °C. Sonication pre-treatment was implemented in the CM+Gly mixture, applying 550 kJ/kg TS to enhance the biodegradability of these co-substrates. The best results were obtained with mixtures of 87/10/3 (CM/FW/Gly) (w/w) operating at an organic loading rate of 7 g COD/L day, obtaining 92% COD removal, a specific methane yield of 640 L CH4/kg VS and a methane production rate of 2.6L CH4/L day. These results doubled those obtained in the co-digestion of CM and FW without the addition of Gly (330 L CH4/kg VS and 1.2L CH4/L day).', 23566468: 'The ionic liquids, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [BMIM][PF6], N-ethylpyridiniumtrifluoroacetate [EtPy][CF3COO] and N-ethylpyridiniumtetrafluoroborate [EtPy][BF4], affected the reduction and precipitation of uranium by Clostridium sp. to a varying degree. Characterization of uranium association with the ionic liquids showed that uranium formed a monodentate complex with the anion BF4(-) and PF6(-) of [EtPy][BF4] and [BMIM][PF6], respectively; and a bidentate complex with carboxylate of [EtPy][CF3COO]. Bioreduction of U(VI) was influenced by the type of complex formed: monodentate complexes were readily reduced whereas the bidentate complex of U(VI) with [CF3COO] was recalcitrant. [EtPy][BF4] affected the rate and extent of precipitation of the reduced uranium; at higher concentration the reduced U(IV) remained in the solution phase. The results suggest that by tuning the properties of ionic liquids they may be valuable candidates for uranium biotreatment.', 23567171: 'The effects of elevated CO2 on the metal bioavailability and the rhizosphere characteristics of hyperaccumulator are not well understood. In this study, soil pot experiment was carried out to contrast the effects of elevated CO2 on rhizosphere characteristics between a hyperaccumulating ecotype (HE) and a non-hyperaccumulating ecotype (NHE) of Sedum alfredii grown under ambient (350 μL L(-1)) or elevated (800 μL L(-1)) CO2. Elevated CO2 facilitated the growth of both ecotypes of S. alfredii, but the promotion in the HE was much greater than in the NHE. No significant (P<0.05) changes in soil pH, dissolved organic matter (DOM) and microbial biomass (Cmic) were observed in the rhizosphere of NHE under both CO2 level. For HE, however, elevated CO2 reduced soil pH by 0.3 units, increased DOM (especially for hydrophilic acid (HiA) fractions) by 19.2% and Cmic by 19%, as compared to ambient CO2. Mobile Cd and Zn (extractable with 1M NH4NO3) in the rhizosphere of HE decreased considerably, but the decreases were greater under ambient CO2 than under elevated CO2. Phytoextraction efficiency of Cd and Zn by HE was increased significantly by elevated CO2 (P<0.05). The results suggest that elevated CO2 can change soil microenvironment, increase bioavailability of Cd and Zn and thus facilitate metal uptake by the HE. This work highlights that elevated CO2 may be a useful way to improve phytoremediation efficiency of Cd/Zn-contaminated soil by hyperaccumulating ecotype S. alfredii.', 23567668: 'Biochars produced from biomass residues have been recognized as effective sorbents to hydrophobic compounds, but knowledge on sorption of antibiotics to biochar and its mechanisms are still inadequate. Sorption of oxytetracycline (OTC) in aqueous solution to maize-straw-derived biochar, and the effect of pH and metal ions, was investigated in batch experiments, and the main sorption mechanisms were elucidated using FTIR and zeta potential measurements. The results showed that sorption of OTC on biochar was highly pH-dependant. The amount of sorbed OTC first increased and then decreased with increasing pH, and maximum sorption was achieved at pH 5.5. Cu(2+) enhanced the sorption of OTC, while Pb(2+) slightly reduced the sorption under acidic conditions. Other metal ions had no significant effect on the sorption of OTC to biochar. Surface complexation, through π-π interaction and metal bridging, was the most important sorption mechanism although cation exchange might have played a role.', 23567674: 'Wastewaters from the soft drinks industry were examined as media for producing bioethanol using yeast-mediated fermentation. Fermentation assays were performed using cola-type, orange and lemon-lime soft drinks and the biomass, sugar and ethanol levels were monitored over time. The effect of the addition of yeast extract was evaluated; the results indicated that 15 g/L is a suitable value for successful fermentation. Depletion of the sugars contained in the soft drinks (10-12% w/v) was achieved in less than 12 h when the medium was inoculated with 2 g/L of Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. Windsor. Ethanol yields were close to the theoretical values. The performance of several kinetic models was evaluated, and their parameters were determined. A model including inhibition by ethanol enabled the best adjustment of the experimental results in all assayed media. Some soft drinks include sodium benzoate in their formulae, the effect of which on yeast metabolism is discussed.', 23567679: 'This study investigated the anaerobic decolorization of the dye mixture containing methyl orange (MO) and naphthol green B (NGB) by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. S. oneidensis MR-1 showed a strong ability to decolorize the dye mixture. MO was easier to get the electrons and inhibited the reduction of NGB, despite of its lower redox potential than NGB. The Mtr respiratory pathway played an important role in this process. Meantime, addition of extracellular electron shuttles accelerated the decolorization. Those results suggest that the decolorization capacity of S. oneidensis MR-1 is associated with the electricity production. The operating parameters, such as electron acceptors, temperature, and pH, were also investigated in this study. Thus, this work may facilitate a better understanding of the extensive nonspecific reduction capacity of exoelectrogens and is beneficial for promoting their application in bioremediation.', 23567691: 'Microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) devices are efficient for wastewater treatment, but its application was limited due to low anode oxidation rate. The objective of this study was to improve anode performance of a MEC combined anaerobic reactor (R1) for high concentration industrial wastewater treatment via dosing Fe(OH)3. For the first 53 days without power, the addition of Fe(OH)3 in R1 enhanced the degradation of reactive brilliant red X-3B dye and sucrose. Applying a voltage of 0.8 V in R1 resulted in a higher decolorization and COD removal through driving the redox reactions at electrodes under Fe(III)-reducing conditions. Real-time PCR and enzyme activity analysis showed that the abundance and azoreductase activity of bacteria were improved in R1. Pyrosequencing revealed that dominant populations in anode biofilm and R1 were more diverse and abundant than the common anaerobic reactor (R2), and there was a significant distinction among anode film, R1 and R2 in microbial community structure.', 23567737: 'A concentration-dependent increase in activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione, superoxide dismutase) and carotenoid, MDA level have been observed in the green alga Chlorella vulgaris following chromium exposure at different concentrations (0.01-100 μg ml(-1)). Simultaneously, decrease in growth rate, chlorophyll and protein contents was observed. In case of ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase a bell shaped dose response was evident, however, lipid peroxidation followed a linear relationship along with catalase activity, which could be used as biomarker of Cr toxicity and played important role in providing tolerance and subsequently, high accumulation potential of chromium in C. vulgaris. In present investigation, the green alga C. vulgaris respond better under chromium stress in terms of tolerance, growth and metal accumulating potential at higher concentration of Cr (VI) which could be employed in decontamination of chromium for environmental cleanup.', 23579003: 'This paper describes a modelling study where five new benchmark plant design configurations for biological nutrient removal (A(2)/O, UCT, JHB, MUCT and BDP-5 stage) are simulated and evaluated under different model assumptions.

The second case (A2) adds nitrite as a new state variable, describing nitrification and denitrification as two-step processes. The third set of models (A3 and A4) considers different reactive settlers types (diffusion-limited/non limited). This study analyses the importance of these new model extensions to correctly describe the nitrification behaviour and the carbon source competition between ordinary heterotrophic organisms (OHO) and polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAO) under certain operation conditions.

A high sulfate-to-COD ratio (>1.25 mg SO4/mg COD) in the saline sewage resulting from this practice has enabled us to develop the Sulfate reduction Autotrophic denitrification and Nitrification Integrated (SANI(®)) process with minimal sludge production. This study seeks to expand the SANI process into an enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process. A sulfur cycle associated EBPR was explored in an alternating anaerobic/oxygen-limited aerobic sequencing batch reactor with acetate fed as sole electron donor and sulfate as sulfur source at a total organic carbon to sulfur ratio of 1.1-3.1 (mg C/mg S). Phosphate uptake and polyphosphate formation was observed in this reactor that sustained high phosphate removal (20 mg P/L removed with 320 mg COD/L). This new EBPR process was supported by six observations: 1) anaerobic phosphate release associated with acetate uptake, poly-phosphate hydrolysis, poly-hydroxyalkanoate (PHA) (and poly-S(2-)/S(0)) formation and an \"aerobic\" phosphate uptake associated with PHA (and poly-S(2-)/S(0)) degradation, and polyphosphate formation; 2) a high P/VSS ratio (>0.16 mg P/mg VSS) and an associated low VSS/TSS ratio (0.75) characteristic of conventional PAOs; 3) a lack of P-release and P-uptake with formaldehyde inactivation and autoclaved sterilized biomass; 4) an absence of chemical precipitated P crystals as determined by XRD analysis; 5) a sludge P of more than 90% polyphosphate as determined by sequential P extraction; and 6) microscopically, observed PHA, poly-P and S globules in the biomass.', 23612168: 'Microbial fuel cells have gained popularity in recent years due to its promise in converting organic wastewater into renewable electrical energy. In this study, a membrane-less MFC with a biocathode was developed to evaluate its performance in electricity generation while simultaneously treating wastewater. The MFC fed with a continuous flow of 2g/day acetate produced a power density of 30 mW/m(2) and current density of 245 mA/m(2). A substrate degradation efficiency (SDE) of 75.9% was achieved with 48.7% attributed to the anaerobic process and 27.2% to the aerobic process. Sequencing analysis of the microbial consortia using 16S rDNA pryosequencing showed the predominance of Bacteroidia in the anode after one month of operation, while the microbial community in the cathode chamber was dominated by Gamma-proteobacteria and Beta-proteobacteria. Coulombic efficiencies varied from 19.8% to 58.1% using different acetate concentrations, indicating power density can be further improved through the accumulation of electron-transferring bacteria.', 23612174: 'In the present study composting of water hyacinth was done with cattle manure and saw dust (6:3:1) ratio and effects of addition of lime (1%, 2% and 3%) on heavy metal bioavailability and leachability was evaluated during 30 days of composting period. The changes in temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter and extractable heavy metal contents were measured. Results showed that the total concentration of heavy metals was increased during the composting process. Due to addition of lime initial pH of the compost was raised effectively, caused a decrease in water soluble, diethylene triamine pentracetic acid (DTPA) and toxicity characteristics leaching procedure (TCLP) extractable metal contents in the final compost. Water soluble metals (Ni, Pb and Cd) and DTPA extractable metals (Pb and Cd) were not detected during water soluble fraction. Addition of lime significantly reduced the bioavailability and leachability of heavy metals during water hyacinth composting process.', 23612179: 'Swede rape straw (Brassica napus L.) was modified by oxalic acid under mild conditions producing an efficient dye adsorbent (SRSOA). This low-cost and environmental friendly bioadsorbent was characterized by various techniques and then applied to purify dye-contaminated aqueous solutions. Equilibrium study showed that the Langmuir model demonstrated the best fit to the equilibrium data and the methylene blue (MB) adsorption capacity calculated by this model was 432mgg(-1). The adsorption process and mechanism is also discussed. To properly deal with the dye-loaded bioadsorbents, the disposal methodology is discussed and a biochar based on depleted bioadsorbents was for the first time produced and examined. This method both solved the disposal problem of contaminant-loaded bioadsorbents and produced an useful adsorbent thereafter. The study indicates that SRSOA is a promising substitute for ACs in purifying dye-contaminated wastewater and that producing biochars from contaminant-loaded bioadsorbents maybe a feasible disposal method.', 23614030: '2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (2-C-4-NA) is used as an intermediate in the manufacture of dyes, pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitor and also used in the synthesis of niclosamide, a molluscicide. It is marked as a black-listed substance due to its poor biodegradability. We report biodegradation of 2-C-4-NA and its pathway characterization by Rhodococcus sp. strain MB-P1 under aerobic conditions. The strain MB-P1 utilizes 2-C-4-NA as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. In the growth medium, the degradation of 2-C-4-NA occurs with the release of nitrite ions, chloride ions, and ammonia. During the resting cell studies, the 2-C-4-NA-induced cells of strain MB-P1 transformed 2-C-4-NA stoichiometrically to 4-amino-3-chlorophenol (4-A-3-CP), which subsequently gets transformed to 6-chlorohydroxyquinol (6-CHQ) metabolite. Enzyme assays by cell-free lysates prepared from 2-C-4-NA-induced MB-P1 cells, demonstrated that the first enzyme in the 2-C-4-NA degradation pathway is a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes the stoichiometric removal of nitro group and production of 4-A-3-CP. Oxygen uptake studies on 4-A-3-CP and related anilines by 2-C-4-NA-induced MB-P1 cells demonstrated the involvement of aniline dioxygenase in the second step of 2-C-4-NA degradation. This is the first report showing 2-C-4-NA degradation and elucidation of corresponding metabolic pathway by an aerobic bacterium.', 23619139: 'The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of biochar for removing Cd from aqueous solution. Biochars were produced from a Miscanthus sacchariflorus via slow pyrolysis at 300, 400, 500 and 600°C. Higher pyrolytic temperature resulted in biochar with a higher aromatic structure and fewer polar functional groups. In particular, pH and surface area of biochar increased greatly at pyrolytic temperatures ≥ 500°C, which increased Cd sorption capacity up to 13.24 mgg(-1). The diffuse-controlled Cd removal was likely due to a surface sorption or a precipitation reaction depending on pH. A simulation with the visual MINTEQ program indicated that the precipitate was Cd(OH)2. In addition, biochar treatment significantly removed the acute toxicity of Cd toward Daphnia magna, resulting in increase of EC50 (50% effective concentration) value from 0.16 to 0.76 mgL(-1).', 23621010: 'The isoflavone genistein (GEN) is a natural product with potential applications for skin cancer treatment and chemoprevention; however its high lipophilicity and chemical instability limits its clinical use. Therefore, attempts towards protecting GEN against degradation and increasing its penetration in the skin might be a valid approach. In this work, GEN loaded-PLA nanocapsules (GEN-NC) were prepared by interfacial deposition of preformed polymer (nanoprecipitation); physicochemical characterization and stability studies for 90 days were conducted. GEN-NC were incorporated into semi-solid formulations and permeation experiments were carried out using porcine ear skin. GEN-NC optimized formulation presented a mean diameter of 139 +/- 7.31 nm, polydispersity index of 0.128 +/- 0.08, encapsulation efficiency of 89.63 +/- 2.27% and drug loading from 0.6 to 1.4 w/w%. Stability studies demonstrated that nanocapsules did not exhibit aggregation during the 90 days of the assay, however, a drop in encapsulation efficiency was observed in the first 10 days. Permeation experiments demonstrated that a higher amount of GEN reaches deeper layers of the skin and increased penetration was achieved when GEN-NC were incorporated in a semi-solid gel formulation, indicating that GEN-NC might be a promising nanocarrier system for skin delivery of GEN.', 23623431: 'The main objective of this study was to investigate the performance of a cyclic rotating-bed biological reactor (CRBR) in comparison to a sequencing continuous-inflow reactor (SCR) for the biodegradation and mineralization of catechol. Results showed that catechol degradation and mineralization in the SCR at the organic loading of 7.82kgCOD/m(3)d and the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 9h were 28.2% and 10.3%, respectively. Under similar operating conditions to SCR, steady-state performance of CRBR with polyurethane foam (PUF) media for degradation and mineralization of catechol achieved was 98.7% and 97.9%, respectively. In comparison, the CRBR with 2H media attained average steady-state catechol degradation and mineralization of 89.1% and 83.6%, respectively, under similar conditions. Accordingly, the CRBR with PUF media presents a promising process for efficiently treating wastewater containing high concentrations of toxic, inhibitory and resistant compounds at a relatively short HRT.', 23624048: 'The aim of this work was to investigate the decolorization and degradation of azo dyes by growing cells of a new yeast strain TL-F1 which was isolated from the sea mud. Strain TL-F1 was identified as Candida tropicalis on the basis of 28S rDNA analysis. Various azo dyes (20mg/L) were efficiently decolorized through aerobic degradation. Meantime, the effects of different parameters on both decolorization of Acid Brilliant Scarlet GR and growth of strain TL-F1 were investigated. Furthermore, possible degradation pathway of the dye GR was proposed through analysis of metabolic products using UV-Vis spectroscopy and HPLC-MS methods. As far as it is known, it is the first systematic research on a C. tropicalis strain which is capable of efficiently decolorizing various azo dyes under aerobic condition.

The resulting nanocomposites have been structurally and thermally characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), wide/small angle X-ray diffraction (WAXS/SAXS, respectively) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). TEM evaluation provides evidence of an excellent nanometric dispersion of the oxide component in the polymeric matrix, with aggregates having an average size well below 100 nm. Presence of these TiO2 nanoparticles induces a nucleant effect during polymer crystallization. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of nanocomposites has been tested using both UV and visible light against Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The bactericidal behavior has been explained through the analysis of the material optical properties, with a key role played by the creation of new electronic states within the polymer-based nanocomposites.', 23644074: \"A novel entrapment matrix, calcium alginate (CA) coupled with activated carbon fiber (ACF), was prepared to immobilize Pseudomonas oleovorans DT4 for degrading tetrahydrofuran (THF). The addition of 1.5% ACF increased the adsorption capacity of the immobilized bead, thus resulting in an enhanced average removal rate of 30.3mg/(Lh). The synergism between adsorption and biodegradation was observed in the hybrid CA-ACF beads instead of in the system comprising CA beads and freely suspended ACF. The effective diffusion coefficient of the CA-ACF bead was not significantly affected by bead size, but the bead's value of 1.14×10(-6)cm(2)/s (for the bead diameter of 0.4 cm) was larger than that of the CA bead by almost one order of magnitude based on the intraparticle diffusion-reaction kinetics analysis. Continuous treatment of the THF-containing wastewater was succeeded by CA-ACF immobilized cells in a packed-bed reactor for 54 d with a >90% removal efficiency.\", 23647119: 'This study examined the interrelation between the biodegradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) by Ceriporia sp. ZLY-2010 and its fungal enzyme systems. The degradation rates of Aroclor 1254 and 1260 were 29.01% on day 5 and 36.80% on day 10, respectively. MnP (Manganese dependent peroxidase) and laccase activities showed the greatest increases in the samples containing Aroclors, indicating that extracellular enzymes of Ceriporia sp. ZLY-2010 were affected by the addition of Aroclors. However, the relationship between the biodegradation rate and extracellular enzymes might be obscured by the complexity of the biodegradation process. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase was inhibited and the biodegradation rate of the Aroclor decreased by adding the inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed that intracellular enzymes play a significant role in the biodegradation of Aroclor. Complex extracellular and intracellular enzyme systems in Ceriporia sp. ZLY-2010 play an important role in degrading PCBs. Physiological changes of Ceriporia sp. ZLY-2010 caused by PCBs appeared to affect biodegradation of PCBs. However, it is necessary to further study the unidentified enzymes related to the biodegradation of Aroclor.', 23648761: 'In this study, a two-stage system converting organic solid waste (food waste+sewage sludge) to H2 and CH4 was operated. In the first stage of dark fermentative hydrogen production (DFHP), a recently proposed method that does not require external inoculum, was applied. In the second stage, anaerobic sequencing batch reactor (ASBR) and an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor (UASBr) were followed to treat H2 fermenter effluent. (H2+CH4-ASBR) system showed better performance in terms of total biogas conversion (78.6%), while higher biogas production rate (2.03 L H2/Lsystem/d, 1.96 L CH4/Lsystem/d) was achieved in (H2+CH4-UASBr) system. To reduce the alkali addition requirement in DFHP process, CH4 fermenter effluent was tested as a diluting water. Both the ASBR and UASBr effluent was effective to keep the pH above 6 without CH4 production. In case of using ASBR effluent, H2 production dropped by 15%, but alkali addition requirement was reduced by 50%.', 23648764: 'Biofixation of CO2 by microalgae has been recognized as an attractive approach to CO2 mitigation. The main objective of this work was to maximize the rate of CO2 fixation ( [Formula: see text] ) by the green microalga Chlorella vulgaris P12 cultivated photoautotrophically in bubble column photobioreactors under different CO2 concentrations (ranging from 2% to 10%) and aeration rates (ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 vvm). Results showed that the maximum [Formula: see text] (2.22 gL(-1)d(-1)) was obtained by using 6.5% CO2 and 0.5 vvm after 7 days of cultivation at 30°C. Although final biomass concentration and maximum biomass productivity of microalgae were affected by the different cultivation conditions, no significant differences were obtained in the biochemical composition of microalgal cells for the evaluated levels of aeration and CO2. The present study demonstrated that optimization of microalgal cultivation conditions can be considered a useful strategy for maximizing CO2 bio-mitigation by C. vulgaris.', 23660752: 'The potential impact of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) on nitrogen removal from wastewater in activated sludge was investigated using a sequencing batch reactor.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles showed that 200\\xa0mg\\xa0L(-1) of TiO2 NPs significantly reduced microbial diversity in the activated sludge. The effect of light on the antibacterial activity of TiO2 NPs was also investigated, and the results showed that the levels of TiO2-dependent inhibition of biological nitrogen removal were similar under both dark and light conditions. Additional studies revealed that different TiO2 concentrations had a significant effect on dehydrogenase activity, and this effect was most likely the result of decreased microbial activity.

The microbial flocculants (MBF) produced by TG-1, named as MBF-TG-1, was applied to defecating the strong basic trona suspension in the trona industry. After optimizing medium and culturing conditions with single-factor and orthogonal designs, the highest flocculation rate of 86.9% was achieved. Chemical analysis showed that the purified microbial flocculants (MBF-TG-1) was mainly composed of polysaccharides (84.6%), with a small amount of protein or amino acid (11.1%). Bridging mechanism was supposed as the main flocculation mechanism by analyzing the flocculation process and the biochemistry properties of MBF-TG-1.

However, the formation and structural stability of aerobic granular sludge is susceptible to toxic shock. In the study, the effect of 4-chloroaniline (4-ClA) as a common toxic pollutant on the granular structure and performance was investigated, and the mechanism was revealed to provide more information on 4-ClA degradation with aerobic granular sludge process. The results showed that a 4-ClA shock at influent 200 mg L(-1) could cause the disintegration of aerobic granular sludge and decrease of the pollutant removal performance. The analysis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) within the mature and disintegrated granular sludge showed that the decrease of protein content in EPS, especially the components like Amide I 3-turn helix and β-sheet structures and aspartate, was not good for the stability of aerobic granular sludge. The microbial community results demonstrated that the disappearance of dominant bacteria like Kineosphaera limosa or appearance like Acinetobacter, might contribute to the reduction of EPS and disintegration of aerobic granular sludge.', 23691515: 'The capability of a cell bound biosurfactant produced by Lactobacillus pentosus, to accelerate the bioremediation of a hydrocarbon-contaminated soil, was compared with a synthetic anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate SDS-). The biosurfactant produced by the bacteria was analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) that clearly indicates the presence of OH and NH groups, C=O stretching of carbonyl groups and NH nebding (peptide linkage), as well as CH2-CH3 and C-O stretching, with similar FTIR spectra than other biosurfactants obtained from lactic acid bacteria. After the characterization of biosurfactant by FTIR, soil contaminated with 7,000 mg Kg(-1) of octane was treated with biosurfactant from L. pentosus or SDS. Treatment of soil for 15 days with the biosurfactant produced by L. pentosus led to a 65.1% reduction in the hydrocarbon concentration, whereas SDS reduced the octane concentration to 37.2% compared with a 2.2% reduction in the soil contaminated with octane in absence of biosurfactant used as control. Besides, after 30 days of incubation soil with SDS or biosurfactant gave percentages of bioremediation around 90% in both cases. Thus, it can be concluded that biosurfactant produced by L. pentosus accelerates the bioremediation of octane-contaminated soil by improving the solubilisation of octane in the water phase of soil, achieving even better results than those reached with SDS after 15-day treatment.', 23706893: 'Market-grade DDT used for mosquito control and other purposes is a mixture of 4,4-DDT, 2,4-DDT and smaller amounts of 4,4-DDD, 2,4-DDD, 4,4-DDE and 4,4-DDMU. All above components (together known as DDTr) are strongly hydrophobic and hence are present in the environment predominantly in the soil/sediment phases. The persistence of DDTr and the feasibility of attenuation of DDTr concentration in soil matrix through addition of amendments is a subject of ongoing interest. The objective of this study was to compare the decline of soil-partitioned DDTr concentration through, (1) the natural attenuation process, (2) enhanced aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation processes involving addition of acclimatized seed and co-metabolites and (3) Nanoscale Zero Valent Iron (NZVI) addition. The extent of decline in soil DDTr concentration in control experiments, where biodegradation and photolysis were excluded, was around 10-15% in ∼100d. Extent of DDTr decline in natural attenuation experiments was 25-30% and 15-20% under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively. In enhanced biodegradation experiments, addition of acclimatized seed and/or co-metabolites did not enhance the extent of DDTr attenuation over and above the natural attenuation rates both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It thus appeared that biodegradation of DDTr adsorbed on soil was severely limited and controlled by desorption and consequent bioavailability of DDTr in the aqueous phase. In case of NZVI addition, the rate of DDTr degradation was much faster, with 40% decrease in DDTr concentration within 28h of NZVI addition. Here, the faster DDTr degradation may be through direct electron transfer between NZVI particles and DDTr molecules adsorbed on soil. Increase in the concentration of 4,4-DDD and 2,4-DDD during NZVI addition suggest that these compounds are either intermediate or end products of DDT degradation process.

Three strategies of temperature-shift procedure, two-stage DO control and fed-batch process were used to change growth rate. And a 62.2% improvement of keratinase yield was achieved. With the glucose fed-batch procedure in 30-L fermenter, keratinase production was significantly improved up to 117.7% (1728 U/ml) as compared with initial data (793.8 U/ml) in a 3-L fermenter and with much shortened fermentation time within 18 h. Significant structure changes and high levels of free amino acids from wool decomposition indicated the possible applications for wool waste management and fertilizer industry. The remarkable digestion of wool cuticle also suggested its potential utilization in textile industry.', 23764600: 'Water and wastewater filtration systems often house pathogenic bacteria, which must be removed to ensure clean, safe water. Here, we determine the persistence of the model bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in two types of filtration systems, and use P. aeruginosa bacteriophages to determine their ability to selectively remove P. aeruginosa. These systems used beds of either anthracite or granular activated carbon (GAC), which were operated at an empty bed contact time (EBCT) of 45 min. The clean bed filtration systems were loaded with an instantaneous dose of P. aeruginosa at a total cell number of 2.3 (± 0.1 [standard deviation]) × 10(7) cells. An immediate dose of P. aeruginosa phages (1 mL of phage stock at the concentration of 2.7 × 10(7) PFU (Plaque Forming Units)/mL) resulted in a reduction of 50% (± 9%) and >99.9% in the effluent P. aeruginosa concentrations in the clean anthracite and GAC filters, respectively. To further evaluate the effects of P. aeruginosa phages, synthetic stormwater was run through anthracite and GAC biofilters where mixed-culture biofilms were present. Eighty five days after an instantaneous dose of P. aeruginosa (2.3 × 10(7) cells per filter) on day 1, 7.5 (± 2.8) × 10(7) and 1.1 (± 0.5) × 10(7) P. aeruginosa cells/g filter media were detected in the top layer (close to the influent port) of the anthracite and GAC biofilters, respectively, demonstrating the growth and persistence of pathogenic bacteria in the biofilters. A subsequent 1-h dose of phages, at the concentration of 5.1 × 10(6) PFU/mL and flow rate of 1.6 mL/min, removed the P. aeruginosa inside the GAC biofilters and the anthracite biofilters by 70% (± 5%) and 56% (± 1%), respectively, with no P. aeruginosa detected in the effluent, while not affecting ammonia oxidation or the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community inside the biofilters. These results suggest that phage treatment can selectively remove pathogenic bacteria with minimal impact on beneficial organisms from attached growth systems for effluent quality improvement.', 23764610: 'Recent studies have suggested that the ability of a surfactant to enhance the bioavailability of hydrophobic organic compounds (HOC) requires the formation of surfactant hemi-micelles on the bacterial cell surface and subsequent partitioning of HOC into the hemi-micelles. However, the studies did not provide direct evidence of HOC partitioning into surfactant hemi-micelles on the bacterial cell surface. In this study, direct evidence is provided to demonstrate that the nonionic surfactant Brij 30 forms hemi-micelles on the bacterial cell surface and that phenanthrene sorption at the bacterial surface is enhanced by the surfactant. These results are in agreement with the current theory describing surfactant-enhanced HOC bioavailability. This enhanced bioavailability is put into context with microbial kinetics and system partitioning processes, and it is demonstrated that the addition of surfactant can enhance, have no effect, or inhibit HOC biodegradation depending upon surfactant concentration and microbial growth rate. Understanding these non-linear relationships between surfactant-enhanced HOC bioavailability, biodegradation kinetics, and system partitioning will assist in the design and implementation of surfactant-enhanced bioremediation programs.

At the onset of nitrification, both nitrifying bacteria and their products exert a monochloramine demand, decreasing the residual disinfectant concentration in water distribution systems. This work investigated another potentially significant mechanism for residual disinfectant loss: monochloramine cometabolism by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Monochloramine cometabolism was studied with the pure culture AOB Nitrosomonas europaea (ATCC 19718) in batch kinetic experiments under drinking water conditions. Three batch reactors were used in each experiment: a positive control to estimate the ammonia kinetic parameters, a negative control to account for abiotic reactions, and a cometabolism reactor to estimate the cometabolism kinetic constants. Kinetic parameters were estimated in AQUASIM with a simultaneous fit to all experimental data. The cometabolism reactors showed a more rapid monochloramine decay than in the negative controls, demonstrating that cometabolism occurs. Cometabolism kinetics were best described by a pseudo first order model with a reductant term to account for ammonia availability. Monochloramine cometabolism kinetics were similar to those of ammonia metabolism, and monochloramine cometabolism was a significant loss mechanism (30-60% of the observed monochloramine decay). These results suggest that monochloramine cometabolism should occur in practice and may be a significant contribution to monochloramine decay during nitrification episodes in drinking water distribution systems.

Its polyphenols content is a hindrance to conventional biological treatment and to using it as growing medium for common microbial biomasses. The practice to dump it on soil is in conflict with the latest EU directives about waste management. OMWW can be effectively and efficiently treated by means of membrane technology to a fraction of the initial volume, but membrane processing concentrates still require treatment. Reversing the overall cost balance of membrane processing and subsequent treatment requires valorizing the concentrates through their reuse, as well as ensuring long-term service of the membrane system through effective wastewater pretreatment and sustainable, fouling-controlling, membrane operation conduite. Aim of this work is to reuse and valorize the ultra- and nanofiltration membrane concentrates as media for biomass production of microalgae and cyanobacteria. Scenedesmus dimorphus and Arthrospira platensis, usable as a food, feed, nutraceutical component or feedstock for biofuels, were selected for this investigation.

We evaluated the effects of phosphate addition on plant biomass and on arsenate and phosphate uptake by Anadenanthera peregrina, an important Brazilian savanna legume. Plants were grown for 35 days in substrates that received combinations of 0, 10, 50, and 100 mg kg(-1) arsenate and 0, 200, and 400 mg kg(-1) phosphate. The addition of P increased the arsenic-phytoremediation capacity of A. peregrina by increasing As accumulation, while also alleviating As-induced oxidative stress. Arsenate phytotoxicity in A. peregrina is due to lipid peroxidation, but not hydrogen peroxide accumulation. Added P also increased the activity of important reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzymes (catalase and ascorbate peroxidase) that help prevent lipid peroxidation in leaves. Our findings suggest that applying P represents a feasible strategy for more efficient As phytoremediation using A. peregrina.', 23830692: 'Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) has relatively high resistance to aluminum (Al) toxicity than the various herbaceous plants and model plant species. To investigate Al-tolerance mechanism, the metabolism of organic acids and the chemical forms of Al in the target site (root tips) in Eucalyptus was investigated. To do this, 2-year old rooted cuttings of E. camaldulensis were cultivated in half-strength Hoagland solution (pH 4.0) containing Al (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0mM) salts for 5weeks; growth was not affected at concentrations up to 2.5mM even with Al concentration reaching 6000μgg(-1) DW. In roots, the citrate content also increased with increasing Al application. Concurrently, the activities of aconitase and NADP(+)-isocitrate dehydrogenase, which catalyze the decomposition of citrate, decreased. On the other hand, the activity of citrate synthase was not affected at concentrations up to 2.5mM Al. (27)Al-NMR spectroscopic analyses were carried out where it was found that Al-citrate complexes were a major chemical form present in cell sap of root tips. These findings suggested that E. camaldulensis detoxifies Al by forming Al-citrate complexes, and that this is achieved through Al-induced citrate accumulation in root tips via suppression of the citrate decomposition pathway.

The most active bacterial community (235.7 mmol H2S/g VSS) was selected from among eight consortia. The peat moss was pre-treated with different HCl concentrations and contact times. The best combination of treatments was 20% HCl for 10 min. The constant substrate affinity Ks was 740 mg COD/L and the ratio COD/SO4(2-) was 0.71.

Significant disintegration of sludge solids (up to 75.6%) and an increase in methane production (up to 70.6%) were observed in the pretreatment trials. Two quadratic models were successfully generated by response surface analysis (R(2)>0.9, p<0.05) to approximate how the degree of sludge disintegration (SD) and methane production (MP) respond to changes in the pretreatment conditions. The maximum responses of SD (77.8%) and MP (73.9% increase over the control) were shown at [0.16 M NaOH, 90°C] and [0.10 M NaOH, 73.7°C], respectively.

With increasing initial MG concentration, the decolorization efficiency decreased, and the kinetic parameters, R(MG,max) and K(m) were 416.7 mg-MG/g-cell/h and 1033.7 mg/L, respectively. The D. radiodurans R1 cells were capable of tolerating and rapidly degrading high concentrations of the dye. When MG concentration was 200 mg/L, decolorization efficiency was up to 97.2% within 30 min. The intermediate products of MG biodegradation were 4-(dimethylamino)phenol and 4-(dimethylamino)benzophenone, as identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis. Toxicity tests indicated that D. radiodurans R1 did not detoxify an MG solution completely, but clearly reduced its toxicity. This study demonstrated that this strain was an efficient degrader compared to other microorganisms.', 23880129: 'The inhibitive effect of total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) (including NH3 and NH4(+)) on solid-state anaerobic digestion of corn stover was investigated in batch reactors at 37°C. The highest methane yield of 107.0 L/kg VS(feed) was obtained at a TAN concentration of 2.5 g/kg (based on total weight). TAN concentrations greater than 2.5 g/kg resulted in decreased methane yields, with a 50% reduction observed at a concentration of 6.0 g/kg. Reduced reaction rates and microbial activities for hydrolysis of cellulose and methanogenesis from acetate were observed at TAN concentrations higher than 4.3 g/kg. Strong ammonia stress was indicated at butyrate concentrations higher than 300 mg/kg. Result showed that the effluent of liquid anaerobic digestion can provide enough nitrogen for solid-state anaerobic digestion of corn stover.', 23886853: 'A 6-month trial was carried out to study operational conditions and process dynamics in a system of six continuously fed aerated tank bioreactors grouped by serial connection. Feedback was with NH3-stripped solution after biological treatment, with the purpose of lowering the NH3 content of the feedback solution in order to improve the process. The fate of carbon and nutrients during treatment were determined, as well as the ammonia stripping performance of the biological treatment. The results of the study confirmed the dynamic nature of the serial system and indicated its resistance to process disturbances. The feedback of slurry resulted in a dilution effect and significantly reduced the carbon and nutrients concentrations in the first tank, increasing the treatment efficiency. Overall, after mechanical separation, low intensity aeration treatment and ammonia stripping, up to 61%, 67%, 79% and 83% average reductions of TS, Ntot, NH4(+)-N and Ptot, respectively, were reached.

Acclimated biomass was obtained from a fill and draw reactor fed with peptone mixture selected as synthetic substrate and operated at a sludge age of 10 days. Acute inhibition was tested in batch reactors involving a control unit started solely with substrate and the others with additional doses of each antibiotic. Modeling indicated that both steps of nitrification were totally blocked by erythromycin. Tetracycline inhibited and retarded nitrification kinetics at 50 mg/L and stopped nitrite oxidation at 200 mg/L, leading to nitrite accumulation. Both antibiotics also affected organic carbon removal by inducing partial inactivation of the heterotrophic community in the culture, increased substrate storage and accelerated endogenous respiration, with a relatively slight impact on heterotrophic growth. Major inhibitory effect was on process stoichiometry, leading to partial utilization of organic substrate.', 23896178: 'Contamination of soils with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is a serious problem in petroleum producing countries, such as México, and environment-friendly easy to apply techniques are required to accelerate the removal of the contaminants. Removal of anthracene was monitored in an arable and a pasture soil regularly mixed or amended with organic material, a non-ionic surfactant (Surfynol(®) 485) or earthworms (Eisenia fetida (Savigny, 1826)). In both soils the same results were obtained although the removal of anthracene was faster from the pasture than from the arable soil. The fastest removal of anthracene was obtained when the soil was mixed every 7 days and no contaminant was detected in both soils after 56 days. The second fastest removal of anthracene was obtained when earthworms were added to soil and no contaminant was detected in both soils after 112 days. Application of organic material that served as feed for the earthworms also accelerated the removal of the contaminant compared to the unamended soil, but application of the surfactant inhibited the dissipation of the contaminant. Only 37% of the spiked anthracene was removed from soil when surfactant was applied, while 62% was dissipated in the unamended soil after 112 days. It was found that simply mixing a soil removed anthracene faster than when earthworms were applied, while the application of the surfactant inhibited the removal of anthracene by the autochthonous soil microorganisms.

The understanding of their corrosive mechanism in physiological environments is therefore essential for making application-orientated designs. Thus, this in vitro study was designed to assess the effects of CO2 on corrosive behavior of AZ31D to mimic in vivo special ingredient. Electrochemical technologies accompanied with Scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction, Energy dispersive spectroscopy and hydrogen evolution measurement were employed to analyze corrosive rates and mechanisms of AZ31D. Moreover, the biocompatibility of AZ31D was assessed with a direct cell attachment assay and an indirect cytotoxicity test in different diluted extracts. The ion concentrations in extracts were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry to offer explanations on the differences of cell viability in the indirect test. The results of the direct cytotoxicity assay showed that the corrosive rate of AZ31D was too rapid to allow for cell adhesion. Extracts diluted less than 20 times would cause adverse effects on cell proliferation, likely due to excessive ions and gas release. Moreover, the presence of CO2 did not cause significant differences on corrosive behavior of AZ31D according to the results of electrochemical testing and hydrogen evolution measurement. This might be caused by the simultaneous process of precipitation and dissolution of MgCO3 due to the penetration role of CO2. This analysis of corrosive atmospheres on the degradation behavior of magnesium alloys would contribute to the design of more scientific in vitro testing systems in the future.

The experimental results showed that after 4weeks implantation of AZ31 alloy in the osteoporosis modeled rats, the expression of BMP-2 in bone tissues of the rats was much enhanced, even higher than the control group, which should promote the bone formation and be beneficial for reducing the harmful effect of osteoporosis. Results of HE stains showed that the implantation of AZ31 alloy did not have obvious pathological changes on both the liver and kidney of the animal.

C. aculeolata and N. opaca were exposed to various concentrations of Cd (0.25 and 0.5 mg/L), Pb (5 and 10 mg/L) and Zn (5 and 10 mg/L) solutions under hydroponic conditions for 6 days. C. aculeolata was more tolerant of Cd and Pb than N. opaca. The relative growth rate of N. opaca was drastically reduced at high concentrations of Cd and Pb although both were tolerant of Zn. Both macroalgae showed a reduction in chloroplast, chlorophyll and carotenoid content after Cd and Pb exposure, while Zn exposure had little effects. The bioaccumulation of both Cd and Pb was higher in N. opaca (1544.3 microg/g at 0.5 mg/L Cd, 21657.0 microg/g at 10 mg/L Pb) whereas higher Zn accumulation was observed in C. aculeolata (6703.5 microg/g at 10 mg/L Zn). In addition, high bioconcentration factor values (> 1000) for Cd and Pb were observed in both species. C. aculeolata showed higher percentage of Cd and Pb removal (> 95%) than N. opaca and seemed to be a better choice for Cd and Pb removal from wastewater due to its tolerance to these metals.', 23923436: 'We report on the biodegradation of pure hydrocarbons and chemotaxis towards these compounds by an isolated chlorophenol degrader, Pseudomonas strain H. The biochemical and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA sequence identified Pseudomonas strain H as having 99.56% similarity with P. aeruginosa PA01. This strain was able to degrade n-hexadecane, 1-undecene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene and kerosene. It grew in the presence of 1-octene, while this hydrocarbons is toxic to other hydrocarbons degraders. Pseudomonas strain H was also chemotactic towards n-hexadecane, kerosene, 1-undecene and 1-dodecene. These results show that this Pseudomonas strain H is an attractive candidate for hydrocarbon-containing wastewater bioremediation in controlled environments. Since the classical standard techniques for detecting chemotaxis are not efficient at low bacterial concentrations, we demonstrate the use of the dynamic speckle laser method, which is simple and inexpensive, to confirm bacterial chemotaxis at low cell concentrations (less than 10(5) colony-forming unit per millilitre (CFU/mL)) when hydrocarbons are the attractants.', 23923786: 'To accelerate the efficiency of methane biodegradation in landfills, a Gram-negative, rod-shaped, non-motile, non-spore-forming bacterium, JTA1, which can utilize methane as well as acetate, was isolated from the Laogang MSW landfills, Shanghai, China. Strain JTA1 was a member of genus Methylocystis on the basis of 16S rRNA and pmoA gene sequence similarity. The maximum specific cell growth rates (micro(max) = 0.042 hr(-1), R2 = 0.995) was derived through Boltzmann simulation, and the apparent half-saturation constants (K(m(app)) = 7.08 mmol/L, R2 = 0.982) was calculated according to Michaelis-Menton hyperbolic model, indicating that Methylocystis strain JTA1 had higher-affinity potential for methane oxidation than other reported methanotrophs. By way of adding the strain JTA1 culture, the methane consumption of aged refuse reached 115 mL, almost two times of control experiment. In addition, high tolerance of Methylocystis strain JTA1 to chloroform could facilitate the methane oxidation of aged refuse bio-covers. At the chloroform concentration of 50 mg/L, the methane-oxidation rate of bio-cover reached 0.114 mL/(day x g), much higher than the highest rate, 0.0135 mL/(day x g), of reported bio-covers.

This study investigated the feasibility of using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MCD) solution to enhance ex situ soil washing for extracting PAHs. Treatment with elevated temperature (50 degrees C) in combination with ultrasonication (35 kHz, 30 min) at 100 g x L(-1) was effective. It was found that 96.7% +/- 2.4% of 3-ring PAH, 89.7% +/- 3.2% of 4-ring PAH, 76.3% +/- 2.2% of 5 (+6)-ring PAH and 91.3% +/- 3.1% of total PAHs were removed from soil after five successive washing cycles. The desorption kinetics of PAHs from contaminated soil was determined before and after successive washings. The 400 h Tenax extraction of PAHs from soil was decreasing gradually with increasing washing times. Furthermore, the F(r), F(sl), k(r), k(sl) and k(vl) were significantly lower than those of CK (P < 0.01).

Besides characteristic of aerobic denitrification, strain LYM was confirmed in terms of the ability to be heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification (HNAD) with few accumulations of intermediates. After the nitrogen balance and enzyme assays, the putative nitrogen pathway of HNAD could be NH4(+) → NH2OH → NO2(-)→ NO3(-), then NO3(-) was denitrified to gaseous products via nitrite.

The highest volumetric removal rate (13.3 kg COD/m(3)d) and the highest thermo-stable protease activity (0.95 unit/mL) were detected at OLR=18.6 kg COD/m(3)d. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles and quantitative PCR (qPCR) results showed significant microbial community shifts in response to changes in OLR.

Color could be removed from the piggery wastewater by means of oxidation (H2O2-UV) or by means of positively charged flocculants (e.g., ferric chloride, magnesium hydroxide), biopolymers (chitosan, cationic starch) or adsorbents (hydrotalcite). Some methods remove not only color but also phosphate (e.g., hydrotalcite) while other do not affect phosphate concentrations (e.g., chitosan). Color removal using chitosan resulted in a doubling of initial growth rate and a 50% increase in final biomass yield of Arthrospira produced on piggery wastewater. Color removal using hydrotalcite resulted in a low biomass yield of Arthrospira due to phosphate limitation.

Nitrogen supplementation can also accelerate tetrabromobisphenol A degradation. Organic nitrogen is generally better than inorganic nitrogen. A response surface methodology based on the central composite design was applied to determine the optimum conditions. It showed that concentration of sodium formate, yeast extraction, tetrabromobisphenol A, and inoculum size of microorganism were important factors, and the interaction between either of two variables played different roles.

A large amount of phosphorus is found in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) matrix of these microorganisms. However, the roles of EPS in phosphorus removal have not been fully understood. In this study, the phosphorus in the EBPR sludge was fractionated and further analyzed using quantitative (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The amounts and forms of phosphorus in EPS as well as their changes in an anaerobic-aerobic process were also investigated. EPS could act as a reservoir for phosphorus in the anaerobic-aerobic process. About 5-9% of phosphorus in sludge was reserved in the EPS at the end of the aerobic phase and might further contribute to the phosphorus removal. The chain length of the intracellular long-chain polyphosphate (polyP) decreased in the anaerobic phase and then recovered under aerobic conditions. However, the polyP in the EPS had a much shorter chain length than the intracellular polyP in the whole cycle. The migration and transformation of various forms of phosphorus among microbial cells, EPS, and bulk liquid were also explored. On the basis of these results, a model with a consideration of the roles of EPS was proposed, which is beneficial to elucidate the mechanism of phosphorus removal in the EBPR system.

The present study looked at removal of chromium (VI) in presence of phenol in a counter-current continuous packed bed reactor packed with E. coli cells immobilized on clay chips. The cells removed 85% of 500 mg/L of chromium (VI) from MS media containing glucose. Glucose was then replaced by 500 mg/L phenol. Temperature and pH of the MS media prior to addition of phenol were 30°C and 7, respectively.

PCA dechlorination was inhibited at 5 μM AB and was completely inhibited at 25 or 5 μM by AB or HD, respectively. However, the PCA dechlorination pathway was the same in both the QACs-free and QACs-amended culture series. Fermentation (acidogenesis) and methanogenesis were inhibited by both AB and HD at and above 25 μM but to a lesser degree than PCA dechlorination. Overall, HD resulted in a more severe inhibition of the mixed culture than AB. Adsorption of both QACs to the mixed culture biomass followed the Freundlich isotherm model. The adsorption affinity of HD for the mixed culture biomass was significantly higher than that of AB, which may be related to the observed higher inhibitory effects of HD compared to AB.

The addition of appropriate surfactants and additional carbon sources could enhance the biodegradation efficiency of BDE-209. The presence of Cu(2+) (≤ 8 mg/L) and Zn(2+) (≤ 15 mg/L) provided a slight stimulating effect on BDE-209 removal. However, BDE-209 biodegradation efficiency was decreased when adding higher levels of metals due to reduced substrate availability caused by excess metal adsorption into the cell surface.

In STP-A, 83 BPTs comprising 123 isolates were found in IS and STE, of which 7 BPTs survived UV irradiation. Isolates tested from the same sites of STP-B (n = 220) comprised 122 BPTs, however, only two BPTs were found post-chlorination. A representative isolate from each BPT from both STPs was tested for the presence of 11 virulence genes (VGs) associated with uropathogenic (UPEC) or intestinal pathogenic (IPEC) E. coli strains. Strains surviving UV irradiation were distributed among seven phylogenetic groups with five BPTs carrying VGs associated with either UPEC (4 BPTs) or IPEC (1 BPT). In contrast, E. coli strains found in STP-B carried no VGs. Strains from both STPs were resistant to up to 12 out of the 21 antibiotics tested but there was no significant difference between the numbers of antibiotics to which surviving strains were resistant to in these STPs. Our data suggests that some E. coli strains have a better ability to survive STPs utilising chlorination and UV irradiation for disinfection.

In this study, NZVI (average size = 55 ± 11 nm) showed inhibition of methanogenesis due to its disruption of cell integrity. The inhibition was coincident with the fast hydrogen production and accumulation due to NZVI dissolution under anaerobic conditions. At the concentrations of 1 mM and above, NZVI reduced methane production by more than 20%. At the concentration of 30 mM, NZVI led to a significant increase in soluble COD (an indication of cell disruption) and volatile fatty acids in the mixed liquor along with an accumulation of H2, resulting in a reduction of methane production by 69% (±4% [standard deviation]). By adding a specific methanogenesis inhibitor-sodium 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) to the anaerobic sludge containing 30 mM NZVI, the amount of H2 produced was only 79% (±1%) of that with heat-killed sludge, indicating the occurrence of bacterially controlled hydrogen utilization processes. Quantitative PCR data was in accordance with the result of methanogenesis inhibition, as the level of methanogenic population (dominated by Methanosaeta) in the presence of 30 mM NZVI decreased significantly compared to that of the control. On the contrary, ZVI powder (average size <212 μm) at the same concentration (30 mM) increased methane production presumably due to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis of hydrogen gas that was slowly released from the NZVI powder. While it is a known fact that NZVI disrupts cell membranes, which inhibited methanogenesis described herein, the results suggest that the rapid hydrogen production due to NZVI dissolution also contribute to methanogenesis inhibition and lead to bacterially controlled hydrogenotrophic processes.', 24117277: 'The effects of organic carbon concentrations and loading on the degradation of estrone (E1) were examined under various conditions in batch reactors and membrane-coupled bioreactors (MBRs). Experiments examined effects on individual microorganisms (substrate competition and growth) and on the whole community (selection). Substrate competition with organic carbon (competitive inhibition and catabolic repression) was not a factor in E1 degradation (P = 0.19 and 0.29 for two different analyses). Conversely, addition of organic carbon increased E1 degradation rates, attributable to biomass growth in feast-famine reactors over a five-day period (P = 0.016). Subsequently, however, community dynamics controlled E1 degradation rates, with other organisms outcompeting E1 degraders. More moderate but sustained increases in E1 degradation rates were observed under starvation conditions. Low influent organic carbon strength was detrimental to E1 degradation in MBRs, where organic carbon concentration and loading were decoupled (P = 0.018). These results point to the importance of multiple substrate utilizers in E1 degradation. They also suggest that while initial growth of biomass depends on the presence of sufficient organic carbon, further enrichment under starvation conditions may improve E1 degradation capability via the growth and/or stimulation of multiple substrate utilizers rather than heterotrophs characterized by an r-strategist growth regime.

The enzyme was found to be a functional homotrimer (150 kDa) with subunit molecular mass of 50 kDa and contained calcium (1.8 mol/mol of enzyme). These properties were found to be unique. External addition of metal ions showed no effect on the activity and addition of chelators showed moderate inhibition of the activity. Potassium ions were found to enhance the activity significantly. SALDH showed higher affinity for salicylaldehyde (Km\\u2009=\\u20094.5 μM) and accepts mono- as well as di-aromatic aldehydes; however it showed poor activity on aliphatic aldehydes. Chloro-/nitro-substituted benzaldehydes were potent substrate inhibitors as compared to benzaldehyde and 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde, while 2-naphthaldehyde and salicylaldehyde were moderate. The kinetic data revealed that SALDH, though having broad specificity, is more efficient for the oxidation of salicylaldehyde as compared to other aromatic aldehyde dehydrogenases which gives an advantage for Pseudomonas sp. strain C6 to bioremediate carbaryl and other aromatic aldehydes efficiently.', 24122713: 'Chelatococcus daeguensis TAD1 was demonstrated to be an aerobic denitrifier.

This operation also involves hair destruction, a process that leads to increased chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), and total suspended solid (TSS) loads in the effluent. With these concerns in mind, enzyme-assisted dehairing has often been proposed as an alternative method. The main enzyme preparations so far used involved keratinases. The present paper reports on the purification of an extracellular keratinase (KERUS) newly isolated from Brevibacillus brevis strain US575. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis revealed that the purified enzyme was a monomer with a molecular mass of 29121.11 Da. The sequence of the 27 N-terminal residues of KERUS showed high homology with those of Bacillus keratinases. Optimal activity was achieved at pH 8 and 40°C. Its thermoactivity and thermostability were upgraded in the presence of 5 mM Ca(2+). The enzyme was completely inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and diiodopropyl fluorophosphates (DFP), which suggests that it belongs to the serine protease family. KERUS displayed higher levels of hydrolysis, substrate specificity, and catalytic efficiency than NUE 12 MG and KOROPON® MK EG keratinases. The enzyme also exhibited powerful keratinolytic activity that made it able to accomplish the entire feather-biodegradation process on its own. The kerUS gene encoding KERUS was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The biochemical properties of the extracellular purified recombinant enzyme (rKERUS) were similar to those of native KERUS. Overall, the findings provide strong support for the potential candidacy of this enzyme as an effective and eco-friendly alternative to the conventional chemicals used for the dehairing of rabbit, goat, sheep and bovine hides in the leather processing industry.

In order to enhance the accessibility of sludge to the enzyme secreting bacteria; the extracellular polymeric substances were removed using EDTA. EDTA efficiently removed the EPS with limited cell lysis and enhanced the sludge enzyme activity at its lower concentration of 0.2 g/g SS. The sludge was then subjected to bacterial pretreatment to enhance the aerobic digestion. In aerobic digestion the best results in terms of Suspended solids (SS) reduction (48.5%) and COD (Chemical oxygen demand) solubilization (47.3%) was obtained in experimental reactor than in control. These results imply that aerobic digestion can be enhanced efficiently through bacterial pretreatment of EPS removed sludge.', 24177157: 'In this study, the microalgae culture system to combined active treatment system and pipe inserted microalgae reactor (PIMR) was investigated. After pretreated AMD in active treatment system, the effluent load to PIMR in order to Nephroselmis sp. KGE 8 culture. In experiment, effect of iron on growth and lipid accumulation in microalgae were inspected. The 2nd pretreatment effluent was economic feasibility of microalgae culture and lipid accumulation. The growth kinetics of the microalgae are modeled using logistic growth model and the model is primarily parameterized from data obtained through an experimental study where PIMR were dosed with BBM, BBM added 10 mg L(-1) iron and 2nd pretreatment effluent. Moreover, the continuous of microalgae culture in PIMR can be available. Overall, this study indicated that the use of pretreated AMD is a viable method for culture microalgae and lipid accumulation.', 24177158: 'Coffee grounds are deemed to be difficult for degradation by thermophilic anaerobic process. In this research, a 7 L AnMBR accepting coffee grounds was operated for 82 days and failed with pH dropping to 6.6. The deficiency of micronutrients in the reactor was identified. The system was recovered by supplying micronutrient, pH adjustment and influent ceasing for 22 days. In the subsequent 160 days of co-digestion experiment, waste activated sludge (15% in the mixture) was mixed into coffee grounds. The COD conversion efficiency of 67.4% was achieved under OLR of 11.1 kg-COD/m(3) d and HRT of 20 days. Tannins was identified affecting protein degradation by a batch experiment. Quantitative supplements of NH4HCO3 (0.12 g-N/g-TSin) were effective to maintain alkalinity and pH. The solid concentration in the AnMBR reached 75 g/L, but it did not significantly affect membrane filtration under a flux of 5.1 L/m(2) h.

The recombinant azoreductase (BrAzo) is a monomeric FMN oxygen-insensitive enzyme with a molecular mass of 23 kDa showing a broad specificity for the reduction of synthetic azo dyes. Double hexahistidine-tagged BrAzo was immobilized onto a nickel chelating column and methyl orange was used to assess its degradation potential using a packed-bed reactor. The dye degradation is described by an exponential model in a downstream batchwise continuous flow mode operated with recycling. The complete degradation of methyl orange (170 μM at 600 mL/h) was achieved in 3 h and continued over 9 cycles. Coupling the immobilized BrAzo with glucose dehydrogenase for NADH regeneration yielded a shorter 1.5 h-degradation period that was maintained throughout 16 cycles.', 24185035: 'A bacterium capable of methanethiol (MT) degradation was enriched and isolated by employing activated sewage sludge as the inoculum in a mineral medium containing MT. The isolate was identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa CZ05 through a Biolog test and 16S rDNA sequencing. This strain can utilize both organic and inorganic media and thrives at pH 4 to 9. The batch culture showed that the strain can degrade MT better in the No. 4 medium than in the No. 1 medium. A series-operating biotrickling filter with lava stone as the carrier was employed to test the application of P. polymyxa CZ05 in the removal of MT in simulated biogas. Long-term experiments showed that a high concentration of MT (60 ppm) was efficiently removed (99.5%) by the biotrickling filters at EBRT 30 s. The addition of hydrogen sulfide decreased the MT removal rate because the dissolved oxygen competed with MT.', 24185418: 'An advanced wastewater treatment process involving Sludge reduction, Inorganic solids separation, Phosphorus recovery, and Enhanced nutrient Removal (SIPER) was developed to reduce sludge production, prevent the accumulation of inorganic solids, recover phosphorus, and enhance nutrient removal. The feasibility of recovering carbon (C)-source from excess sludge to enhance nutrient removal and the sludge reduction potential of the process was evaluated. The results showed that sludge hydrolysis and acidification yields were 20±3% and 34±2%, respectively. The COD/TN and VFA/TP ratios for the supernatant of alkaline-treated sludge were 2.8 and 2.5 times those in the influent, respectively. Nutrients were removed effectively in the system, especially TN, for which the removal efficiency reached 80±2%. The C-source recovered from the excess sludge was successfully employed as an internal C-source for enhanced nutrient removal. The observed sludge yield of the system was 0.096 g VSS g COD(-1), demonstrating the excellent sludge reduction potential of this process.', 24189380: 'Substitution of conventional feedstock with waste based alternatives is one route towards both remediation and reducing costs associated with production of algal biomass. This work explores whether exhaust gases and wastewater can replace conventional feedstock in the production of biomass from Chlorella sorokiniana. Exhaust gases were used to augment production in final effluent, anaerobic digester centrate or in standard medium. Cultures were grown in 1L bottles under illumination of 80 μmol m(-2) s(-1). The results showed an average μmax ranging between 0.04 and 0.07 h(-1), whilst the final biomass yield in different media ranged between 220 and 330 mg L(-1). Lipid yield was increased over time to 31 mg L(-1). CO2 addition resulted in complete nitrogen removal between 48 and 96 h in both final effluent and centrate.

Growth of SAL and the other two marine Shewanella strains coupled to anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) reduction was observed in a wide range of NaCl concentrations (0-7%). AQDS showed the best enhancing effects, whereas some other quinones demonstrated poorer stimulating or even inhibiting effects on acid red 27 (AR27) decolorization. Different humic acids could also enhance the decolorization. The correlation between specific AQDS-mediated reduction rate and initial AR27 concentration could be described with Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km=0.2 mM and Vmax=9.3 μmol mg cell(-1) h(-1)). AQDS reduction by SAL was determined to be the rate-limiting step of mediated reduction. Mediated decolorization products of AR27 were determined to be less phytotoxic aromatic amines.', 24191497: 'Photodegradation mechanism of sulfadiazine (SD) in a solution containing Fe(III), oxalate and algae were investigated in this study. The results indicated that the degradation of SD was slow in a solution containing Fe(III) or oxalate, whereas it was markedly enhanced when Fe(III) and oxalate coexisted. The optimal pH for formation of *OH was 4; a higher or lower pH resulted in a decrease in formation of OH. A moderate increase of oxalate concentration was beneficial to the formation of *OH and the degradation of SD, and the algae enhanced the degradation rate of SD in a solution containing Fe(III) and oxalate. Also, the degradation rate of SD rapidly decreased at low initial concentrations but slowly decreased at high initial concentrations, and pseudo-first order kinetics described the degradation process of SD well. A possible reaction mechanism in solution containing Fe(III), oxalate and algae was proposed, and attack by *OH was the main pathway of SD degradation in the photocatalytic reaction.', 24200953: \"The colloidal and biological properties of the two single-chain surfactants N-benzyl-N,N-dimethyl-N-(1-dodecyl)ammonium bromide (PH12) and N-cyclohexylmethyl-N,N-dimethyl-N-(1-dodecyl)ammonium bromide (CH12) and their two dimeric counterparts N,N'-(1,3-phenylenebis(methylene))bis(N,N-dimethyl-N-(1-dodecyl)ammonium dibromide (12PH12) and N,N'-(cyclohexane-1,3-diylbis(methylene))bis(N,N-dimethyl-N-(1-dodecyl)ammonium dibromide (12CH12) were investigated. The thermodynamic functions of the self-aggregation process were estimated by using calorimetric measurements and the micellization enthalpy values, ΔHM, were examined considering the different enthalpic contributions to ΔHM. In the investigation of the structure-property relationship, it was found that the surfactant structure does not influence practically the foamability of the surfactants, but it plays a key role in their solubilization capacity, antimicrobial activity and biodegradability.\", 24211828: 'Salvinia minima Baker is a small floating aquatic fern that is efficient for the removal and storage of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium. In this study, we report that lead removal by S. minima causes large accumulation of lead inside the cells in the form of nanoparticles (PbNPs). The accumulation pattern of lead was analyzed in both, submerged root-like modified fronds (here named \"roots\"), and in its aerial leaf-like fronds (\"leaves\"). Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed the biosynthesis of PbNPs by the plant. In both, roots and leaves, PbNPs were found to accumulate almost exclusively at the cell wall and closely associated to the cell membrane. Two types of PbNPs shapes were found in cells of both tissues, those associated to the cell wall were quasi-spherical with 17.2±4.2 nm of diameter, while those associated to the cell membrane/cytoplasm were elongated. Elongated particles were 53.7±29.6 nm in length and 11.1±2.4 nm wide. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) results indicate that cellulose, lignin and pectin are the major components that may be acting as the reducing agents for lead ions; these findings strongly suggest the potential use of this fern to further explore the bio-assisted synthesis of heavy metal nanostructures.', 24216621: 'A potential biofilm forming and phenanthrene utilizing marine bacterium Pseudomonas mendocina NR802 was isolated from Rushukulya, Odisha, East Coast of India. The effect of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) on biofilm growth and phenanthrene degradation was evaluated. Among the various tested concentrations, 20 mM of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) showed a significant enhancement in biofilm production by the bacterium. The SEM-EDAX study showed that the elemental composition of the biofilm varied significantly when grown in the presence of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+). The CSLM analysis of biofilms grown in the presence of 20 mM Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) reveal the critical role of these ions on biofilm architectural parameters such as total biomass, biofilm thickness, roughness coefficient and surface to biovolume ratio. Ca(2+) was found to enhance the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production and phenanthrene degradation. Ca(2+) enhanced the biofilm growth in a dose dependent manner, whereas Mg(2+) significantly increased the cell growth in biofilm. More than 15% increase in phenanthrene degradation was observed when biofilm was grown in the presence of an additional 20 mM Ca(2+). This study also supports the fundamental role of Ca(2+) in biofilm growth, architecture as well as biofilm-mediated pollutant degradation.', 24222753: 'Degradation of chlorobenzoic acids (e.g., products of microbial degradation of PCB) by strains of microorganisms isolated from PCB contaminated soils was assessed. From seven bulk-soil isolates two strains unique in ability to degrade a wider range of chlorobenzoic acids than others were selected, individually and even in a complex mixture of 11 different chlorobenzoic acids. Such a feature is lacking in most tested degraders. To investigate the influence of vegetation on chlorobenzoic acids degraders, root exudates of two plant species known for supporting PCB degradation in soil were tested. While with individual chlorobenzoic acids the presence of plant exudates leads to a decrease of degradation yield, in case of a mixture of chlorobenzoic acids either a change in bacterial degradation specificity, associated with 3- and 4-chlorobenzoic acid, or an extension of the spectrum of degraded chlorobenzoic acids was observed.

The membrane assisted biomass retention in AnMBRs provided an excellent solution to sludge washout problems reported for the treatment of lipid rich wastewaters by granular sludge bed reactors. The AnMBRs achieved high COD removal efficiencies up to 99% and excellent effluent quality. Although higher organic loading rates (OLRs) up to 8.0\\xa0kg COD\\xa0m(-3)\\xa0d(-1) could be applied to the reactors operated at shorter SRTs, better biological degradation efficiencies, i.e. up to 83%, was achieved at increased SRTs. Severe long chain fatty acid (LCFA) inhibition was observed at 50 days SRT, possibly caused by the extensive dissolution of LCFA in the reactor broth, inhibiting the methanogenic biomass. Physicochemical mechanisms such as precipitation with divalent cations and adsorption on the sludge played an important role in the occurrence of LCFA removal, conversion, and inhibition.

The digestion thereafter proceeded more efficiently due to the inoculation by oil degrading bacteria (Bacillus). A 2-stage pre-mixing is more effective than directly mixing. The effects on the methane production were also investigated by pre-treatment with ultrasonic (US) treatment, combined with citric acid (CA) addition. US pre-treatment was found to improve the initial methane production, and CA pre-treatment could maintain this improvement during the whole digestion stage. Pre-mixing Bacillus at 9 wt.% inoculation, combined with US for 10 min and a CA concentration of 500 mg/L provided the optimum conditions. The most effective enhancement of methane yield was 1100.46 ml/g VS, exceeding that of the control by 280%.

The effects of dosing Fe(2+) on effluent quality and sludge characteristics of the pre-denitrification stage were assessed with comparing to the cases of no additional chemical dosing and dosing Fe(3+). Results obtained demonstrated a sound performance of synergistic denitrification and chemical precipitation in pre-denitrification of the modified BAF process when dosing Fe salts, which showed enhanced by using Fe(2+) as the dosed precipitant in increasing the denitrification loading rate, exhibiting a better controlling of the residual phosphorus in pre-denitrification effluent, and improving sludge settleability. Dosing Fe salt showed no adverse impact in removing COD, but resulted in a relatively higher SS content in the pre-denitrification effluent.

Formation of drug resistance is a matter of general concern when antibiotics such as flumquine occur in the environment. Thus, biodegradation of flumequine in solution was investigated using five different ligninolytic fungi. Irpex lacteus, Dichomitus squalens, and Trametes versicolor proved most efficient and transformed more than 90% of flumequine within 6 or even 3 days. Panus tigrinus and Pleurotus ostreatus required up to 14 days to remove >90% of flumequine. Analyses of the metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry suggest different transformation pathways for the different fungal strains. Structure proposals were elaborated for 8 metabolites. 7-Hydroxy-flumequine and flumequine ethyl ester were identified as common metabolites produced by all ligninolytic fungi. The largest variety of metabolites was formed by D. squalens. Residual antibacterial activity of the metabolite mixtures was tested using gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. While for the less efficient P. tigrinus and P. ostreatus cultures the antibacterial activities corresponded to the residual concentrations of flumequine, a remarkable antibacterial activity remained in the D. squalens cultures although flumequine was transformed to more than 90%. Obviously, antibacterially active transformation products were formed by this fungal strain.

The methane production and biomass digestion were efficient at OLRs below 2.33 gVS L(-1) d(-1) but were deteriorated as OLR increased because of the increased total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentration from cell protein decay. The thermal-alkaline pretreatment with 0.10 NaOH/TS at 70°C for 2 h significantly improved the digestion performance.

This includes the toxic metal cadmium (Cd), which prevails in agricultural soils and is taken up by crops. Fe(III)-reducing bacteria can mobilize such contaminants by Fe(III) mineral dissolution or immobilize them by sorption to or coprecipitation with secondary Fe minerals. To date, not much is known about the fate of Fe(III) mineral-associated Cd during microbial Fe(III) reduction. Here, we describe the isolation of a new Geobacter sp. strain Cd1 from a Cd-contaminated field site, where the strain accounts for 10(4) cells g(-1) dry soil. Strain Cd1 reduces the poorly crystalline Fe(III) oxyhydroxide ferrihydrite in the presence of at least up to 112 mg Cd L(-1). During initial microbial reduction of Cd-loaded ferrihydrite, sorbed Cd was mobilized. However, during continuous microbial Fe(III) reduction, Cd was immobilized by sorption to and/or coprecipitation within newly formed secondary minerals that contained Ca, Fe, and carbonate, implying the formation of an otavite-siderite-calcite (CdCO3-FeCO3-CaCO3) mixed mineral phase. Our data shows that microbially mediated turnover of Fe minerals affects the mobility of Cd in soils, potentially altering the dynamics of Cd uptake into food or phyto-remediating plants.

The highest bio-crude oil yield (49% of volatile matter) and the highest energy recovery were obtained at 300 °C with 1 h retention time. The highest heating value of the bio-crude oil was 33.3 MJ/kg, produced at 320 °C and 1h retention time. Thermogravimetric analysis showed approximately 60% of the bio-crude oils were distilled in the range of 200-550 °C; and the solid residue might be suitable for use in asphalt. GC-MS results indicated that the bio-crude oil contained hydrocarbons and fatty acids, while the aqueous product was rich in organic acids and cyclic amines.

The effect of pretreatment and mutation of alkali-tolerant bacteria was examined. Pretreatment dissolved most of the base metals, thereby reducing competition for the cyanide ion from other metals. As the pKa of HCN is 9.3, alkaline pH increases the cyanide ion concentration available for bioleaching, and the bacteria were mutated to grow at pH 9, 9.5 and 10. Results showed that at 0.5% pulp density of pretreated ESM, mutated bacteria attained gold biorecovery of 18% at pH 9, 22.5% at pH 9.5 and 19% at pH 10 while that of unadapted bacteria (at pH 7) yielded only 11% recovery.

Degradation of crystalline cellulose, but not that of unpretreated switchgrass, was limited by nitrogen and vitamin (folate) availability. Under optimal conditions, C. bescii solubilized approximately 60% of the crystalline cellulose and 30% of the unpretreated switchgrass using initial substrate concentrations of 50 g L(-1). Further fermentation of crystalline cellulose and of switchgrass was inhibited by organic acid end-products and by a specific inhibitor of C. bescii growth that did not affect other thermophilic bacteria, respectively. Soluble mono- and oligosaccharides, organic acids, carbon dioxide, and microbial biomass, quantitatively accounted for the crystalline cellulose and plant biomass carbon utilized.

Genetic fingerprinting and quantitative PCR (qPCR) indicated a higher abundance of M. parvicella in the digester, when the digestion process was accompanied by excessive foaming relative to the reference digesters without disturbance. The creation of foam depended on the introduced proportion of FOG and the abundance of M. parvicella.

The effluents from Fenton oxidation were analyzed for ecotoxicity, biodegradability, total organic carbon (TOC), COD and intermediate byproducts. The chemical step resulted in a significant improvement of the biodegradability in spite of its negligible or even slightly negative effect on the ecotoxicity. Working at 60% of the stoichiometric H2O2 dose allowed obtaining highly biodegradable effluents in the cases of alachlor and atrazine. That dose was even lower (40% of the stoichiometric) for diuron.

All biomass types were affected by PAR and DOX, with anammox being the most sensitive bacteria. DOX inhibited more the biomass treating high strength nitrogenous effluents (HSNE) than low strength nitrogenous effluents (LSNE). The phosphorus uptake inhibition under anoxic conditions was lower than 25% in the presence of PAR up to 400 mg L(-1). The same DOX concentration inhibited anoxic phosphorus uptake more than 65% for biomass treating LSNE and HSNE.

Growth of the microalgae was inhibited at high light intensity (224μmolphotonsm(-2)s(-1) at the surface of the vessels). However, the growth was not greatly affected by the high solid content and turbidity of the effluent. The microalga was able to grow in media containing NH4-N at concentrations of up to 1000mgL(-1) (50% of effluent) and to remove 88mg of NH4-NL(-1) in 10days.

Degradation of polyacrylamide accompanied with accumulation of its toxic monomer is important to disposition of biogas residues.

The adjoining amide group can combined into ether group after biodegradation. PAM can be broken down in different position of its carbon chain backbone. In actual sludge system, the hydrolytic PAM was liable to combined tyrosine-rich protein to form colloid complex, and then consumed as carbon source to form monomer when easily degradable organics were exhausted.

After a first oxidation step leading to catechol in mesophilic and thermophilic microorganisms, two main routes have been identified depending on the cleavage of the aromatic ring: ortho involving a catechol 1,2 dioxygenase (C12D) and meta involving a catechol 2,3 dioxygenase (C23D). Our work aimed at elucidating the phenol-degradation pathway in the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus 98/2. For this purpose, the strain was cultivated in a fermentor under different substrate and oxygenation conditions. Indeed, reducing dissolved-oxygen concentration allowed slowing down phenol catabolism (specific growth and phenol-consumption rates dropped 55% and 39%, respectively) and thus, evidencing intermediate accumulations in the broth. HPLC/Diode Array Detector and LC-MS analyses on culture samples at low dissolved-oxygen concentration (DOC \\u200a=\\u200a 0.06 mg x L(-1)) suggested, apart for catechol, the presence of 2-hydroxymuconic acid, 4-oxalocrotonate and 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate, three intermediates of the meta route. RT-PCR analysis on oxygenase-coding genes of S. solfataricus 98/2 showed that the gene coding for the C23D was expressed only on phenol. In 2D-DIGE/MALDI-TOF analysis, the C23D was found and identified only on phenol.

The key objectives are to (a) demonstrate consistent selection and enrichment of PPB using infrared light in a non-sterile medium, and (b) achieve effective partitioning of soluble organics, ammonium and phosphate into the PPB culture. PPB were successfully enriched from pre-settled domestic wastewater within 2-3 days and identified as members of the order Rhodobacterales. Under anaerobic conditions with infrared irradiation the enrichment culture was able to simultaneously remove COD (63\\xa0±\\xa05%), NH4-N (99.6%-0.12\\xa0±\\xa00.03\\xa0mgN\\xa0L(-1)) and PO4-P (88%-0.8\\xa0±\\xa00.6\\xa0mgP\\xa0L(-1)) from primary settled domestic wastewater in 24\\xa0h. In this experiment, acetate was added as an additional carbon source to demonstrate the maximal nitrogen and phosphorous elimination potential. Almost all the COD removed was assimilated into biomass rather than oxidised to CO2, with the total COD actually increasing during the batch experiments due to phototrophic synthesis. NH4-N and PO4-P were also assimilated by the biomass rather than removed through destructive oxidation or accumulation. The process offers the opportunity to concentrate organics and macronutrients from wastewater in one solids stream that can be anaerobically digested to generate energy and recover nutrients from the concentrated digestate. Technical challenges include the design of a continuous reactor system, as well as efficient delivery of electrons, either through light or chemical sources.

Persistence of potentially pathogenic and drug-resistant bacteria during anaerobic digestion of cattle manure was evaluated. Selective cultures were performed for enterobacteria (ENT), non-fermenting Gram-negative rods (NFR) and Gram-positive cocci (GPC). Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined and a decay of all bacterial groups was observed after 60days. Multidrug-resistant bacteria were detected both the influent and effluent. GPC, the most prevalent group was highly resistant against penicillin and levofloxacin, whereas resistance to ampicillin, ampicillin-sulbactam and chloramphenicol was frequently observed in the ENT and NFR groups. The data point out the need of discussions to better address management of biodigesters and the implementation of sanitary and microbiological safe treatments of animal manures to avoid consequences to human, animal and environmental health.

Effects of 0.2g/L l-cysteine on the bioleaching process were further evaluated. It aimed at offering new alternatives for enhancing metal recoveries from nickel-copper sulfide. Results showed a recovery of 80.4% nickel and 68.2% copper in 16-day bioleaching without l-cysteine; while 83.7% nickel and 81.4% copper were recovered in the presence of l-cysteine. Moreover, nickel recovery was always higher than copper recovery. l-Cysteine was found contributing to lower pH value, faster microbial growth, higher Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP), higher zeta potential and absorbing on the sulfide surfaces through amino, carboxyl and sulfhydryl groups. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns of leached residues showed generation of S, jarosite and ammoniojarosite. Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) results revealed that l-cysteine could have variant impacts on different microorganisms and changed the microbial community composition dramatically during nickel-copper sulfide bioleaching.

However, higher [Cr(VI)] may impose stress on syntrophic communities and impact community structure and function. The study objectives were to understand the impacts of Cr(VI) concentrations on community structure and on the Cr(VI)-reduction potential of groundwater communities at Hanford, WA. Steady state continuous flow bioreactors were used to grow native communities enriched with lactate (30 mM) and continuously amended with Cr(VI) at 0.0 (No-Cr), 0.1 (Low-Cr) and 3.0 (High-Cr) mg/L. Microbial growth, metabolites, Cr(VI), 16S rRNA gene sequences and GeoChip based functional gene composition were monitored for 15 weeks. Temporal trends and differences in growth, metabolite profiles, and community composition were observed, largely between Low-Cr and High-Cr bioreactors. In both High-Cr and Low-Cr bioreactors, Cr(VI) levels were below detection from week 1 until week 15. With lactate enrichment, native bacterial diversity substantially decreased as Pelosinus spp., and Sporotalea spp., became the dominant groups, but did not significantly differ between Cr concentrations. The Archaea diversity also substantially decreased after lactate enrichment from Methanosaeta (35%), Methanosarcina (17%) and others, to mostly Methanosarcina spp. (95%). Methane production was lower in High-Cr reactors suggesting some inhibition of methanogens. Several key functional genes were distinct in Low-Cr bioreactors compared to High-Cr. Among the Cr resistant microbes, Burkholderia vietnamiensis, Comamonas testosterone and Ralstonia pickettii proliferated in Cr amended bioreactors. In-situ fermentative conditions facilitated Cr(VI) reduction, and as a result 3.0 mg/L Cr(VI) did not impact the overall bacterial community structure.

Results show that plant growth and phytomass production were impacted by the interaction of heavy metals and pyrene. They were significantly decreased with heavy metal additions (100-2000 mg/kg), but they were only slightly declined with pyrene spiked up to 100 mg/kg. The addition of a moderate dosage of pyrene (100 mg/kg) lessened heavy metal toxicity to plants, resulting in enhanced plant growth and increased metal accumulation in plant tissues, thus improving heavy metal removal by plants. In contrast, heavy metals always reduced both plant growth and pyrene dissipation in soils. The chemical forms of Cu, Cd, and Pb in plant organs varied with metal species and pyrene addition. The dissipation and mineralization of pyrene tended to decline in both planted soil and unplanted soils with the presence of heavy metals, whereas they were enhanced with planting. The results demonstrate the complex interactive effects of organic pollutants and heavy metals on phytoremediation in soils. It can be concluded that, to a certain extent, tall fescue may be useful for phytoremediation of pyrene-heavy metal-contaminated sites. Further work is needed to enhance methods for phytoremediation of heavy metal-organics co-contaminated soil.

TLC 6-6.5-4 is a free-living multiple-metal-resistant plant-growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) isolated from Torch Lake sediment that promotes maize growth and nutrient uptake. In this study, we examined both PGPB-soil and PGPB-plant interactions. PGPB inoculation resulted in significant increase in maize biomass. Soil inoculation before sowing seeds and coating seeds with the PGPB resulted in higher copper uptake by maize compared to other methods. The PGPB-soil interaction improved phosphorus uptake by maize and led to significant decrease in organic bound copper in marginal soil and a notable increase in exchangeable copper. PGPB improved soil health based on soil enzyme activities. Metabolomic analysis of maize revealed that PGPB inoculation upregulated photosynthesis, hormone biosynthesis, and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites. Proteomic analysis identified upregulation of proteins related to plant development and stress response. Further, the activity of antioxidant enzymes and total phenolics decreased in plants grown in marginal soil suggesting alleviation of metal stress in presence of PGPB. The ability of PGPB to modulate interconnected biochemical pathways could be exploited to increase crop productivity in marginal soils, phytoremediation of metal contaminated soils, and organic agriculture.

As a comparison, two amendments of peat bog and zeolite were selected. The results indicated that biochar addition for composting showed a shorter time to enter thermophilic phase (3 d) and a higher temperature (56°C) and longer duration of thermophilic phase compared to that of peat bog addition, zeolite addition and raw composts. The highest C/N ratio and volatile fatty acids' concentration with biochar addition were obtained. Biochar addition also showed more influence on bacterial community changes than that of peat bog and zeolite. Thus, biochar addition could significantly affect physic-chemical process and microbial community diversity on tomato stalk and chicken manure composting.

Understanding the fate of oil in arctic seawater is a key factor for consideration. Here we report the chemical loss due to the biodegradation of Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude oil that would occur in the water column following the successful dispersion of a surface oil slick. Primary biodegradation and mineralization were measured in mesocosms containing Arctic seawater collected from the Chukchi Sea, Alaska, incubated at -1°C. Indigenous microorganisms degraded both fresh and weathered oil, in both the presence and absence of Corexit 9500, with oil losses ranging from 46-61% and up to 11% mineralization over 60 days. When tested alone, 14% of 50 ppm Corexit 9500 was mineralized within 60 days. Our study reveals that microorganisms indigenous to Arctic seawater are capable of performing extensive biodegradation of chemically and physically dispersed oil at an environmentally relevant temperature (-1°C) without any additional nutrients.

Three protocols-photolysis alone (P), biodegradation alone (B), and intimately coupled photolysis and biodegradation (P&B)-were used for degradation of quinoline in batch and continuous-flow experiments. For a 1,000 mg/L initial quinoline concentration, the volumetric removal rate for quinoline was 38 % higher with P&B than with B in batch experiments, and the P&B kinetics were the sum of kinetics from the P and B experiments. Continuous-flow experiments with an influent quinoline concentration of 1,000 mg/L also gave significantly greater quinoline removal in P&B, and the quinoline-removal kinetics for P&B were approximately equal to the sum of the removal kinetics for P and B. P&B similarly increased the rate and extent of quinoline mineralization, for which the kinetics for P&B were nearly equal to the sum of kinetics for P and B. These findings support that the rate-limiting step for mineralization was transformation of quinoline, which was accelerated by the simultaneous action of photolysis and biodegradation.', 24495541: 'In this study, the commercially used model azo dye Acid Orange-7 (AO-7) was fully degraded into less toxic intermediates using an integrated microbial fuel cell (MFC) and aerobic bioreactor system.

It was found that polyphosphate, which accumulates naturally within the wastewater flocs in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process, is capable of producing hydroxyl radicals under UV irradiation and hence causing the photoreactive disinfection of microorganisms embedded within flocs. This phenomenon is likely responsible for the improved UV disinfection of the biological nutrient removal (BNR) effluent compared to that of conventional activated sludge effluent by as much as 1 log. A mathematical model is developed that combines the chemical disinfection by hydroxyl radical formation within flocs, together with the direct inactivation of microorganisms by UV irradiation. The proposed model is able to quantitatively explain the observed improvement in the UV disinfection of the BNR effluents.

The experiments demonstrate that increasing concentrations of NaHCO3 in the system lead to slower U(VI) reduction kinetics. The NaHCO3 concentration also strongly affects the speciation of U(VI) on the bacterial cell envelope. We used a thermodynamic surface complexation modeling approach to determine the speciation and concentration of U(VI) adsorbed onto the bacteria as a function of the NaHCO3 concentration in the experimental systems. We observed a strong positive correlation between the measured U(VI) reduction rates and the calculated total concentration of U(VI) surface complexes formed on the bacterial cell envelope.

The experiments were conducted in two continuous phases of nitrate addition to study denitrification potential using acetylene blockage technique and organic matter mineralization potential indicated by CO2 production in the sediment. Results show that the oil slightly (with no statistical significance p>0.05) increased both the denitrification and organic matter mineralization activities, likely due to oil components serving as additional organic matter. In contrast, the dispersant significantly (p<0.05) inhibited denitrification, but stimulated organic matter mineralization activities in the sediment due to unknown mechanisms. As a consequence, redox potentials (Eh) were much lower in the dispersant treated systems. The ecological impacts from the dispersant exposure may come from two fronts. First, loss of organic matter from the coastal marsh will threaten the long-term stability of the ecosystem, and the decrease in denitrification activity will weaken the N removal efficiency. Secondly, more reducing conditions developed by the dispersant exposure will likely preserve the oil in the ecosystem for an extended period of time due to weaker oil biodegradation under anaerobic conditions.

This is the first report on use of glyoxyl agarose and calcium alginate as matrixes for the immobilization of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase. Multipoint attachment of the enzyme to the carrier caused maintenance of its initial activity during the 21 days. Immobilization of dioxygenase in calcium alginate or on glyoxyl agarose resulted in decrease in the optimum temperature by 5 °C and 10 °C, respectively. Entrapment of the enzyme in alginate gel shifted its optimum pH towards high-alkaline pH while immobilization of the enzyme on glyoxyl agarose did not influence pH profile of the enzyme. Protocatechuate 3,4-dioygenase immobilized in calcium alginate showed increased activity towards 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate, caffeic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, and 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate. Slightly lower activity of the enzyme was observed after its immobilization on glyoxyl agarose. Entrapment of the enzyme in alginate gel protected it against chelators and aliphatic alcohols while its immobilization on glyoxyl agarose enhanced enzyme resistance to inactivation by metal ions.', 24736211: \"A fungal coculture system comprised of Coprinopsis cinerea Okayama 7 (#130) and Gongronella sp. w5 produced 900 times higher laccase activity than that in pure culture. A fungal laccase named Lcc9 was induced from C. cinerea for the first time by coculture. Lcc9 was purified, characterized, and found to have high activity toward phenolic substrates at the optimum pH of 6.5 and temperature of 60°C. The laccase was stable at alkaline pH values, and its activity was not significantly affected by cations and organic solvents.

A consortium of mixed bacteria (activated sludge) and microalgae was sequentially cultivated under photoautotrophic and photoheterotrophic modes. The hydrolysis of SCN(-) to ammonium (NH4(+))-nitrogen and subsequent nitrification steps were performed by the initial activated sludge under lithoautotrophic conditions. The NH4(+) and oxidized forms of nitrogen, nitrite (NO2(-)) and nitrate (NO3(-)), were then assimilated and removed by the microalgal cells when light was supplied. After the degradation of SCN(-), the cultivation mode was changed to photoheterotrophic conditions in a sequential manner. Algal-bacterial cultures containing Chlorella protothecoides and Ettlia sp. yielded significantly increased lipid productivity under photoheterotrophic conditions compared to photoautotrophic conditions (28.7- and 17.3-fold higher, respectively).

Then, morphological and molecular identification were examined. From the three wastewaters samples, Scenedesmus SDEC-8 showed good ability to yield oil and remove nutrients, which were comparable with other reports.

B. subtilis augmented system showed higher H2 production followed by L. fusiformis, P. stutzeri and control operations, indicating the efficacy of Firmicutes as bioaugmentation biocatalyst. Higher VFA production with acetic acid as a major fraction was specifically observed with B. subtilis augmented system. Shift in metabolic pathway towards acidogenesis favoured higher H2 production. FISH analysis confirmed survivability and persistence of augmented strains apart from improvement in process performance.

The nitrite degradation capacity of Lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus LCR 6013 was investigated in pickle fermentation. After LCR 6013 fermentation for 120 h at 37°C, the nitrite concentration in the fermentation system was significantly lower than that in the control sample without the LCR 6013 strain. The effects of NaCl and Vc on nitrite degradation by LCR 6013 in the De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) medium were also investigated. The highest nitrite degradations, 9.29 mg/L and 9.89 mg/L, were observed when NaCl and Vc concentrations were 0.75% and 0.02%, respectively in the MRS medium, which was significantly higher than the control group (p ≤ 0.01). Electron capture/gas chromatography and indophenol blue staining were used to study the nitrite degradation pathway of LCR 6013. The nitrite degradation products contained N2O, but no NH4(+). The LCR 6013 strain completely degraded all NaNO2 (50.00 mg/L) after 16 h of fermentation. The enzyme activity of NiR in the periplasmic space was 2.5 times of that in the cytoplasm. Our results demonstrated that L. casei subsp. rhamnosus LCR 6013 can effectively degrade nitrites in both the pickle fermentation system and in MRS medium by NiR. Nitrites are degraded by the LCR 6013 strain, likely via the nitrate respiration pathway (NO2(-)>NO->N2O->N2), rather than the aammonium formation pathway (dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, DNRA), because the degradation products contain N2O, but not NH4(+).', 24762759: 'The shift of microbial community under the adjustment of different pH was analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The results indicated, at initial pH 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, the copper extraction in 22 days amounted to 84.6%, 88.2% and 77.5%, respectively; however, when the initial pH was 2.0, processing pH was adjusted to 1.0 and 3.0 on day 16, the copper extraction in 32 days was 85% and 62.6%, respectively.

No significant effects were achieved in the BMP after thermochemical pre-treatment, although the seaweeds solubilisation increased up to 44%. Co-digestion with glycerol or sewage sludge has proved to be effective for increasing the methane production. Addition of 2% glycerol (w:w) increased the BMP by 18%, achieving almost complete methanation of the substrate (96±3%).

The investigation of the biodegradation of model substances (benzoic acid, acetic acid, glucose, sodium acetate) added to a standard soil showed no significant influence of the electrical heating methods when compared with samples heated to the same temperature in a water bath. Therefore, a hindrance of the microbial degradation could be excluded as it was done for soil respiration in a previous study. This finding is especially relevant for the application of these electrical heating methods for thermally enhanced soil bioremediation as an option for making in situ or ex situ clean-up processes more efficient.', 2478203: 'The hydrolytic degradation of poly(hydroxybutyrate)-poly(hydroxyvalerate) (PHB-PHV) copolymers in the form of blends with the polysaccharides amylose, dextran, dextrin and sodium alginate, has been studied under a range of conditions (pH 2.3, 7.4 and 10.6 and at 37 degrees C and 70 degrees C). The hydrolytic degradation of the PHB-PHV copolymers was found to be dramatically affected by the presence of polysaccharides. Its progress was characterized by an initial increase in the wet weight, with concurrent decrease in the dry weight as the polysaccharides eroded from the matrix. Surface energy measurements and goniophotometry proved to be particularly useful in monitoring this stage of the degradation process. The concurrent increase in internal porosity leads to the eventual collapse of the matrix, a process which occurs, but less rapidly, in the degradation of the unblended PHB-PHV copolymers.

No living organism, natural or engineered, is capable of the efficient aerobic utilization of this toxic industrial waste product. We describe a novel biotechnology for transforming TCP based on an immobilized synthetic pathway. The pathway is composed of three enzymes from two different microorganisms: engineered haloalkane dehalogenase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous NCIMB 13064, and haloalcohol dehalogenase and epoxide hydrolase from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1. Together, they catalyze consecutive reactions converting toxic TCP to harmless glycerol. The pathway was immobilized in the form of purified enzymes or cell-free extracts, and its performance was tested in batch and continuous systems. Using a packed bed reactor filled with the immobilized biocatalysts, 52.6 mmol of TCP was continuously converted into glycerol within 2.5 months of operation. The efficiency of the TCP conversion to the intermediates was 97%, and the efficiency of conversion to the final product glycerol was 78% during the operational period.

In this study, we aimed at identifying the rate-limiting factors for each redox condition, with special emphasis on phosphate as limiting nutrient. The study was conducted in laboratory microcosms assembled with material collected on site: sediments, water from monitoring wells, oil and microbial sludge. Redox conditions were promoted by adding electron acceptors (either oxygen, nitrate, limonite (FeO(OH)), cryptomelane (K(Mn(4+),Mn(2+))8O16), or sulfate). For each condition, the role of phosphate was studied by repeated additions for up to 290days. The results showed a very strong stimulation of aerobic and denitrifying rates of oil degradation by phosphate, provided that oxygen and nitrate were repeatedly supplied. Phosphate caused also a marked stimulation of methanogenic degradation, and a relatively small stimulation of metal reduction. These anaerobic processes started only after marked lag phases, and phosphate shortened the lag phase for methanogenic degradation. Degradation of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons with less than 8 carbons, including benzene, was confirmed even under unstimulated conditions. It is concluded that degradation rates at the site are limited by both, availability of electron acceptors and availability of phosphate needed for promoting microbial growth.

Substantial amounts of pentavalent organoarsenicals have been used as herbicides, such as monosodium methylarsonic acid (MSMA), and as growth enhancers for animal husbandry, such as roxarsone (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylarsonic acid) [Rox(V)]. These undergo environmental degradation to more toxic inorganic arsenite [As(III)]. We previously demonstrated a two-step pathway of degradation of MSMA to As(III) by microbial communities involving sequential reduction to methylarsonous acid [MAs(III)] by one bacterial species and demethylation from MAs(III) to As(III) by another. In this study, the gene responsible for MAs(III) demethylation was identified from an environmental MAs(III)-demethylating isolate, Bacillus sp. MD1. This gene, termed arsenic inducible gene (arsI), is in an arsenic resistance (ars) operon and encodes a nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenase with C ⋅ As lyase activity. Heterologous expression of ArsI conferred MAs(III)-demethylating activity and MAs(III) resistance to an arsenic-hypersensitive strain of Escherichia coli, demonstrating that MAs(III) demethylation is a detoxification process. Purified ArsI catalyzes Fe(2+)-dependent MAs(III) demethylation. In addition, ArsI cleaves the C ⋅ As bond in trivalent roxarsone and other aromatic arsenicals. ArsI homologs are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and we propose that ArsI-catalyzed organoarsenical degradation has a significant impact on the arsenic biogeocycle. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a molecular mechanism for organoarsenic degradation by a C ⋅ As lyase.', 24835915: 'A naphthalene-utilizing bacterium, Arthrobacter sp.

Both the growing and washed cells of strain W1 could degrade CA, DBF, DBT, and naphthalene simultaneously and quickly. Inhibition kinetics confirmed that the presence of CA, DBF and DBT in the growing system would inhibit the cells growth and biodegradability of strain W1. The relationship between ln(C/C0) and time, and specific degradation rate and CA, DBF and DBT concentration could be described well by First-order and Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The treatment of real coking wastewater containing high concentration of phenol, naphthalene, CA, DBF, DBT and NH3-N was shown to be highly efficient by naphthalene-grown W1 coupling with activation zeolite. Toxicity assessment indicated the treatment of the coking wastewater by strain W1 coupling with activation led to less toxicity than untreated wastewater.

Lower metal bioavailability often limits the phytoextraction. Organic chelators can help to improve this biological technique by increasing metal solubility. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possibility of improving the phytoextraction of Cd by the application of citric acid. For this purpose, plants were grown in hydroponics under controlled conditions. Results indicated that Cd supply significantly decreased the plant growth, biomass, pigments, photosynthetic characteristics and protein contents which were accompanied by a significant increase in Cd concentration, hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation and decrease in antioxidant capacity. The effects were dose dependent with obvious effects at higher Cd concentration. Application of CA significantly enhanced Cd uptake and its accumulation in plant roots, stems and leaves. Citric acid alleviated Cd toxicity by increasing plant biomass and photosynthetic and growth parameters alone and in combination with Cd and by reducing oxidative stress as observed by reduction in MDA and H₂O₂ production and decreased electrolyte leakage induced by Cd stress. Application of CA also enhanced the antioxidant enzymes activity alone and under Cd stress. Thus, the data indicate that exogenous CA application can increase Cd uptake and minimize Cd stress in plants and may be beneficial in accelerating the phytoextraction of Cd through hyper-accumulating plants such as Brassica napus L.', 24841574: 'Recently, anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass for methane production has attracted considerable attention. However, there is little information regarding methane production from asparagus stem, a typical lignocellulosic biomass, by anaerobic digestion. In this study, alkaline pretreatment of asparagus stem was investigated for its ability to increase hydrolysis rate and methane production and to improve biodegradability (BD). The hydrolysis rate increased with increasing NaOH dose, due to higher removal rates of lignin and hemicelluloses. However, the optimal NaOH dose was 6% (w/w) according to the specific methane production (SMP). Under this condition, the SMP and the technical digestion time of the NaOH-treated asparagus stem were 242.3 mL/g VS and 18 days, which were 38.4% higher and 51.4% shorter than those of the untreated sample, respectively. The BD was improved from 40.1% to 55.4%.

There was no pronounced membrane fouling at any salt concentration. O&G accumulation (less than 11% of the influent O&G) occurred in the mixed liquor at all salt concentrations, but biodegradation was identified as the major organic removal mechanism. With increasing salt concentration, initially increase in SVI and later formation of oil/biomass bodies took place but due to the presence of the membrane biomass washout did not occur.

Moreover, carbohydrate and protein content of their cells overtopped the other strains especially at higher concentrations. The algal strains were further subjected to grow under P-limitation in absence and presence of malathion. Although, the algal growth under P-limitation recorded a very poor level, a massive enhanced growth and phosphorous content of cells were obtained when the P-limited medium was amended with malathion.

Plant Pb uptake, accumulation, and detoxification mobilize Pb into food webs. Still, knowledge about the underlying mechanisms is very limited. This is largely due to serious experimental challenges with respect to Pb availability. In most studies, Pb(II) concentrations in the millimolar range have been used even though the toxicity threshold is in the nanomolar range. We therefore developed a low-phosphate, low-pH assay system that is more realistic with respect to soil solution conditions. In this system the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings was significantly affected by the addition of only 0.1 μM Pb(NO3)2. Involvement of phytochelatins in the detoxification of Pb(II) could be demonstrated by investigating phytochelatin synthase mutants. They showed a stronger inhibition of root growth and a lack of Pb-activated phytochelatin synthesis. In contrast, other putative Pb hypersensitive mutants were unaffected under these conditions, further supporting the essential role of phytochelatins for Pb detoxification. Our findings demonstrate the need to monitor plant Pb responses at realistic concentrations under controlled conditions and provide a strategy to achieve this.

The results indicated that both surfactants could modify the composition of fatty acids of Citrobacter sp. Strain SA01 cells, 50 mg L(-1) of both surfactants changed the composition of the fatty acids the most, increasing the amount of unsaturated fatty acids. The comparison of fatty acid profiles with diphenylhexatriene fluorescence anisotropy, a probe for plasma membrane fluidity, suggested that an increased amount of unsaturated fatty acids corresponded to greater membrane fluidity. In addition, increased unsaturated fatty acids promoted phenanthrene to partition from the extracellular matrix to cell debris, which increased reverse partitioning from the cell debris to the cytochylema.

The original soil showed impaired basic ecological functions due to the high availability of TEs, its acidic pH and high salinity. The three amendments slightly reduced the direct and indirect soil toxicity to plants, invertebrates and microorganisms as a consequence of the TEs' mobility decrease in topsoil, reducing therefore the soil associated risks. The organic amendments, especially compost, thanks to the supply of essential nutrients, were able to improve soil health, as they stimulated plant growth and significantly increased enzyme activities related with the key nutrients in soil. Therefore, the use of compost or pig slurry, in combination with hydrated lime, decreased soil ecotoxicity and seems to be a suitable management strategy for the remediation of highly acidic TEs contaminated soils. \", 24875879: 'A mesocosm experiment, in columns, was conducted in a growth chamber to assess the viability of two organic materials (pig slurry and compost; in combination with hydrated lime) for the remediation of a highly acidic and trace elements (TEs) contaminated mine soil and the reduction of its associated leaching risks.

Soluble and extractable concentrations of the different TEs were considerably high, although the organic amendments (with lime) and lime addition successfully decreased TEs mobility in the top soil layer, as a consequence of a rise in pH and changes in the redox conditions. Compost and pig slurry increased the soluble organic-C and dissolved N, K and P of the soil, producing a certain downwards displacement of N and K. The organic amendments allowed the growth of L. perenne in the soil, thus indicating improvement of soil conditions, but elevated TEs availability in the soil led to toxicity symptoms and abnormally high TEs concentrations in the plants.

Augmentation of the pre-grown mycelial biomass in the CEPT sludge had no significant changes in sludge pH but, improved sludge dewaterability, as evidenced from the decrease in capillary suction time. Improvement on sludge flocculation and dewaterability depended on the fungal strains, and a pellet forming Penicillium sp. was more effective than the fungal isolates producing filamentous form of mycelial biomass due to entrapment of sludge solids onto mycelial pellets. Fungal treatment also reduced the chemical oxygen demand of the CEPT sludge by 35-76%. Supplementation metal cations (Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and Fe(3+)) to fungal pre-augmented sludge rapidly improved the sludge dewaterability.

Growing evidence suggests that in syntrophic communities electron transfer does not rely exclusively on the exchange of diffusible molecules and energy carriers such as hydrogen or formate, rather microorganisms have the capability to exchange metabolic electrons in a more direct manner. Here, we show that supplementation of micrometer-size magnetite (Fe3O4) particles to a methanogenic sludge enhanced (up to 33%) the methane production rate from propionate, a key intermediate in the anaerobic digestion of organic matter and a model substrate to study energy-limited syntrophic communities. The stimulatory effect most probably resulted from the establishment of a direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET), based on magnetite particles serving as electron conduits between propionate-oxidizing acetogens and carbon dioxide-reducing methanogens. Theoretical calculations revealed that DIET allows electrons to be transferred among syntrophic partners at rates which are substantially higher than those attainable via interspecies H2 transfer. Besides the remarkable potential for improving anaerobic digestion, which is a proven biological strategy for renewable energy production, the herein described conduction-based DIET could also have a role in natural methane emissions from magnetite-rich soils and sediments.

Prior to the design of the fixed-bed bioreactor, the copper removal capacity by the live consortium and the effects of copper in the consortium biofilm formation were investigated. The Langmuir model indicated that the sorption capacity of the consortium for copper was 450.0 mg/g dry cells. The biosorption of copper into the microbial biomass was attributed to carboxyl and hydroxyl groups present in the microbial biomass. The effect of copper in planktonic cells to form biofilm under copper rich conditions was investigated with confocal microscopy. The results revealed that biofilm formed after 72 h exposure to copper presented a reduced thickness by 57% when compared to the control; however 84% of the total cells were still alive. The fixed-bed bioreactor was set up by growing the consortium biofilm on granular activated carbon (GAC) and analyzed for copper removal. The biofilm-GAC (BGAC) column retained 45% of the copper mass present in the influent, as opposed to 17% in the control column that contained GAC only. These findings suggest that native microbial communities in sites contaminated with heavy metals can be immobilized in fixed-bed bioreactors and used to treat metal contaminated water.', 24980029: 'The removal of four recalcitrant trace organic contaminants (TrOCs), namely carbamazepine, diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and atrazine by laccase in an enzymatic membrane reactor (EMR) was studied.

Addition of the redox-mediator syringaldehyde (SA) to the EMR resulted in a notable dose-dependent improvement (15-45%) of TrOC removal affected by inherent TrOC properties and loading rates. However, SA addition resulted in a concomitant increase in the toxicity of the treated effluent. A further 14-25% improvement in aqueous phase removal of the TrOCs was consistently observed following a one-off dosing of 3g/L granular activated carbon (GAC).

The application of all organic amendments increased the soil pH while inorganic amendments such as single superphosphate did not. Both inorganic and organic amendments decreased the availability and uptake of Pb while the organic amendments were superior to the inorganic (phosphate) amendments in reducing the availability of the more labile (soluble and exchangeable Pb) forms of soil Pb. More Pb was taken up by roots than shoots with all soil amendments. Among the organic amendments, straw manure and pig manure caused the largest decrease in Pb availability at 456.5 and 457.3 mg kg(-1), respectively, when a high level of 30 g organic amendments kg(-1) was applied. The organic amendments greatly increased the fraction D targeted to Fe-Mn oxides bound Pb, and decreased the fraction A (water-soluble), B (exchangeable), and C (carbonate-bound), thereby decreasing the solubility and mobility of Pb in soil. The organic amendments also significantly improved the concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu and Zn in the soil and shoots (except Fe in shoots and/or roots), which are essential for plant nutrition. The organic amendments of straw and pig manure lowered the availability and uptake of Pb but not that of other trace metals.

Complete biotransformation was observed only for IBP and KTP, although, an inverse correlation between transformation rate and concentration was found. The transformation pattern observed is consistent with ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) activity. The metabolic succession of the compounds according to the biotransformation rates was: IBP>KTP>DXM>CBZ>IOP. A linear correlation between the calculated diffusive flux of the model compounds across a bilayer membrane and their biotransformation rates was found. Our results support the concept that augmentation with nitrifying activity can enhance the removal of trace organic pollutants during effluent treatment.

The strain IITR03 was identified as a member of the genus Rhodococcus based on polyphasic studies. Under aqueous culture conditions, the strain IITR03 degraded 282 μM of DDT and could also utilize 10mM concentration each of 4-chlorobenzoic acid, 3-chlorobenzoic acid and benzoic acid as sole carbon and energy source. The catechol 1,2-dioxygenase enzyme activity resulted in conversion of catechol to form cis,cis-muconic acid. Cloning and sequencing of partial nucleotide sequence of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase gene (cat) from strain IITR03 revealed its similarity to catA gene present in Rhodococcus sp. strain Lin-2 (97% identity) and Rhodococcus strain AN22 (96% identity) degrading benzoate and aniline, respectively. The results suggest that the strain IITR03 could be useful for field bioremediation studies of DDT-residues and chlorinated aromatic compounds present in contaminated sites.', 25006021: 'To give reference for the application of heterotrophic nitrification-aerobic denitrification bacteria in actual wastewater treatment, the impact resistance of extreme pH, low temperature, heavy metals and high salinity on ammonia removal by a typical heterotrophic nitrifying-aerobic denitrifying bacterium Aeromonas sp. HN-02 was investigated. The results showed that HN-02 demonstrated strong acid- and alkali-resistance. In addition, it remained active at 5°C, and the removal rates of ammonia and COD were 0.90 mg L(-1)h(-1) and 22.34 mg L(-1)h(-1), respectively. Under the same extent of immediate temperature drop, the temperature correction coefficients of ammonia, COD removal rates and cell growth rate were close. Moreover, HN-02 could survive in the solution containing 0.5 mg L(-1) Cu(2+) or 8 mg L(-1) Zn(2+), or 0.5 mg L(-1) of equivalent Cu(2+)-Zn(2+). Furthermore, efficient ammonia removal was retained at salinity below 20 g L(-1), thus it could be identified as a halotolerant bacterium.

All algal strains grew in all wastewater mixtures; however, Selenastrum minutum had the highest biomass and lipids yields, up to 37% of the dry matter. Nitrogen and phosphorus removal were high and followed a similar trend in all three strains. Ammonium was reduced from 96% to 99%; this reduction was due to algal growth and not to stripping to the atmosphere, as confirmed by the amount of nitrogen in the dry algal biomass. Phosphate was reduced from 91% to 99%. In all strains used the lipid content was negatively correlated to the nitrogen concentration in the algal biomass. Mixtures of pulp and paper wastewater with municipal and dairy wastewater have great potential to grow algae for biomass and lipid production together with effective wastewater treatment.

Glycine betaine (GB) was the most effective in alleviating salt toxicity, although all the compatible solutes (GB, trehalose and ectoine) were found to be valid. Acclimation potential of anammox biomass under salinity of 30 g/L increased significantly with GB addition. The recovery time in the reactor with GB addition (RB) (49 days) accompanied by a more stable stoichiometric ratio was 2.65 times shorter than in the control reactor (RC) (130 days).

In a steady-state, the average removal efficiencies of NH4(+)-N, total nitrogen (TN) and COD were 99.7 ± 0.1%, 98.3 ± 0.3% and 89.8 ± 1.4%, when influent NH4(+)-N, TN and COD were 1025-1327 mg/L, 1346-1854 mg/L and 6430-9372 mg/L, respectively. In the anaerobic stage, dissolved organic matter was taken up partially and stored as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) with concomitant consumption of glycogen. In the aerobic stage, PHAs was oxidized and glycogen was replenished in the bacterial cells, when TN of 75.4 mg/L was removed via simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND). The residual nitrate and nitrite were denitrified completely by utilizing residual PHAs and glycogen as electron donors in the anoxic phase.

One approach is to use enzymes such as laccase for the degradation of micropollutants such as bisphenol-A. In this work, laccase was covalently immobilized on APTES modified TiO2 nanoparticles, and the effects of particle modification on the bio-catalytic performance were examined and optimized. These bio-catalytic particles were then suspended in a hybrid membrane reactor for BPA removal with good BPA degradation efficiency observed. Substantial improvement in laccase stability was achieved in the hybrid system compared with free laccase under simulated harsh industrial wastewater treatment conditions (such as a wide range of pH and presence of inhibitors).

Bacterial strains isolated from contaminated soil from Klatovy-Luby, Hajek and Neratovice, Czech Republic, capable of growth on the selected pesticides were isolated and characterised. These isolates were subjected to characterisation and identification by MS MALDI-TOF of whole cells and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA genes. The isolates were screened by gas chromatography for their ability to degrade the selected pesticides. Some isolates were able to degrade pesticides, and the formation of degradation products (γ-pentachlorocyclohexane (γ-PCCH), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD)) observed in liquid culture confirmed their degradation capability. The isolates and DNA samples isolated from the contaminated soil were also screened for the bphA1 gene (encoding biphenyl-2,3-dioxygenase, the first enzyme in the PCB degradation pathway) and its occurrence was demonstrated. The isolates were also screened for the presence of linA, encoding dehydrochlorinase, the first enzyme of the HCH degradation pathway. The linA gene could not be found in any of the tested isolates, possibly due to the high specificity of the primers used. The isolates with the most effective degradation abilities could be used for further in situ bioremediation experiments with contaminated soil.

PH-08. NP (0-1,000 mg L(-1)) -treated bacterial cells were assessed for cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, growth and biodegradation activities at biochemical and molecular levels. In an aqueous system, the bacterial cells treated with nAl, nZn and nNi at 500 mg L(-1) showed significant reduction in cell viability (30-93.6 %, p < 0.05), while nFe had no significant inhibition on bacterial cell viability. In the presence of nAl, nZn and nNi, the cells exhibited elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and cell death. Furthermore, NP exposure showed significant (p < 0.05) impairment in DF and catechol biodegradation activities. The reduction in DF biodegradation was ranged about 71.7-91.6 % with single NPs treatments while reached up to 96.3 % with a mixture of NPs. Molecular and biochemical investigations also clearly revealed that NP exposure drastically affected the catechol-2,3-dioxygenase activities and its gene (c23o) expression. However, no significant inhibition was observed in nFe treatment. The bacterial extracellular polymeric materials and by-products from DF degradation can be assumed as key factors in diminishing the toxic effects of NPs, especially for nFe. This study clearly demonstrates the impact of single and mixed NPs on the microbial catabolism of xenobiotic-degrading bacteria at biochemical and molecular levels. This is the first study on estimating the impact of mixed NPs on microbial biodegradation.', 25103037: 'Intensified nutrient removal and odor control in a novel electrolysis-integrated tidal flow constructed wetland were evaluated. The average removal efficiencies of COD and NH4(+)-N were above 85% and 80% in the two experimental wetlands at influent COD concentration of 300 mg/L and ammonium nitrogen concentration of 60 mg/L regardless of electrolysis integration. Effluent nitrate concentration decreased from 2.5mg/L to 0.5mg/L with the reduction in current intensity from 1.5 mA/cm(2) to 0.57 mA/cm(2). This result reveals the important role of current intensity in nitrogen transformation. Owing to the ferrous and ferric iron coagulant formed through the electro-dissolution of the iron anode, electrolysis integration not only exerted a positive effect on phosphorus removal but also effectively inhibited sulfide accumulation for odor control. Although electrolysis operation enhanced nutrient removal and promoted the emission of CH4, no significant difference was observed in the microbial communities and abundance of the two experimental wetlands.', 25103550: \"There is a growing trend to employ agricultural waste/by-products (AWBs) as the substrates for the development of phosphate biosorbents. Nevertheless, due to the lack of anion binding sites, natural AWBs are usually inefficient in phosphate decontamination. Consequently, modification plays a vital role in improving phosphate sorption's property of raw AWBs. This review paper evaluates all existing methods of modification. The literatures indicate that modification can significantly improve phosphate removal ability of AWBs by retaining phosphate ion onto modified AWBs principally via ion exchange (electrostatic interaction) and ligand exchange mechanisms. So far, little work has been done on the beneficial use of modified AWBs for the phosphorus recovery from aqueous solutions. The poor recyclability of modified AWBs could be responsible for their limited application. Hence, further study is essential to search for novel, cost-effective, and green methods of modification. \", 25105531: \"NOx, a significant portion of fossil fuel flue gases, are among the most serious environmental issues in the world and must be removed in an additional costly gas treatment step. This study evaluated the growth of the green alga Chlorella sp. C2 under a nitrite-simulated NOx environment and the removal rates of actual flue gas fixed salts (FGFSs) from Sinopec's Shijiazhuang refinery along with lipid production. The results showed that nitrite levels lower than 176.5 mM had no significant adverse effects on the cell growth and photosynthesis of Chlorella sp. C2, demonstrating that this green alga could utilize nitrite and NOx as a nitrogen source. High concentrations of nitrite (88.25-176.5 mM) also resulted in the accumulation of neutral lipids. A 60% nitrite removal efficiency was obtained together with the production of 33% algae lipids when cultured with FGFS. Notably, the presence of nitrate in the FGFS medium significantly enhanced the nitrite removal capability, biomass and lipid production. Thus, this study may provide a new insight into the economically viable application of microalgae in the synergistic combination of biological DeNOx of industrial flue gases and biodiesel production. \", 25122054: 'Even though arsenic is one of the most widespread environmental carcinogens, methods of remediation are still limited. In this report we demonstrate that a strain of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 endowed with chromosomal expression of the arsM gene encoding the As(III) S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) methyltransfase from Rhodopseudomonas palustris to remove arsenic from contaminated soil. We genetically engineered the P. putida KT2440 with stable expression of an arsM-gfp fusion gene (GE P. putida), which was inserted into the bacterial chromosome. GE P. putida showed high arsenic methylation and volatilization activity. When exposed to 25 μM arsenite or arsenate overnight, most inorganic arsenic was methylated to the less toxic methylated arsenicals methylarsenate (MAs(V)), dimethylarsenate (DMAs(V)) and trimethylarsine oxide (TMAs(V)O). Of total added arsenic, the species were about 62 ± 2.2% DMAs(V), 25 ± 1.4% MAs(V) and 10 ± 1.2% TMAs(V)O. Volatilized arsenicals were trapped, and the predominant species were dimethylarsine (Me2AsH) (21 ± 1.0%) and trimethylarsine (TMAs(III)) (10 ± 1.2%). At later times, more DMAs(V) and volatile species were produced. Volatilization of Me2AsH and TMAs(III) from contaminated soil is thus possible with this genetically engineered bacterium and could be instrumental as an agent for reducing the inorganic arsenic content of soil and agricultural products.

Upon exposure, graphene/rGO and GO exhibit different adsorption properties toward environmental adsorbates, thus the molecular interactions at the GFN-water interface are discussed. After solute adsorption, the dispersion/aggregation behaviors of GFNs can be altered by solution chemistry, as well as by the presence of colloidal particles and biocolloids. GO has different dispersion performance from pristine graphene and rGO, which is further demonstrated from surface properties. Upon exposure in aquatic environments, GFNs have adverse impacts on aquatic organisms (e.g., bacteria, algae, plants, invertebrates, and fish). The mechanisms of GFNs toxicity at the cellular level are reviewed and the remaining unclear points on toxic mechanisms such as membrane damage are presented. Moreover, we highlight the transformation routes of GO to rGO. The degradation of GFNs upon exposure to UV irradiation and/or biota is also reviewed. In view of the unanswered questions, future research should include comprehensive characterization of GFNs, new approaches for explaining GFNs aggregation, environmental behaviors of metastable GO, and the relationship between dispersion of GFNs and the related adsorption properties.

Rehabilitation of spent mine sites through revegetation thus requires proper soil amendments. In this study, a pot trial was conducted to investigate the effects of a jarrah biochar on the growth and nutrient status of a native legume, Acacia tetragonophylla, grown in a mixture of topsoil and mine rejects. Two biochar application rates (37 and 74 t ha(-1)) and two types of biochar, namely nutrient-enriched and non-enriched, were tested. We measured the soil pH and electrical conductivity, the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents and C and N isotope composition (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) of soil and plants, the foliar phosphorus content and the growth and leaf biomass of the plants. Whilst no significant effect of biochar was observed on plant growth, biochar amendment affected soil properties and plant nutritional status. The highest rate of biochar application increased soil pH, C content and C/N ratio, and decreased soil δ(13)C. Biochar application also enhanced photosynthetic N use efficiency, as showed by the increase in foliar C/N ratio, and biological N fixation rates, as indicated by foliar δ(15)N. These positive effects were not observed when biochar was nutrient-enriched due to the associated increase in soil N. Revegetation of mine sites with acacia in combination with biochar amendment constitutes a plausible alternative to the wide use of N fertiliser through the supply of additional N to the system, even though other nutrients may be required in order to enhance plant early growth.', 25203592: 'Here we report on the growth, accumulation performances of, and leaf proteomic changes in Eucalyptus camaldulensis plants harvested for different periods of time in an industrial, heavy metals (HMs)-contaminated site in the presence or absence of soil microorganism (AMs/PGPRs) additives. Data were compared to those of control counterparts grown in a neighboring nonpolluted district. Plants harvested in the contaminated areas grew well and accumulated HMs in their leaves. The addition of AMs/PGPRs to the polluted soil determined plant growth and metal accumulation performances that surpassed those observed in the control. Comparative proteomics suggested molecular mechanisms underlying plant adaptation to the HMs challenge. Similarly to what was observed in laboratory-scale investigations on other metal hyperaccumulators but not on HMs-sensitive plants, eucalyptus grown in the contaminated areas showed an over-representation of enzymes involved in photosynthesis and the Calvin cycle. AMs/PGPRs addition to the soil increased the activation of these energetic pathways, suggesting the existence of signaling mechanisms that address the energy/reductive power requirement associated with augmented growth performances. HMs-exposed plants presented an over-representation of antioxidant enzymes, chaperones, and proteins involved in glutathione metabolism. While some antioxidant enzymes/chaperones returned to almost normal expression values in the presence of AMs/PGPRs or in plants exposed to HMs for prolonged periods, proteins guaranteeing elevated glutathione levels were constantly over-represented. These data suggest that glutathione (and related phytochelatins) could act as key molecules for ensuring the effective formation of HMs-chelating complexes that are possibly responsible for the observed plant tolerance to metal stresses.

This study reports the characterization of an olive (Olea europaea L. cv. Ayvalik) metallothionein with respect to molecular and functional properties. A cDNA encoding a type 2 metallothionein from olive was isolated from a leaf cDNA library, characterized and named OeMT2 after its molecular and functional properties. OeMT2 was expressed in Escherichia coli, and a single protein band was confirmed by protein gel blot analysis. Metal tolerance ability of bacterial cells expressing OeMT2 was determined against 0.2\\xa0mM CdCl2, 0.4\\xa0mM CdCl2 and 1\\xa0mM CuSO4 in the growth medium. Metal ion contents of bacterial cells expressing OeMT2 were measured by ICP. Metal tolerance assays and ICP measurements suggested that OeMT2 effectively binds Cu and Cd. Molecular analysis of OeMT2 revealed two introns, three exons, a short 3' UTR and a long 5' UTR. Comparing the genomic sequences from 14 olive cultivars revealed OeMT2 had both intron and exon polymorphisms dividing the cultivars into three groups. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that OeMT2 expresses more or less the same amounts in all tissues of the olive tree examined. The genomic copy number of OeMT2 was also determined employing real-time PCR which suggested a single copy gene in the olive genome while three other MT2 members were determined from the draft olive genome sequences of Ayvalik cultivar and that of wild olive. This is the first report on molecular and functional characterization of an olive metallothionein and shows that OeMT2 expressed in E. coli has the capability of effectively binding toxic heavy metals. This may suggest that OeMT2 plays an important role in metal homeostasis in addition to a good potential for environmental and industrial usage. \", 25216123: 'Fe3O4 poly (styrene-glycidyl methacrylate) magnetic porous microspheres (MPPMs) were introduced to immobilize Klebsiella sp.

S(2-) reacted with Fe(III)EDTA as an electron-shuttling compound and enhanced the reduction. But Fe(III)EDTA reduction was inhibited by SO3(2-) and Fe(II)EDTA-NO due to their toxic to microorganisms. Low concentrations of NO3(-) and NO2(-) accelerated Fe(III)EDTA reduction, but high concentrations inhibited the reduction, whether by free or immobilized FD-3. The immobilized FD-3 performed better than freely-suspended style. The substrate mass transfer and diffusion kinetics in the porous microspheres were calculated. The value of Thiele modulus and effectiveness factors showed that the intraparticle diffusion was fairly small and neglected in this carrier.

The four Pseudomonas lipopeptides yielded emulsification indices on hexadecane of 20-31% at 90 mg/l, which is comparable to values for the synthetic surfactant Tween 80. Viscosin was the optimal emulsifier and significantly stimulated n-hexadecane mineralization by diesel-degrading bacterial consortia but exclusively during the first 2 days of batch culture experiments. Growth of the consortia, as determined by OD₆₀₀ measurements and quantification of the alkB marker gene for alkane degradation, was arrested after the first day of the experiment. In contrast, the control consortia continued to grow and reached higher OD₆₀₀ values and higher alkB copy numbers during the next days. Due to the short-lived stimulation of n-hexadecane mineralization, the stability of viscosin was analyzed, and it was observed that added viscosin was degraded by the bacterial consortium during the first 2 days. Hence, viscosin has a potential as stimulator of alkane degradation, but its utility in bioremediation may be limited by its rapid degradation and growth-inhibiting properties.', 25218258: 'Bioremediation is a potentially cost-effective solution for petroleum contamination in cold region sites. This study investigates the extent of biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons (C16-C34) in a pilot-scale biopile experiment conducted at 15°C for periods up to 385 days, with a clayey soil, from a crude oil-impacted site in northern Canada. Although several studies on bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated soils from cold region sites have been reported for coarse-textured, sandy soils, there are limited studies of bioremediation of petroleum contamination in fine-textured, clayey soils. Our results indicate that aeration and moisture addition was sufficient for achieving 47% biodegradation and an endpoint of 530 mg/kg for non-volatile (C16-C34) petroleum hydrocarbons. Nutrient amendment with 95 mg-N/kg showed no significant effect on biodegradation compared to a control system without nutrient but similar moisture content. In contrast, in a biopile amended with 1340 mg-N/kg, no statistically significant biodegradation of non-volatile fraction was detected. Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses of alkB and 16S rRNA genes revealed that inhibition of hydrocarbon biodegradation was associated with a lack of change in microbial community composition. Overall, our data suggests that biopiles are feasible for attaining the bioremediation endpoint in clayey soils.

Fertilization with NaNO3 alone or together with a mixture of the vitamins thiamine, pyridoxine, vitamin B12, biotin, riboflavin, and folic acid increased the hydrocarbon-removal values, to reach 90 %. Biofouling material samples harbored total bacteria in the magnitude of 10(7) cells g(-1), about 25 % of which were hydrocarbonoclastic. These numbers were enhanced by NaNO3 and vitamin amendment.

Most of those bacteria are hydrocarbonoclastic. Culture-dependent analysis of hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria revealed that Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus, Dietzia maris, and Gordonia bronchialis predominated in the fouling materials. In addition, each material had several more-specific hydrocarbonoclastic species, whose frequencies were enhanced by NaNO3 and vitamin fertilization. The same samples of fouling materials were used in four successive crude-oil-removal cycles without any dramatic loss of their hydrocarbon-removal potential nor of their associated hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria.

As in bacteria, all four genes of the naphthalene dioxygenase system can be simultaneously expressed and assembled to an active enzyme in transgenic plants. The naphthalene dioxygenase system can develop the capacity of plants to tolerate a high concentration of phenanthrene and metabolize phenanthrene in vivo. As a result, transgenic plants showed improved uptake of phenanthrene from the environment over wild-type plants. In addition, phenanthrene concentrations in shoots and roots of transgenic plants were generally lower than that of wild type plants.

The natural soil organic matter content (SOM) and the present of Brij 35, both above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and below the CMC, changed the rate of PHE biodegradation in the presence of Brij 35. PHE biodegradation is different in the two different soil/water systems: PHE > PHE-Brij 35-Micelle > PHE-Brij 35-Monomer in the clay/water system; PHE-Brij 35-Micelle > PHE-Brij 35-Monomer > PHE in the natural soil/water system. Among the free-living species associated with PHE-Brij 35 biodegradation, Brevundimonas diminuta, Caulobacter spp., Mycoplana bullata, Acidovorax spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for 90.72% to 99.90% of the bacteria present. Specific hydrolytic enzymes, including esterases, glycosol-hydrolases and phosphatases, are expressed during PHE biodegradation. The information presented here will help the engineering design of more effective PAH bioremediation systems that use Brij 35 series flushing technology. In particular, micelles of Brij 35 can be used to accelerate the rate of remediation of PAH-contaminated soil in natural soil/water systems.

In this study the mutagenic/genotoxic effects of Al were evaluated in roots and leaves of two Plantago, species, Plantago almogravensis and Plantago lagopus, using ISSRs markers. Both species were exposed to 400 μM Al during 7 and 21 days. Ten ISSR primers produced polymorphic bands. In P. almogravensis, a total of 257 and 258 bands in roots and 255 and 265 bands in leaves were produced in the presence and absence of Al, respectively. In P. lagopus were produced 279 and 278 a total bands in roots and 275 and 274 bands in leaves, under the same conditions. The changes in ISSR profiles after Al treatment were considered as gain and/or loss of bands compared with the controls. The results suggest that changes in genomic template stability (GTS) could be detected with ISSR profiles. This molecular marker proved to be a good tool to detect the effects of Al on DNA profiles. It seems that Al did not interfere significantly with DNA integrity in both species but generated less ISSR stability in P. almogravensis than in P. lagopus. The results confirm the tolerance of P. almogravensis and suggest the same behavior of P. lagopus. Although further studies are required for confirmation the Al tolerance behavior of P. lagopus, a potential application for phytoremediation can be also considered due its wide distribution.\", 25354896: 'Animal waste from concentrated swine farms is widely considered to be a source of environmental pollution, and the introduction of veterinary antibiotics in animal manure to ecosystems is rapidly becoming a major public health concern. A housefly larvae (Musca domestica) vermireactor has been increasingly adopted for swine manure value-added bioconversion and pollution control, but few studies have investigated its efficiency on antibiotic attenuation during manure vermicomposting. In this study we explored the capacity and related attenuation mechanisms of antibiotic degradation and its linkage with waste reduction by field sampling during a typical cycle (6 days) of full-scale larvae manure vermicomposting. Nine antibiotics were dramatically removed during the 6-day vermicomposting process, including tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and fluoroquinolones. Of these, oxytetracycline and ciprofloxacin exhibited the greater reduction rate of 23.8 and 32.9 mg m(-2), respectively. Environmental temperature, pH, and total phosphorus were negatively linked to the level of residual antibiotics, while organic matter, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, microbial respiration intensity, and moisture exhibited a positive effect. Pyrosequencing data revealed that the dominant phyla related to Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria accelerated manure biodegradation likely through enzyme catalytic reactions, which may enhance antibiotic attenuation during vermicomposting.', 25380640: 'Prevalence of heavy metals in the living environment causes chemical stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation in Phanerochaete chrysosporium (P. chrysosporium). However, the mechanisms involved in ROS defense are still under investigation. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of lead- and cadmium-induced oxidative stress on the activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), lignin peroxidase (LiP), and manganese peroxidase (MnP). A time-dependent change in all enzyme activities was observed following exposure to 50 μM cadmium and 25 μM lead. The lowest values were recorded at 4 h after exposure. Both cadmium and lead inhibited CAT and POD. The cytochrome P450 (CYP450) levels increased under 50-100 μM cadmium or lead exposure and decreased when heavy metal concentration was under 50 μM; this suggested that ROS is not the only factor that alters the CYP450 levels. The cadmium removal rate in the sample containing 900 μM taxifolin (inhibitor of CYP450) and 100 μM cadmium was reduced to 12.34 %, 9.73 % lower than that of 100 μM cadmium-induced sample, indicating CYP450 may play an indirect but key role in the process of clearance of heavy metals.

The aim of our study was to determine the utilization of the chosen, structurally diverse aminophosphonates by Aspergillus terreus (Thom), in the context of the behaviour of this fungus while growing in unfavourable conditions, namely the lack of easily available phosphates. We found that all the studied compounds were utilized by fungus as nutritive sources of phosphorus, however, their effect on the production of fungal biomass depended on their structure. We also observed an interesting change in the metabolism of A. terreus; namely the overproduction of 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-DTBP), which is known to possess fungistatic activity. In the case of our study, the biosynthesis of this compound was induced by phosphorus starvation, caused either by the lack of that element in the medium, or the poor degradation of phosphonate.

Oxo-biodegradable polymers contain pro-oxidants that accelerate their physical and biological degradation. These polymers were developed to decrease the accumulation of plastic waste in landfills. To study the degradation of the plastic polymers, oxo-biodegradable plastic bags were exposed to sunlight for up to 120 days, and fragments of these bags were used as substrates for P. ostreatus. We observed that physical treatment alone was not sufficient to initiate degradation. Instead, mechanical modifications and reduced titanium oxide (TiO2) concentrations caused by sunlight exposure triggered microbial degradation. The low specificity of lignocellulolytic enzymes and presence of endomycotic nitrogen-fixing microorganisms were also contributing factors in this process.

After the treatment, a small amount of calcium sulfate dihydrate (CSD) forms on the surface; the porosity near the surface region decreases, consequently enhancing tablet strength and surface hardness. Because of the decrease in porosity at the surface, the time for complete disintegration increases from 1.2 h to 7.2 h; the time for complete dissolution increases from 7 days to 25 days.', 25459834: 'Effects of composting on the fate of sulfonamides (SAs) in the manure-straw mixture were explored through a simulation of aerobic composting process. Additionally, factors of temperature and coexistence of heavy metal Cu that might influence the removal efficiency were particularly investigated. As shown in the results, the extractable SAs dissipated rapidly during the composting process. The coexistence of Cu in the composting process might have delayed the decline of SAs, but the drugs could still be completely removed by the end of the composting. In contrast to the thermophilic aerobic composting, extractable SAs in air-temperature-placed mixture dissipated much slower and 1.12-1.56mg/kg could be detected after 35days of incubation. The results confirmed that temperature could influence the dissipation of SAs, which was identified as a more important factor than Cu-coexistence. Hence, thermophilic aerobic composting is an effective process to eliminate VAs before manure land application.

Phosphate uptake rate was determined in eighteen laboratory batch experiments, with samples taken from a progressively more P-starved culture in which a minimum P content of 0.11% (w/w) was achieved. The results obtained showed that the higher the internal biomass P content, the lower the phosphate removal rate. The highest specific phosphate removal rate was 6.5mgPO4-PgTSS(-1)h(-1). Microalgae with a P content around 1% (w/w) attained 10% of this highest removal rate, whereas those with a P content of 0.6% (w/w) presented 50% of the maximum removal rate. Different kinetic expressions were used to reproduce the experimental data. Best simulation results for the phosphate uptake process were obtained combining Steele equation and Hill function to represent the effect of light and intracellular phosphorus content, respectively.

The results show that although ammonium and phosphate were well removed in the tested nitrogen concentration range (20-50 mg L(-1)), granule size, the amount of phosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) and microbial activity were affected significantly. A possible mechanism for the effect of influent nitrogen concentration on granule size is proposed based on the experimental results. The increase in proteins/polysaccharides ratio caused by high influent nitrogen concentration plays a crucial role in granule breakage. The small granule size then weakens simultaneous nitrification-denitrification, which further causes higher nitrate concentration in the effluent and lower amount of PAOs in sludge. Consequently, phosphate concentration in the anaerobic phase decreases, which plays the secondary role in granule breakage.', 25496943: 'High ammonia concentration in anaerobic reactors can seriously inhibit the anaerobic digestion process. In this study, a submersible microbial desalination cell (SMDC) was developed as an innovative method to lower the ammonia level in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) by in situ ammonia recovery and electricity production. In batch experiment, the ammonia concentration in the CSTR decreased from 6 to 0.7 g-N/L during 30 days, resulting in an average recovery rate of 80 g-N/m(2)/d. Meanwhile, a maximum power density of 0.71±0.5 W/m(2) was generated at 2.85 A/m(2). Both current driven NH4(+) migration and free NH3 diffusion were identified as the mechanisms responsible for the ammonia transportation. With an increase in initial ammonia concentration and a decrease in external resistance, the SMDC performance was enhanced. In addition, the coexistence of other cations in CSTR or cathode had no negative effect on the ammonia transportation.', 25496950: 'The present study isolated microalgae with tolerance to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) from wastewater aiming to discover isolates with high removal abilities. Nine isolates, Chlorella (STCh and SICh), Parachlorella (STPa1 and STPa2), Scenedesmus (STSc, TPSc1 and TPSc2), Nitzschia palea (YLBa) and Mychonastes (TPMy), were obtained. Four isolates, SICh, STCh, STPa1 and TPSc1, were very tolerant, and their growth was not affected by DE-71 and BDE-209 mixtures (5:1) at low (6 μg L(-1)), medium (60 μg L(-1)) or even high (600 μg L(-1)) levels for 7 days. The removal of PBDEs by one of the tolerant isolates, SICh, was the highest, with 82-90% removal at the end of 7-days exposure. SICh also accumulated more PBDEs than the other isolates.

Both in mineral salt medium and in soil, more than 97% of added ferulic acid was degraded within 48 h. The metabolites were identified and quantified using GC-MS and HPLC-MS. Ferulic acid was first decarboxylated to 4-vinyl guaiacol and then oxidized to vanillin and vanillic acid, followed by demethylation to protocatechuic acid, which was further degraded through the β-ketoadipate pathway. During degradation, ferulic acid decarboxylase, laccase and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase activities and their gene transcription levels were significantly affected by the variation of substrate and product concentrations. Moreover, ferulic acid degradation was determined to some extent by P. liquidambari laccase.

Radiotracer studies with [14C]PCE indicated that [14C]ethylene was the terminal product; significant conversion to 14CO2 or 14CH4 was not observed. The rate-limiting step in the pathway appeared to be conversion of vinyl chloride to ethylene. To sustain reductive dechlorination of PCE and TCE, it was necessary to supply an electron donor; methanol was the most effective, although hydrogen, formate, acetate, and glucose also served.

Ozone reacted preferentially with NAs of higher cyclicity and molecular weight and decreased both cyclicity and the acute Microtox® toxicity by 3.3-fold. The ozone reactivity with acyclic and monocyclic model NAs varied and depended on other structural features, such as branching and the presence of tertiary or quaternary carbons. Batch aerobic degradation of unozonated NA mixture using a NA-enriched culture resulted in 83% NA removal and a 6.7-fold decrease in toxicity, whereas a combination of ozonation-biodegradation resulted in 89% NA removal and a 15-fold decrease in toxicity.

In such soils, the microbial community is well adapted to the pollution, but the microbial activity is limited by nutrient availability. Management strategies could be applied to modify the soil microbial functioning as well as the PAH contamination through various amendment types. The impact of amendment with clay minerals (montmorillonite), wood sawdust and organic matter plant roots on microbial community structure was investigated on two aged PAH-contaminated soils both in laboratory and 1-year on-site pot experiments. Total PAH content (sum of 16 PAHs of the US-EPA list) and polar polycyclic aromatic compounds (pPAC) were monitored as well as the available PAH fraction using the Tenax method. The bacterial and fungal community structures were monitored using fingerprinting thermal gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) method. The abundance of bacteria (16S rRNA genes), fungi (18S rRNA genes) and PAH degraders (PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase and catechol dioxygenase genes) was followed through qPCR assays. Although the treatments did not modify the total and available PAH content, the microbial community density, structure and the PAH degradation potential changed when fresh organic matter was provided as sawdust and under rhizosphere influence, while the clay mineral only increased the percentage of catechol-1,2-dioxygenase genes. The abundance of bacteria and fungi and the percentage of fungi relative to bacteria were enhanced in soil samples supplemented with wood sawdust and in the plant rhizospheric soils. Two distinct fungal populations developed in the two soils supplemented with sawdust, i.e. fungi related to Chaetomium and Neurospora genera and Brachyconidiellopsis and Pseudallescheria genera, in H and NM soils respectively. Wood sawdust amendment favoured the development of PAH-degrading bacteria holding Gram-negative PAH-ring hydroxylating dioxygenase, catechol-1,2-dioxygenase and catechol-2,3-dioxygenase genes. Regarding the total community structure, bacteria closely related to Thiobacillus (β-Proteobacteria) and Steroidobacter (γ-Proteobacteria) genera were favoured by wood sawdust amendment.

However, little is known regarding the effects of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the biodegradation and persistence of organic contaminants in water. We investigated the impacts of pristine and oxidized multiwalled CNTs on the atrazine biodegradation rate and efficiency using Arthrobacter sp. At a concentration of 25mg/L, the CNTs enhanced the biodegradation rate by up to 20%; however, at a concentration of 100mg/L, the CNTs decreased the biodegradation rate by up to 50%. The stimulation effects resulted from enhanced bacterial growth and the overexpression of degradation genes. The inhibitory effects resulted from the toxicity of the CNTs at high concentrations. The differences between the two CNTs at tested concentrations were not significant. The biodegradation efficiency was not impacted by adsorption, and the pre-adsorbed atrazine on the CNTs was fully biodegraded when the CNT concentration was ≤25mg/L. This finding was consistent with the lack of observable desorption hysteresis for atrazine on the tested CNTs.

Here we tested several several strategies to improve the effectiveness of this technology, which involved various techniques to solubilize contaminants. The phytoremediation efficiency of Plantago major L. was improved more by liquid silicon dioxide (SiO₂) than by other solubility-enhancing agents, resulting in the removal of significant amounts of cyanophos from contaminated soil. Liquid SiO₂ increased the capacity of P. major L. to remove cyanophos from soil by 45.9% to 74.05%. In P. major L. with liquid SiO₂, leaves extracted more cyanophos (32.99 µg/g) than roots (13.33 µg/g) over 3 days. The use of solubilization agents such as surfactants, hydroxypropyl-ß-cyclodextrin (HPßCD), natural humic acid acid (HA), and Tween 80 resulted in the removal of 60 convergents of cyanophos from polluted soil. Although a batch equilibrium technique showed that use of HPßCD resulted in the efficient removal of cyanophos from soil, a greater amount of cyanophos was removed by P. major L. with SiO₂.

Cr concentration in roots, stem, and leaves of CA-supplied plant was significantly reduced while total uptake of Cr increased in all plant parts with CA application. Furthermore, in comparison with Cr treatments alone, CA supply reduced the MDA and EL values in both shoots and roots. Moreover, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), guaiacol peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in shoots and roots markedly increased by 100 μM Cr exposure, while decreased at 500 μM Cr stress. CA application enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes compared to the same Cr treatment alone. Thus, the data indicate that exogenous CA application can increase Cr uptake and can minimize Cr stress in plants and may be beneficial in accelerating the phytoextraction of Cr through hyper-accumulating plants such as B. napus.', 25898088: 'The performance of CRBR in denitrification with catechol carbon source is presented. The influence of inlet nitrate concentration, hydraulic retention time (HRT), media filling ratio and rotational speed of media on the performance of CRBR was investigated. The bioreactor could denitrify over 95% of the nitrate at an inlet concentration up to 1000 mg NO3(-)/L and a short HRT as low as 18 h. The optimum media filling ratio at which the maximum denitrification was achieved in the CRBR was 30% and the contribution of media at this condition was around 36%. The optimum ratio of media filling at which the maximum denitrification was 20 rpm and the contribution of rotational speed under this condition was around 17%. According to the findings, the CRBR is a high rate bioreactor and thus serves as an appropriate technology for denitrification of wastewaters containing a high concentration of nitrate and toxic organic compounds.', 25898093: 'In this study, the effect of COD/N ratio on completely autotrophic nitrogen removal over nitrite (CANON) process was investigated in five identical membrane bioreactors. The five reactors were simultaneously seeded for 1L CANON sludge and be operated for more than two months under same conditions, with influent COD/N ratio of 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4, respectively. DGGE was used to analyze the microbial communities of aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AAOB) in five reactors. Results revealed the harmonious work of CANON and denitrification with low COD concentration, whereas too high COD concentration suppressed both AOB and AAOB. AOB and AAOB biodiversity both decreased with COD increasing, which then led to worse nitrogen removal. The suppressing threshold of COD/N ratio for CANON was 1.7. CANON was feasible for treating low COD/N sewage, while the high sewage should be converted by anaerobic biogas producing process in advance.

The result is that there have been numerous investigations into changes in operational conditions, however to date all have focused on the qualitative sensitivities, neglecting the quantitative. This study therefore aimed to determine the quantitative sensitivities by using factorial design of experiments and small semi continuous reactors. Analysis showed total and volatile solids removals are chiefly influenced by retention time, with 79% and 59% of the observed results being attributed to retention time respectively, whereas biogas was mainly influenced by loading rate, 38%, and temperature, 22%. Notably the regression model fitted to the experimental data predicted full-scale performance with a high level of precision, indicating that small reactors are subject to the same sensitivity of full-scale digesters and thus can be used to predict changes loading, retention time, and temperature.

In this study, we report the assimilation and utilization of nitrate luxuriant levels, 20 times more than the highest N fertilizer application in Europe, by transgenic poplars overexpressing a cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1). In comparison with the wild-type controls, transgenic plants grown under high N levels exhibited increased biomass (171.6%) and accumulated higher levels of proteins, chlorophylls and total sugars such as glucose, fructose and sucrose. These plants also exhibited greater nitrogen-use efficiency particularly in young leaves, suggesting that they are able to translocate most of the resources to the above-ground part of the plant to produce biomass. The transgenic poplar transcriptome was greatly affected in response to N availability with 1237 genes differentially regulated in high N, while only 632 genes were differentially expressed in untransformed plants. Many of these genes are essential in the adaptation and response against N excess and include those involved in photosynthesis, cell wall formation and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. Cellulose production in the transgenic plants was fivefold higher than in control plants, indicating that transgenic poplars represent a potential feedstock for applications in bioenergy. In conclusion, our results show that GS transgenic poplars can be used not only for improving growth and biomass production but also as an important resource for potential phytoremediation of nitrate pollution.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of nickel, one of the most abundant inorganic element in crude oil and the main component of hydrogen catalysts for oil refining, on the microbial community structure in artificially petroleum-contaminated microcosms and in solid phase bioreactor studies. In the presence of metals, the oil biodegradation in microcosms was significantly delayed during the first 7 days of operation. Also, increasing amounts of moisture generated a positive influence on the biodegradation processes. The oil concentration, exhibiting the most negative influence at the end of the treatment period. Molecular fingerprinting analyses (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis--DGGE) indicated that the inclusion of nickel into the contaminated soil promoted direct changes to the microbial community structure. By the end of the experiments, the results of the total petroleum hydrocarbons removal in the bioreactor and the microcosm were similar, but reductions in the treatment times were observed with the bioreactor experiments. An analysis of the microbial community structure by DGGE using various markers showed distinct behaviors between two treatments containing high nickel concentrations. The main conclusion of this study was that Nickel promotes a significant delay in oil biodegradation, despite having only a minor effect over the microbial community.', 25940488: 'Pot experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of gibberellic acid (GA3) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on growth parameters, cadmium (Cd) phytoextraction, total phenolics, free proline and chlorophyll content of Parthenium hysterophorus plant grown in Cd-contaminated (100\\xa0mg/kg) soil. GA3 was applied as foliar spray (10(-2), 10(-4) and 10(-6)\\xa0M) while EDTA (40\\xa0mg/kg soil) was added to soil as single and in split doses. Results showed decrease in growth parameters due to Cd stress but P. hysterophorus plant demonstrated Cd hyperaccumulator potential based on bioconcentration factor (BCF). Lower concentration of GA3 (10(-6)\\xa0M) showed highest significant increase in the growth parameters while Cd concentration, accumulation (1.97\\u2009±\\u20090.11\\xa0mg/DBM) and bioconcentration (9.75\\u2009±\\u20090.34) was significantly higher in the treatment T11 (GA3 10(-2)\\u2009+\\u2009split doses of EDTA). Cadmium significantly increased the root free proline while total phenolic concentration was significantly high in all parts of the plant. Chlorophyll contents were significantly reduced by Cd.

The aim of this study was to analyze the biodegradation of sugarcane juice vinasse in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The content of carbohydrates, proteins and volatile fatty acids was evaluated. Vinasse samples showed a high biodegradability (>96.5 %) and low percentage of inert chemical oxygen demand (COD) (<3.2 %) in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The rates of substrate utilization were slightly higher in aerobic reactors, but COD stabilization occurred simultaneously in the anaerobic reactors, confirming its suitability for anaerobic digestion. Inert COD in anaerobic conditions was lower than in aerobic conditions. On the other hand, COD from metabolic products in the anaerobic reactors was higher than in the aerobic ones, indicating an increased release of soluble microbial products (SMPs) by anaerobic microorganisms. The results indicated that carbohydrates were satisfactorily degraded and protein-like substances were the major components remaining after biological degradation of vinasse.', 25958147: 'CO2 fixation between microalgal biomass and culture solution and the weight ratio of biomass consumption at nighttime to biomass growth at daytime were compared in an open raceway pond aerated with flue gas from a coal-fired power plant. Average daytime sunlight intensity and solution temperature were optimized to improve microalgal growth rate and to enhance the efficiency of CO2 fixation. When the average daytime solution temperature increased from 12 to 26°C, the rate of biomass consumption due to microalgal respiration at nighttime increased from 6.0 to 7.9g/m(2)/d, which was approximately 25% of the biomass growth rate at daytime. Furthermore, when the average daytime sunlight intensity increased from 39,900 to 88,300lux, CO2 fixation rate in the microalgal biomass increased from 18.4 to 40.7g/m(2)/d, which was approximately 1/3 of CO2 removal rate from flue gas by the microalgal culture system.

Changes in total bacterial and archaeal population numbers were analyzed using qPCR and were compared to results from a blank and negative control to assess for microbial toxicity. Additionally, the results were compared to those of samples exposed to silver nanoparticles and iron filings in an attempt to discern the source of toxicity. Statistical analysis revealed that the three different iron treatments were equally toxic to the total bacteria and archaea populations, as compared with the controls. Conversely, the silver nanoparticles had a limited statistical impact when compared to the controls and increased the microbial populations in some instances. Therefore, the findings suggest that zero-valent iron toxicity does not result from a unique nanoparticle-based effect.

Present at lower concentrations are a suite of aromatic compounds that can inhibit fermentation by biofuel-producing microbes. We have developed a microbial-mediated strategy for removing these aromatic compounds, using the purple nonsulfur bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris. When grown photoheterotrophically in an anaerobic environment, R. palustris removes most of the aromatics from ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) treated corn stover hydrolysate (ACSH), while leaving the sugars mostly intact. We show that R. palustris can metabolize a host of aromatic substrates in ACSH that have either been previously described as unable to support growth, such as methoxylated aromatics, and those that have not yet been tested, such as aromatic amides. Removing the aromatics from ACSH with R. palustris, allowed growth of a second microbe that could not grow in the untreated ACSH. By using defined mutants, we show that most of these aromatic compounds are metabolized by the benzoyl-CoA pathway. We also show that loss of enzymes in the benzoyl-CoA pathway prevents total degradation of the aromatics in the hydrolysate, and instead allows for biological transformation of this suite of aromatics into selected aromatic compounds potentially recoverable as an additional bioproduct.

Addition of CGY at thermophilic temperature range showed a negative impact on stability and performance of the process, even at low doses. The extreme pH values of CGY, together with the rapid release of VFA, causes SS alkalinity fail to control pH drop. On the contrary, at mesophilic temperature range the process performs steadily, with 148% increase in methane production when CGY represented 1% v/v of the influent (27% of influent COD). Further CGY percentages did not show any added improvement; the biomass shift, due to a high C/N ratio, could explain this behaviour. Results suggested that CGY can be used as co-substrate of SS anaerobic digestion though, depending on the characteristics of CGY, and on operational conditions, different parameters should be taken into account to achieve a steady and consistent operation.

At the end of 3-month experiment, a significant dissipation of BDE-47 was observed in the planted soil, and this dissipation, particularly in rhizosphere soil, was significantly accelerated by the frequent addition of N in the form of ammonium chloride. The removal percentage of BDE-47 in the rhizosphere soil without N addition was 47.3% and increased to 58.2% with N. However, the unplanted soil only removed less than 25% BDE-47, irrespective to N supply. The N addition in planted treatments significantly increased soil N content, urease and dehydrogenase activities, and the abundances of total bacteria and dehalogenating bacteria, leading to more microbial degradation of BDE-47. The N addition also enhanced the root uptake and translocation of PBDEs to above-ground tissues of A. corniculatum. These results suggested that N addition could enhance the phytoremediation of BDE-47-contaminated soil within a short period of time. Different from BDE-47, BDE-209 in all contaminated soils was difficult to be removed due to its persistence and low bioavailability.

The biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests in Experiment I were performed at a constant inoculum to substrate ratio (ISR), whereas, different ISRs were applied in Experiment II. Results obtained from Experiment I revealed that methane potential of substrate increased at a saturating trend with higher substrate concentrations, and could differ by up to 30% between the lowest and highest investigated concentrations. The results of Experiment II verified the results of Experiment I, and further showed that this trend also occurs when the substrate concentration is regulated with ISRs. In contrast, substrate concentration had no significant impact on the degradation kinetics. It was concluded that dilutions should be avoided when the substrate concentration is lower than 10 g VS/L in order to avoid underestimations of methane potential from BMP test.', 26218185: 'A long-term evaluation of a mesophilic up-flow intermittently stirred tank reactor (UISTR) for hydrogen production from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste was investigated.

By using RNA sequencing, we evaluated the growth response of two invasive plants, goutweed (Aegopodium podagraria L.) and mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris), grown in two Appalachian acid-mine soils (MS-I and -II, pH ∼ 4.6). Although deficient in macronutrients, both soils contained high levels of plant-available Al, Fe and Mn. Both plant types showed toxicity tolerance, but metal accumulation differed by plant and site. With MS-I, Al accumulation was greater for mugwort than goutweed (385 ± 47 vs 2151 ± 251 μg g-1). Al concentration was similar between mine sites, but its accumulation in mugwort was greater with MS-I than MS-II, with no difference in accumulation by site for goutweed. An in situ approach revealed deregulation of multiple factors such as transporters, transcription factors, and metal chelators for metal uptake or exclusion. The two plant systems showed common gene expression patterns for different pathways. Both plant systems appeared to have few common heavy-metal pathway regulators addressing mineral toxicity/deficiency in both mine sites, which implies adaptability of invasive plants for efficient growth at mine sites with toxic waste.

To better understand carbon and nutrient dynamics, it is important to know the contribution of solar radiation to leaf litter decomposition of different arid-zone species. Here we investigated: (1) whether such contribution varies among plant species at given irradiance regime, (2) whether interspecific variation in such contribution correlates with interspecific variation in the decomposition rate under shade; and (3) whether this correlation can be explained by leaf traits. We conducted a factorial experiment to determine the effects of solar radiation and environmental moisture for the mass loss and the decomposition constant k-values of 13 species litters collected in Northern China. The contribution of solar radiation to leaf litter decomposition varied significantly among species. Solar radiation accelerated decomposition in particular in the species that already decompose quickly under shade. Functional traits, notably specific leaf area, might predict the interspecific variation in that contribution. Our results provide the first empirical evidence for how the effect of solar radiation on decomposition varies among multiple species. Thus, the effect of solar radiation on the carbon flux between biosphere and atmosphere may depend on the species composition of the vegetation.

Consequently, cadmium (Cd)- and lead (Pb)-resistant fungi and citric acid (CA) were introduced to enhance phytoextraction by Solanum nigrum L. under varied Cd and Pb pollution levels in a greenhouse pot experiment. We then determined accumulation of Cd and Pb in S. nigrum and the soil enzyme activities of dehydrogenase, phosphatase, urease, catalase, sucrase, and amylase. Detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) was applied to assess the interactions between remediation strategies and soil enzyme activities. Results indicated that the addition of fungi, CA, or their combination enhanced the root biomass of S. nigrum, especially at the high-pollution level. The combined treatment of CA and fungi enhanced accumulation of Cd about 22-47 % and of Pb about 13-105 % in S. nigrum compared with the phytoextraction alone. However, S. nigrum was not shown to be a hyperaccumulator for Pb. Most enzyme activities were enhanced after remediation. The DCCA ordination graph showed increasing enzyme activity improvement by remediation in the order of phosphatase, amylase, catalase, dehydrogenase, and urease.

DMP exhibits slow biodegradation, and its coupled treatment by means of advanced oxidation may enhance its biotransformation and mineralization. We evaluated two ways of coupling UV-H2O2 advanced oxidation to biodegradation: sequential coupling and intimate coupling in an internal circulation baffled biofilm reactor (ICBBR). During sequential coupling, UV-H2O2 pretreatment generated carboxylic acids that depressed the pH, and subsequent biodegradation generated phthalic acid; both factors inhibited DMP biodegradation. During intimately coupled UV-H2O2 with biodegradation, carboxylic acids and phthalic acid (PA) did not accumulate, and the biodegradation rate was 13 % faster than with biodegradation alone and 78 % faster than with biodegradation after UV-H2O2 pretreatment. Similarly, DMP oxidation with intimate coupling increased by 5 and 39 %, respectively, compared with biodegradation alone and sequential coupling. The enhancement effects during intimate coupling can be attributed to the rapid catabolism of carboxylic acids, which generated intracellular electron carriers that directly accelerated di-oxygenation of PA and relieved the inhibition effect of PA and low pH. Thus, intimate coupling optimized the impacts of energy input from UV irradiation used together with biodegradation.', 26378321: 'Rates of litter decomposition in dryland ecosystems are consistently underestimated by decomposition models driven by temperature, moisture, and litter chemistry. The most common explanation for this pattern is that ultraviolet radiation (UV) increases decomposition through photodegradation of the litter lignin fraction. Alternatively, UV could increase decomposition through effects on microbial activity. To assess the mechanisms underlying UV photodegradation in a semiarid climate, we exposed high- and low-lignin litter to ambient and blocked UV over 15 months in a Mediterranean ecosystem. We hypothesized that UV would increase litter mass loss, that UV would preferentially increase mass loss of the lignin fraction, and that UV would have a negative effect on microbial activity. Consistent with our first hypothesis, we found that UV-blocking reduced litter mass loss from 16% to 1% in high-lignin litter and from 29% to 17% in low-lignin litter. Contrary to our second hypothesis, UV treatment did not have a significant effect on lignin content in either litter type. Instead, UV-blocking significantly reduced cellulose and hemicellulose mass loss in both litter types. Contrary to our third hypothesis, we observed a positive effect of UV on both fungal abundance and the potential activities of several assayed extracellular enzymes. Additionally, under ambient UV only, we found significant correlations between potential activities of cellulase and oxidase enzymes and both the concentrations and degradation rates of their target compounds. Our results indicate that UV is a significant driver of litter mass loss in Mediterranean ecosystems, but not solely because UV directly degrades carbon compounds such as lignin. Rather, UV facilitates microbial degradation of litter compounds, such as cellulose and hemicellulose. Thus, unexpectedly high rates of litter decomposition previously attributed directly to UV in dryland ecosystems may actually derive from a synergistic interaction between UV and microbes.', 26386418: 'The study evaluated acute impact of tetracycline on the biodegradation of acetate by microbial cultures acclimated to different growth conditions.

The first run served as control and others were started with tetracycline doses of 100mg/L and 400mg/L. Parallel batch reactors were also operated for oxygen uptake rate (OUR) measurements. Acute impact was evaluated by model calibration of OUR, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and intracellular storage profiles. Exposure to tetracycline did not impair COD removal but induced a shift in acetate utilization toward polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) storage.

Results of genome comparison, including BCP1, R7, along with other Rhodococcus reference strains, showed that at least 30% of the genome of each strain presented unique sequences and only 50% of the predicted proteome was shared. To associate genomic features with metabolic capabilities of BCP1 and R7 strains, hundreds of different growth conditions were tested through Phenotype Microarray, by using Biolog plates and plates manually prepared with additional xenobiotic compounds. Around one-third of the surveyed carbon sources was utilized by both strains although R7 generally showed higher metabolic activity values compared to BCP1. Moreover, R7 showed broader range of nitrogen and sulphur sources. Phenotype Microarray data were combined with genomic analysis to genetically support the metabolic features of the two strains. The genome analysis allowed to identify some gene clusters involved in the metabolism of the main tested xenobiotic compounds. Results show that R7 contains multiple genes for the degradation of a large set of aromatic and PAHs compounds, while a lower variability in terms of genes predicted to be involved in aromatic degradation was found in BCP1. This genetic feature can be related to the strong genetic pressure exerted by the two different environment from which the two strains were isolated. According to this, in the BCP1 genome the smo gene cluster involved in the short-chain n-alkanes degradation, is included in one of the unique regions and it is not conserved in the Rhodococcus strains compared in this work.

When compared to the anaerobic transformation of nitrate by microbes in the presence of Fe(0) alone, the presence of biochar significantly enhanced anaerobic denitrification by microbes with Fe(0). Graphite also promoted the anaerobic microbial transformation of nitrate with Fe(0), and it was speculated that electron-conducting graphene moieties were responsible for the improvement. The results obtained in this work suggest that nitrate can be effectively denitrified by microbes with Fe(0) and biochar in natural and engineered systems.

This study used bioaugmentation to investigate the biodegradation of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in sediment microcosms collected from an electronic-waste recycling site. Treatments included adding possible biodegradation intermediates of TBBPA, including 2,4-dibromophenol (2,4-DBP), 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP), and bisphenol A (BPA) as co-substrates. Bioaugmentation was done with Ochrobactrum sp. T (TBBPA-degrader) and a mixed culture of Ochrobactrum sp. T, Bacillus sp. GZT (TBP-degrader) and Bacillus sp. GZB (BPA-degrader). Results showed that bioaugmentation with Ochrobactrum sp. T significantly improved TBBPA degradation efficiencies in sediment microcosms (P < 0.01); aerobic conditions increased the microbes' degradation activities. Co-substrates 2,4-DBP, TBP and BPA inhibited biodegradation of TBBPA. A metagenomic analysis of total 16S rRNA genes from the treated sediment microcosms showed that the following dominant genera: Ochrobactrum, Parasegetibacter, Thermithiobacillus, Phenylobacterium and Sphingomonas. The genus level of Ochrobactrum increased with increased degradation time, within 10-week of incubation.

All the pretreatments released formic and acetic acids and phenolic compounds, while 5-hydroxymetilfurfural (HMF) and furfural were generated only by acid pretreatment. A remarkable inhibition was found in most of the whole slurry experiments, except in thermal pretreatment which improved methane production compared to the raw materials (29% for WS and 11% for SCB). The alkaline pretreatment increased biodegradability (around 30%) and methane production rate of the solid fraction of both pretreated substrates. Methane production results were fitted using first order or modified Gompertz equations, or a novel model combining both equations. The model parameters provided information about substrate availability, controlling step and inhibitory effect of compounds generated by each pretreatment.

The effect of pH, AMX initial concentration, presence of water ingredients, the effect of HRT, and mineralization level by VUV process were taken into consideration. In order to make a direct comparison, the test was also performed by UVC radiation. The results show that the degradation of AMX was following the first-order kinetic. It was found that direct photolysis by UVC was able to degrade 50mg/L of AMX in 50min,while it was 3min for VUV process. It was also found that the removal efficiency by VUV process was directly influenced by pH of the solution, and higher removal rates were achieved at high pH values.The results show that 10mg/L of AMX was completely degraded and mineralized within 50s and 100s, respectively, indicating that the AMX was completely destructed into non-hazardous materials. Operating the photoreactor in contentious-flow mode revealed that 10mg/L AMX was completely degraded and mineralized at HRT values of 120s and 300s. it was concluded that the VUV advanced process was an efficient and viable technique for degradation and mineralization of contaminated water by antibiotics.

However, S. validus and I. tectorum was obviously suppressed when TAN was above 100 mg L(-1). High TAN generated obvious oxidative stress showing increased proline and malondialdehyde contents, and superoxide dismutase was inhibited.

UV photolysis converted TCP into dichlorocatechol, monochlorophenol, and dichlorophenol, and this relieved inhibition by TCP. Phenol-removal and biomass-growth rates were significantly accelerated after UV photolysis: the monod maximum specific growth rate (μ(max)) increased by 9% after TCP photolysis, and the half-maximum-rate concentration (K(S)) decreased by 36%.

The total spiked PAH concentration was 2166mg/kg. Mercury amendment was also made to give an abiotic control. A novel kinetic model has been developed to explain the observed biphasic nature of PAH degradation. The model assumes that PAHs are distributed across soil phases of varying degrees of bioaccessibility. The results of the analysis suggest that overall percentage PAH loss is dependent on the respective rates at which the PAHs (a) are biodegraded by soil microorganisms in pore water and bioaccessible soil phases and (b) migrate from bioaccessible to non-bioaccessible soil phases. In addition, migration of PAHs to non-bioaccessible and non-Soxhlet-extractable soil phases associated with the humin pores gives rise to an apparent removal process. The presence of metal co-contaminants shows a concentration dependent inhibition of the biological degradation processes that results in a reduction in overall degradation. Lead appears to have a marginally greater inhibitory effect than cadmium. ', 26852881: 'Little is known about the effect of elemental sulfur on lead uptake and its toxicity in wheat. A pot experiment was conducted with the purpose to examine the impact of sulfur on improving Pb solubility in soil, and uptake and accumulation in wheat plants. The effect of three levels of lead (0, 50, and 100\\xa0mg/kg soil) and sulfur (0, 150, and 300\\xa0mmol/kg soil) was tested in all possible combinations. Root dry matter, straw, and grain yields, and the photosynthetic and transpiration rates decreased significantly with increase in the concentration of Pb in the soil. However, sulfur fertilization in the presence of Pb improved the photosynthetic and transpiration rates and consequently increased the straw and grain yields of wheat. It also enhanced Pb accumulation in roots, its translocation from roots to shoot, and accumulation in grain. S and Zn contents of different plant parts were also enhanced. Thus, by mitigating the toxic effect of Pb and improving wheat growth, sulfur enhances Pb accumulation by the aboveground plant parts and hence the phytoextraction capacity of wheat. However, total accumulation of Pb shows that wheat plant cannot be considered as a suitable candidate for phytoremediation.

Cadmium concentration, bioconcentration factor, enzyme activities and thiols content enhanced in plants with the increase of Cd treatments, time of exposure and at both CO2 levels. Glutathione levels increased only at AC. Growth, photosynthetic and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and the reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione ratio declined in plants with increasing exposure time, Cd treatments and at both CO2 levels.

The bioreactor was operated for 164days with varying influent Cr(VI) concentrations (2.0-50.0mg/L) and hydraulic retention times (HRT, 10-24h). It was shown that complete denitrification and Cr(VI) reduction could be achieved when influent Cr(VI) concentrations were lower than 20mg/L with a HRT of 17h. Shortening the HRT could significantly reduce the effluent CODcr. It was also observed that Cr(III) was mainly immobilized on the biofilm. Further investigation on Cr distribution in the biofilm compartments indicated that Cr(VI) reduction occurred in all compartments and the intercellular Cr was dominant. High-throughput sequencing analysis showed that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the biofilm and Cr(VI) stress had a negative effect on the abundance of most bacteria.

The half-life, the quantum yield and the reaction rate were determined and a total of 36 photolysis products were detected and identified using liquid chromatography-high resolution-mass spectrometry. The half-lives of all six BTs were in the range of 6-24\\xa0h under the experimental conditions. Though the quantum yields were comparatively low (0.0007-0.0021), the environmental half-lives ranged from 2.4 to 8\\xa0d, suggesting that sunlight photolysis is still a relevant degradation process of BTs in surface waters. The photolysis pathway of 1H-BT under simulated sunlight differed from that suggested for UV-radiation, in that aminophenol is formed directly rather than via aniline. Similar pathways were found for the other BTs, except for 4-hydroxy-1H-benzotriazole (4OH-BT). Most identified transformation products of the BTs showed a high reactivity and appear not to persist in the environment. Upon co-photolysis of BTs with dissolved organic matter (DOM), however, series of reaction products were determined by Fourier transform - ion cyclotron resonance - mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) which are formed by reaction of photolysis intermediates of the BTs with DOM.

Because radionuclides accumulated in soil and plant biomass can be harmful for organisms, the functioning of ecosystems may be altered by radioactive contamination. Here, we tested the hypothesis that decomposition is impaired by increasing levels of radioactivity in the environment by exposing uncontaminated leaf litter from silver birch and black alder at (i) eleven distant forest sites differing in ambient radiation levels (0.22-15μGyh(-1)) and (ii) along a short distance gradient of radioactive contamination (1.2-29μGyh(-1)) within a single forest in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. In addition to measuring ambient external dose rates, we estimated the average total dose rates (ATDRs) absorbed by decomposers for an accurate estimate of dose-induced ecological consequences of radioactive pollution. Taking into account potential confounding factors (soil pH, moisture, texture, and organic carbon content), the results from the eleven distant forest sites, and from the single forest, showed increased litter mass loss with increasing ATDRs from 0.3 to 150μGyh(-1). This unexpected result may be due to (i) overcompensation of decomposer organisms exposed to radionuclides leading to a higher decomposer abundance (hormetic effect), and/or (ii) from preferred feeding by decomposers on the uncontaminated leaf litter used for our experiment compared to locally produced, contaminated leaf litter. Our data indicate that radio-contamination of forest ecosystems over more than two decades does not necessarily have detrimental effects on organic matter decay. However, further studies are needed to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the results reported here, in order to draw firmer conclusions on how radio-contamination affects decomposition and associated ecosystem processes.', 27152459: 'Fatty acid amides from plant root exudates, such as oleamide and erucamide, have the ability to participate in strong plant-microbe interactions, stimulating nitrogen metabolism in rhizospheric bacteria. However, mechanisms of secretion of such fatty acid amides, and the nature of their stimulatory activities on microbial metabolism, have not been examined. In the present study, collection, pre-treatment, and determination methods of oleamide and erucamide in duckweed root exudates are compared. The detection limits of oleamide and erucamide by gas chromatography (GC) (10.3ngmL(-1) and 16.1ngmL(-1), respectively) are shown to be much lower than those by liquid chromatography (LC) (1.7 and 5.0μgmL(-1), respectively).

Furthermore, fatty acid amide secretion was significantly enhanced under elevated nitrogen conditions (>300mgL(-1)), and was negatively correlated with the relative growth rate of duckweed. Mechanistic assays were conducted to show that erucamide stimulates nitrogen removal by enhancing denitrification, targeting two key denitrifying enzymes, nitrate and nitrite reductases, in bacteria.

The growth of Chara during the exposure was higher in epilimnetic conditions (40%) compared to both hypolimnetic pyrene exposed Chara and controls (epilimnetic and hypolimnetic, no pyrene). In the water, a more rapid dissipation of pyrene was observed in epilimnetic conditions, possibly as a result of the increased algal growth. In the cortex, pyrene, 1-OH-pyrene (minor metabolite) and an unknown hydrophobic major metabolite was measured. Pyrene amounts decreased over time, while amounts of the unknown metabolite increased. In internode cytoplasm, pyrene and 1-OH-pyrene showed initially increasing followed by decreasing trends, while the unknown metabolite was not detected. The total mass balance showed that we were able to account for the applied pyrene until 4 days of exposure. However, after this time, there was a significant decrease in amounts accounted for by fluorescence, suggesting that the metabolism of pyrene involves degradation of the ring structure. The degradation was larger in epilimnetic than hypolimnetic conditions.

Heterologous expression of OsMTP1 in tobacco resulted in the reduction of Cd stress-induced phytotoxic effects, including growth inhibition, lipid peroxidation, and cell death. Compared to untransformed control, the transgenic tobacco plants showed enhanced vacuolar thiol content, indicating vacuolar localization of the sequestered Cd. The transgenic tobacco plants exhibited significantly higher biomass growth (2.2-2.8-folds) and hyperaccumulation of Cd (1.96-2.22-folds) compared to untransformed control under Cd exposure. The transgenic plants also showed moderate tolerance and accumulation of arsenic (As) upon exogenous As stress, signifying broad substrate specificity of OsMTP1.

The main obstacle in this process is binding of organic pollutants to the microbial cell surface. To overcome these, we applied saponins from plant extract to the microbial culture, to increase pollutants solubility and enhance diffusive massive transfer. This study investigated the efficiency of Quillaja saponaria and Sapindus mukorossi saponins-rich extracts on biodegradation of halogenated phenols by Raoultella planticola WS2 and Pseudomonas sp. OS2, as an effect of cell surface modification of tested strains. Both strains display changes in inner membrane permeability and cell surface hydrophobicity in the presence of saponins during the process of halogenated phenols biotransformation. This allows them to more efficient pollutants removal from the environment. However, only in case of the Pseudomonas sp. OS2 the addition of surfactants to the culture improved effectiveness of bromo-, chloro- and fluorophenols biodegradation. Also introduction of surfactant allowed higher biodegradability of halogenated phenols and can shorten the process. Therefore this suggests that usage of plant saponins can indicate more successful halogenated phenols biodegradation for selected strains.

This article briefly discusses issues around Li, its role and its essentiality in plants and research directions that may assist in inter-disciplinary studies to evaluate the importance of Li's toxicity. Further, potential remediation approaches will also be highlighted in this review. Briefly, Li influenced the growth of plants in both stimulation and reduction ways, depending on the concentration of Li in growth medium. On the negative side, Li reduces the plant growth by interrupting numerous physiological processes and altering metabolism in plant. The contamination of soil by Li is becoming a serious problem, which might be a threat for crop production in the near future. Additionally, lack of considerable information about the tolerance mechanisms of plants further intensifies the situation.

Poplars (Populus spp.) are widely cultivated because of their rapid growth and high biomass production, and members of the genus are increasingly used as experimental model organisms of trees and for phytoremediation purposes. Our aim was to investigate the copper and zinc stress responses of three outstanding biomass producer bred poplar lines to identify such transcripts of genes involved in the detoxification mechanisms, which can play an important role in the protection against heavy metals. Poplar cuttings were grown hydroponically and subjected to short-term (one week) mild and sublethal copper and zinc stresses. We evaluated the effects of the applied heavy metals and the responses of plants by detecting the changes of multiple physiological and biochemical parameters. The most severe cellular oxidative damage was caused by 30μM copper treatment, while zinc was less harmful. Analysis of stress-related transcripts revealed genotype-specific differences that are likely related to alterations in heavy metal tolerance. P. deltoides clones B-229 and PE 19/66 clones were clearly more effective at inducing the expression of various genes implicated in the detoxification process, such as the glutathione transferases, metallothioneins, ABC transporters, (namely PtGSTU51, PxMT1, PdABCC2,3), while the P. canadensis line M-1 accumulated more metal, resulting in greater cellular oxidative damage. Our results show that all three poplar clones are efficient in stress acclimatization, but with different molecular bases.

A pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of biodegradable [S,S]-ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid (EDDS) and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) on plant growth and Pb accumulation of Pb phytostabilizer Athyrium wardii (Hook.) grown in Pb contaminated soils and to explore the feasibility of chelate-assisted phytostabilization. Greater adverse effects on plant biomass under high EDDS treatments were observed than NTA treatments. Significant increase of shoot Pb concentrations of A.\\xa0wardii was noticed with increasing NTA and EDDS dosages, while EDDS induced higher shoot Pb concentrations than NTA. Moreover, root Pb concentrations of A.\\xa0wardii under NTA treatments were 1.18-1.28-time higher than EDDS treatments, and a peak value of root Pb concentrations was observed at 2\\xa0mmol\\xa0kg(-1) of NTA. Shoot Pb accumulations significantly increased with increasing dosages, and EDDS treatments caused a 1.44-1.6-time increase of shoot Pb accumulation than NTA. Root Pb accumulations under NTA treatments were 1.18-1.28-time higher than EDDS treatments. Maximum root Pb accumulation (155.5\\xa0mg plant(-1)) was found at 2\\xa0mmol\\xa0kg(-1) of NTA on the 14th day. Higher BCF values and lower TF values were found under NTA treatments as compared to EDDS treatments. Available Pb concentrations in soil significantly increased on the 7th day with increasing NTA and EDDS dosages, then gradually decreased on the 14th day. Soil pH slightly decreased with increasing NTA and EDDS dosages. Therefore, chelate-assisted phytostabilization could be a feasible way to enhance the efficiency of Pb phytostabilization by A.\\xa0wardii.

A soil was sampled from a region of high natural <sup>226</sup>Ra radioactivity in Ramsar, Iran. After cultivation of corn seed and using organic acid treatments at 1, 10 and 100\\xa0mM concentrations, plants (shoots and roots) were harvested, digested and prepared to measure <sup>226</sup>Ra activity. Simultaneously, sequential selective extraction were performed to estimate the partitioning of <sup>226</sup>Ra among geochemical extraction.

These treatments increased radium uptake by a factor of 1.5 than the control. Enhancement of radium uptake by plants was related to soil pH reduction of organic acids in comparison to control. Also, the maximum uptake of this radionuclide in all treatments was obtained in roots compared to shoots. <sup>226</sup>Ra fractionations results revealed that 91.8% of radium was in the residual phase of the soil and the available fractions were less than 2%. As the main percent of <sup>226</sup>Ra was in the residual phase of the soil in this region, it seems that organic acids had not significant effect on the uptake of <sup>226</sup>Ra for phytoremediation by corn in this condition.', 27497351: \"Adding clay to marine oil pollution represents a promising approach to enhance bacterial hydrocarbon degradation in nutrient poor waters. In this study, three types of regionally available clays (Ca-bentonite, Fuller's Earth and kaolin) were tested to stimulate the biodegradation of source and weathered oil collected from the Deepwater Horizon spill. The weathered oil showed little biodegradation prior to experimentation and was extensively degraded by bacteria in the laboratory in a similar way as the alkane-rich source oil. For both oils, the addition of natural clay-flakes showed minor enhancement of oil biodegradation compared to the non-clay bearing control, but the clay-oil films did limit evaporation. Only alkanes of a molecular weight (MW)\\xa0>\\xa0420 showed significant reduction by enhanced biodegradation following natural clay treatment. In contrast, all fertilized clay flakes showed major bacterial degradation of the oil, with a 6-10 times reduction in alkane content, and an up to 8 fold increase in the rate of O2 consumption. Compared to the control, such treatment showed particular reduction of longer chained alkanes (MW\\xa0>\\xa0226). The application of natural and fertilized clay flakes also showed selective reduction of PAHs, mainly in the MW range of 200-300, but without significant change in the toxicity indices measured. These results imply that a large variety of clays may be used to boost oil biodegradation by aiding attachment of fertilizing nutrients to the oil. \", 27521784: 'The objective of this study was to determine the impact of solubilization during thermo-chemo-sonic pretreatment of waste activated sludge (WAS) on anaerobic biodegradability and cost for biogas production. The results revealed that it was possible to achieve 40-50% of solubilization of WAS when ultrasonic energy input was doubled (11,520-27,000kJ/kgTS). The cost to achieve 30-35% of solubilization of WAS was calculated to be 0.22-0.24USD/L, which was relatively lower than the cost of 0.53-0.8USD/L when 40-50% of solubilisation of WAS was achieved. There was no significant difference in biodegradability (0.60-0.64gCOD/gCOD) for samples with solubilization efficiency of 35-50%. Comparing energetic balance and economic assessment of samples with different solubilization percentages, the results showed that samples with 30-35% of solubilization had lower net cost (7.98-2.33USD/Ton of sludge) and negative energy balance compared to samples with other percentages of solubilization.

In the present study it was found that a mixture of hemin and excess cysteine was able to degrade the insecticide DDT partially. The major products were three water-soluble, non-toxic conjugates of DDT metabolites with cysteine which had lost two or three of the five chlorine atoms of DDT per molecule and whose structures were elucidated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. In 0.05 M NH4HCO3, pH 7.7/ethanol (5:6, by vol.), the degradation reaction catalyzed by the hemin-cysteine model system was at least 8 x 10(4) times faster than the uncatalyzed reaction. In the presence of a designed 24-residues polypeptide or beta-casein, two DDT-binding proteins, an additional fourfold increase in the rate of DDT degradation was observed. Although the concentrations of DDT and cysteine occurring in an organism would be expected to be lower than those in the experiments described, the formation of water-soluble conjugates of DDT metabolites with cysteine (and other amino acids) could also play a role in metabolism and excretion of DDT in vivo.', 27542199: \"Cadmium (Cd), a highly toxic heavy metal affects growth and metabolic pathways in plants, including photosynthesis. Though Cd is a transition metal with no redox capacity, it generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) indirectly and causes oxidative stress. Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in long-term Cd tolerance of poplar, candidate for Cd phytoremediation, are not well known. Hydroponically cultured poplar (Populus jacquemontiana var. glauca cv. 'Kopeczkii') plants were treated with 10 μM Cd for 4 weeks. Following a period of functional decline, the plants performed acclimation to the Cd induced oxidative stress as indicated by the decreased leaf malondialdehyde (MDA) content and the recovery of most photosynthetic parameters. The increased activity of peroxidases (PODs) could have a great impact on the elimination of hydrogen peroxide, and thus the recovery of photosynthesis, while the function of superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms seemed to be less important. Re-distribution of the iron content of leaf mesophyll cells into the chloroplasts contributed to the biosynthesis of the photosynthetic apparatus and some antioxidative enzymes. The delayed increase in photosynthetic activity in relation to the decline in the level of lipid peroxidation indicates that elimination of oxidative stress damage by acclimation mechanisms is required for the restoration of the photosynthetic apparatus during long-term Cd treatment.\", 27563923: \"Laccases (LCs) are multicopper oxidases that find application as versatile biocatalysts for the green bioremediation of environmental pollutants and xenobiotics. In this study we elucidate the degrading activity of Lac2 pure enzyme form Pleurotus pulmonarius towards aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) and M₁ (AFM₁). LC enzyme was purified using three chromatographic steps and identified as Lac2 through zymogram and LC-MS/MS. The degradation assays were performed in vitro at 25 °C for 72 h in buffer solution. AFB₁ degradation by Lac2 direct oxidation was 23%. Toxin degradation was also investigated in the presence of three redox mediators, (2,2'-azino-bis-[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]) (ABTS) and two naturally-occurring phenols, acetosyringone (AS) and syringaldehyde (SA). The direct effect of the enzyme and the mediated action of Lac2 with redox mediators univocally proved the correlation between Lac2 activity and aflatoxins degradation. The degradation of AFB₁ was enhanced by the addition of all mediators at 10 mM, with AS being the most effective (90% of degradation). AFM₁ was completely degraded by Lac2 with all mediators at 10 mM. The novelty of this study relies on the identification of a pure enzyme as capable of degrading AFB₁ and, for the first time, AFM₁, and on the evidence that the mechanism of an effective degradation occurs via the mediation of natural phenolic compounds. These results opened new perspective for Lac2 application in the food and feed supply chains as a biotransforming agent of AFB₁ and AFM₁.\", 27578531: 'A novel bacterium capable of utilizing metamitron as the sole source of carbon and energy was isolated from contaminated soil and identified as Rhodococcus sp.

In total, 5,907 genes were annotated with the COG, GO, KEGG, Pfam, Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL, and nr databases. The degradation rate of metamitron by the isolate MET obviously increased with increasing substrate concentrations from 1 to 10\\u2009mg/l and subsequently decreased at 100\\u2009mg/l. The optimal pH and temperature for metamitron biodegradation were 7.0 and 20-30\\u2009°C, respectively. Based on genome annotation of the metamitron degradation genes and the metabolites detected by HPLC-MS/MS, the following metamitron biodegradation pathways were proposed: 1) Metamitron was transformed into 2-(3-hydrazinyl-2-ethyl)-hydrazono-2-phenylacetic acid by triazinone ring cleavage and further mineralization; 2) Metamitron was converted into 3-methyl-4-amino-6(2-hydroxy-muconic acid)-1,2,4-triazine-5(4H)-one by phenyl ring cleavage and further mineralization.

However, most pure microorganisms can degrade only limited species of NP with low degradation efficiencies. To establish a microbial consortium that can effectively degrade different forms of NP, in this study, we isolated a facultative microbial consortium NP-M2 and characterized the biodegradation of NP by it. NP-M2 could degrade 75.61% and 89.75% of 1000\\xa0mg/L NP within 48\\xa0h and 8 days, respectively; an efficiency higher than that of any other consortium or pure microorganism reported so far. The addition of yeast extract promoted the biodegradation more significantly than that of glucose. Moreover, surface-active compounds secreted into the extracellular environment were hypothesized to promote high-efficiency metabolism of NP. The detoxification of NP by this consortium was determined. The degradation pathway was hypothesized to be initiated by oxidization of the benzene ring, followed by step-wise side-chain biodegradation. The bacterial composition of NP-M2 was determined using 16S rDNA library, and the consortium was found to mainly comprise members of the Sphingomonas, Pseudomonas, Alicycliphilus, and Acidovorax genera, with the former two accounting for 86.86% of the consortium.

Our findings help to assign functions to specific structural features of biofilms, as they strongly imply a molecularly regulated mechanism by which freely accessed alkali-earth metals in natural waters affect the cellular uptake of FQAs at the water-biofilm interface. Specifically, formation of alkali-earth-metal (Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>) bridge between modeling ciprofloxacin and biofilms of Escherichia coli regulates the trans-biofilm transport rate of FQAs towards cells (135-nm-thick biofilm). As the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (0-3.5\\xa0mmol/L, CIP: 1.25\\xa0μmol/L), the transport rates were reduced to 52.4% and 63.0%, respectively. Computational chemistry analysis further demonstrated a deprotonated carboxyl in the tryptophan residues of biofilms acted as a major bridge site, of which one side is a metal and the other is a metal girder jointly connected to the carboxyl and carbonyl of a FQA. The bacterial growth rate depends on the bridging energy at anchoring site, which underlines the environmental importance of metal bridge formed in biofilm matrices in bacterially antibiotic resistance.', 27638464: 'Biomethanation of rice straw (RS) was studied in a batch mode at high total solid content (TSC) of 25% in outdoor pilot scale digesters.

Enzyme-catalyzed oxidative coupling reactions (ECOCRs) can be used to remove TCS in aqueous solution, but there is limited information available to indicate how metal cations (MCs) and natural organic matter (NOM) influence the environmental fate of TCS during laccase-mediated ECOCRs. In this study, we demonstrated that the naturally occurring laccase from Pleurotus ostreatus was effective in removing TCS during ECOCRs, and the oligomerization of TCS was identified as the dominant reaction pathway by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). The growth inhibition studies of green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Scenedesmus obliquus) proved that laccase-mediated ECOCRs could effectively reduce the toxicity of TCS. The presence of dissolved MCs (Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Al<sup>3+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions) influenced the removal and transformation of TCS via different mechanisms. Additionally, the transformation of TCS in systems with NOM derived from humic acid (HA) was hindered, and the apparent pseudo first-order kinetics rate constants (k) for TCS decreased as the HA concentration increased, which likely corresponded to the combined effect of both noncovalent (sorption) and covalent binding between TCS and humic molecules.

The carbon concentration used was 10 micrograms of C liter-1, and the media were designed to provide at least 95% of the citrate complexed to the metal studied. After 72 h of incubation, 80% of the uncomplexed citric acid and 76% of the magnesium citrate had been decomposed. A marked inhibition was observed when Cd2+, Cu2+, or Zn2+ was bound to the organic anion; only 23% of the cadmium citrate, 14% of the zinc citrate, and 5% of the cuprous citrate had been decomposed. The effects were not the result of toxicity, since experiments run with [14C]glucose (nonchelating compound) instead of citrate resulted in similar decomposition rates regardless of the presence of the metal. To examine whether the binding of a metal to citrate enhanced its uptake by the Klebsiella sp., we studied the relative uptake of 65Zn in citrate- and in glucose-containing media. No such effect could be observed, with the uptake of Zn2+ being higher in the glucose-containing media. The study shows that metals may render low-molecular-weight organic acids, such as citric acid, resistant to bacterial degradation. This stresses the importance of metals in influencing microbial decomposition of organic compounds, not only as a result of toxicity.', 27669376: 'Soil microcosms were constructed and monitored to evaluate the impact of substrate addition and transient aerobic and anaerobic conditions on TNT, RDX and HMX biodegradation in grenade range soils. While TNT was rapidly biodegraded under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions with and without organic substrate, substantial biodegradation of RDX, HMX, and RDX daughter products was not observed under aerobic conditions. However, RDX and HMX were significantly biodegraded under anaerobic conditions, without accumulation of TNT or RDX daughter products (2-ADNT, 4-ADNT, MNX, DNX, and TNX). In separate microcosms containing grenade range soil, glycerin and lignosulfonate addition enhanced oxygen consumption, increasing the consumption rate >200% compared to untreated soils. Mathematical model simulations indicate that oxygen consumption rates of 5 to 20g/m<sup>3</sup>/d can be achieved with reasonable amendment loading rates.

Soil microbial communities can affect plant growth, metal availability and the performance of phytoextraction-assisting inocula. Understanding the basic ecology of indigenous soil communities associated with the phytoextraction process, including the interplay between selective pressures upon the communities, is an important step towards phytoextraction optimization. This study investigated the impact of cadmium (Cd), and the presence of a Cd-accumulating plant, Carpobrotus rossii (Haw.) Schwantes, on the structure of soil-bacterial and fungal communities using automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Whilst Cd had no detectable influence upon fungal communities, bacterial communities underwent significant structural changes with no reduction in 16S rRNA copy number. The presence of C. rossii influenced the structure of all communities and increased ITS copy number. Suites of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) changed in abundance in response to either Cd or C. rossii, however we found little evidence to suggest that the two selective pressures were acting synergistically. The Cd-induced turnover in bacterial OTUs suggests that Cd alters competition dynamics within the community. Further work to understand how competition is altered could provide a deeper understanding of the microbiome-plant-environment and aid phytoextraction optimization.', 27815590: 'Propionate degradation is a critical step during the conversion of complex organic matter under methanogenic conditions, and it requires a syntrophic cooperation between propionate-oxidizing bacteria and methanogenic archaea. Increasing evidences suggest that interspecies electron transfer for syntrophic metabolism is not limited to the reducing equivalents of hydrogen and formate. This study tested the ability of an electron shuttle to mediate interspecies electron transfer in syntrophic methanogenesis. We found that cysteine supplementation (100, 400, and 800\\xa0μM) accelerated CH<sub>4</sub> production from propionate in paddy soil enrichments. Of the concentrations tested, 100\\xa0μM cysteine was the most effective at enhancing propionate degradation to CH<sub>4</sub>, and the rates of CH<sub>4</sub> production and propionate degradation were increased by 109 and 79%, respectively, compared with the cysteine-free control incubations. We eliminated the possibility that the stimulatory effect of cysteine on methanogenesis was attributable to the function of cysteine as a methanogenic substrate in the presence of propionate. The potential catalytic effect involved cysteine serving as an electron carrier to mediate interspecies electron transfer in syntrophic propionate oxidization. The redox potential of cystine/cysteine, which is dependent on the concentration, might be more suitable to facilitate interspecies electron transfer between syntrophic partners at a concentration of 100\\xa0μM. Pelotomaculum, obligately syntrophic, propionate-oxidizing bacteria, and hydrogenotrophic methanogens of the family Methanobacteriaceae are predominant in cysteine-mediated methanogenic propionate degradation.

However, it remains largely unknown about how microbial PAH-degraders, which play a key role in the biodegradation of soil PAHs, respond to the amendments of agricultural wastes. Here, a 90-day soil microcosm study was conducted to compare the effects of three agricultural wastes (i.e. WS, wheat stalk; MCSW, mushroom cultivation substrate waste; and CM, cow manure) on the dissipation of aged PAHs and the abundance and community structure of PAH-degrading microorganisms. The results showed that all the three agricultural wastes accelerated the dissipation of aged PAHs and significantly increased abundances of the bacterial 16S rRNA and PAH-degrading genes (i.e. pdo1 and nah). CM and MCSW with lower ratios of C:N eliminated soil PAHs more efficiently than WS with a high ratio of C:N. Low molecular weight PAHs were dissipated more quickly than those with high molecular weight. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all of the nah and C12O clones were affiliated within Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, and application of agricultural wastes significantly changed the community structure of the microorganisms harboring nah and C12O genes, particularly in the CM treatment.

Results showed that in the absence of AMF, increasing ZnONPs concentrations caused significant decline in root nodule number and biomass in fenugreek. In non-AMF plants, shoot length, and biomass of both root and shoot decreased at ≥375\\xa0μg\\xa0g<sup>-1</sup> of ZnONPs treatment; while Zn uptake by shoot and root increased as a function of ZnONPs treatments. Interestingly, AMF colonization in roots significantly diminished at 375\\xa0μg\\xa0g<sup>-1</sup> ZnONPs treatment compared to controls. More importantly, AMF inoculation ameliorated inhibitory effects of ZnONPs by promoting secretion of glycoprotein called glomalin-a potent metal chelator-within the rhizosphere, which significantly reduced (by almost half) Zn uptake by root and subsequent translocation to the shoot. AMF inoculation (high glomalin secretion)-mediated low Zn uptake might have been stimulatory to promote root and shoot growth in fenugreek. The results highlight significant protective roles of rhizospheric AMF through glomalin secretion thereby ameliorating nanotoxicity in plants, and underscore the need to include soil-microbial interactions when assessing nanophytotoxicology and risks.

They exhibited a reduction in chlorophyll levels and growth rate when 2,4-DCP solutions were ≥30\\xa0mgL<sup>-1</sup> and ≥50\\xa0mgL<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The removal of contaminant was dose-depended, being 99.7% at 1.5-3\\xa0mgL<sup>-1</sup>, 59-70% at 10-70\\xa0mgL<sup>-1</sup> and 35-42% at 100-300\\xa0mgL<sup>-1</sup> of 2,4-DCP in the solution. Studies indicated that 2,4-DCP was mainly accumulated in root tissue rather than in shoot tissue. Acid hydrolysis of biomass extracts suggests 2,4-DCP bioconjugates formation in root tissue as a response mechanism. Additionally, an increment in glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity could indicate a 2,4-DCP conjugation with glutathione as a detoxification mechanism of T.\\xa0latifolia.', 28161626: 'Alteration of a bacteriocin-producing hydrophilic bacterium, Lactococcus lactis IO-1, into a hydrophobic material with potential antimicrobial activity using chitosan was investigated and compared with five other bacterial species with industrial importance. The negatively charged bacterial cells were neutralized by positively charged chitosan, resulting in a significant increase in the hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell surface. The largest Gram-positive B. megaterium ATCC 14581 showed a moderate response to chitosan while the smaller E. coli DH5α, L. lactis IO-1 and P. putida F1 exhibited a significant response to an increase in chitosan concentration. Because L. lactis IO-1 is a good source for natural peptide lantibiotic that is highly effective against several strains of food spoilage organisms and pathogens, hydrophobic material derived from L. lactis IO-1 and chitosan is a promising novel material with antimicrobial activity for the food and pharmaceutical industries.', 28167356: 'An aerobic marine bacterium Vibrio sp. Y1-5 was screened to achieve efficient nitrate and ammonium removal simultaneously and fix nitrogen in cells without N loss. Approximately 98.0% of nitrate (100mg/L) was removed in 48h through assimilatory nitrate reduction and nitrate reductase was detected in the cytoplasm. Instead of nitrification, the strain assimilated ammonium directly, and it could tolerate as high as 1600mg/L ammonium concentration while removing 844.6mg/L. In addition, ammonium assimilation occurred preferentially in the medium containing nitrate and ammonium with a total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of 80.4%. The results of nitrogen balance and Fourier infrared spectra illustrated that the removed nitrogen was all transformed to protein or stored as organic nitrogen substances in cells and no N was lost in the process. Toxicological studies with the brine shrimp species Artemia naupliia indicated that Vibrio sp. Y1-5 can be applied in aquatic ecosystems safely.', 28185023: 'A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was used to test the nitrogen removal performance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) in presence of organic matter. Mesophilic operation (30\\xa0±\\xa00.5\\xa0°C) was performed with influent pH 7.5. The results showed, independent of organic matter species, ANAMMOX reaction was promoted when COD was lower than 80\\xa0mg/L. However, specific ANAMMOX activity decreased with increasing organic matter content. Ammonium removal efficiency decreased to 80% when COD of sodium succinate, sodium potassium tartrate, peptone and lactose were 192.5, 210, 225 and 325\\xa0mg/L, respectively. The stoichiometry ratio resulting from different OM differed largely and R<sub>1</sub> could be as an indicator for OM inhibition. When COD concentration was 240\\xa0mg/L, the loss of SAA resulting from lactose, peptone, sodium potassium tartrate and sodium succinate were 28, 36, 50 and 55%, respectively. Sodium succinate had the highest inhibitory effect on SAA.

Citric acid, fulvic acid, and humic acid, in the order of increasing MWs, were selected to represent DOM. The results showed that DOM with larger MWs had stronger inhibitory effects on the bioavailability of Cu to algae. However, the biosorption isotherm of Pb in the presence of DOM was different: as Pb equilibrium concentration increased, the biosorption capacity increased sharply to a maximum, then decreased. The maximum values ranged between 0.186 and 0.398\\xa0mmol\\xa0g<sup>-1</sup>, as the solution DOM concentration and MW changed, exhibiting a stoichiometric relationship between DOM, Pb and algae. The ternary complex of Pb-DOM-alga formed in a limited Pb concentration range, and increased the percentage of internalized Pb.

Despite regulatory implications of this hypothesis, limited data exist on influences of copper-exposures on MC-degrading bacteria and consequent MC-degradation. In this study, influences of copper-algaecide concentrations and formulations on bacterial composition and microcystin-LR (MCLR) degradation were investigated. Microcystis aeruginosa was exposed to four concentrations (0-5.0\\xa0mg Cu\\xa0L<sup>-1</sup>) of three copper-algaecide formulations, and rates and extents of MCLR degradation were measured. In untreated controls and following exposures of 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0\\xa0mg Cu\\xa0L<sup>-1</sup>, MCLR concentrations decreased at a rate of ∼41-53\\xa0μg MCLR/L\\xa0d<sup>-1</sup>. Following exposure to 5.0\\xa0mg Cu\\xa0L<sup>-1</sup> MCLR degradation rates decreased an order of magnitude to ∼3-7\\xa0μg MCLR/L\\xa0d<sup>-1</sup>. Bacterial diversity decreased following copper-exposures greater than 0.1\\xa0mg Cu\\xa0L<sup>-1</sup> for all formulations. Relative abundance of certain groups of MC-degrading bacteria identified in treatments increased with increasing copper concentration, suggesting they may be less sensitive to copper exposures than other, MCLR and non MC-degrading heterotrophic bacteria present in the assemblage. Results from this study revealed that copper concentration can influence degradation rates of MCLR, however this influence was not significant within copper concentrations currently registered for use (≤1.0\\xa0mg Cu\\xa0L<sup>-1</sup>) of the tested algaecides. Copper formulation did not significantly alter degradation rates or bacterial composition. These data augment our understanding of the influences of copper algaecide-exposures on MCLR degradation, and can be used to inform more accurate risk evaluations and use of copper-algaecides for management of MCLR-producing cyanobacteria.', 28196686: 'The present study used strain ZH-H2 (Fusarium sp.) isolated by our group as the PAH-degrading strain and 5-6-rings PAHs as degradation objects. The soil incubation experiment was carried out to investigate the starch-enhanced degradation effects of HMW PAHs by Fusarium sp. in an Aged Polluted Soil from a Coal Mining Area. The results showed that the removal rates of BaP, InP and BghiP increased with increasing inoculation rate of ZH-H2 in the unsterile aged polluted soil of coal mining area, with the exception of BbF degradation which increased in the H2 treatment and then decreased. Different addition dosage of starch apparently resulted in degradation of 4 PAHs in soil, with removal rates of 14.47% for BaP, 23.83% for DbA, 30.77% for BghiP and 31.00% for InP obtained with treatment D2, respectively higher than in treatment D1. So starch addition apparently enhanced the degradation of the 4 PAHs, especially InP and BghiP, by native microbes in the aged HMW PAH-polluted soil. By adding starch to these aged polluted soils with inoculated strain ZH-H2, HMW-PAHs degradation was further improved and addition of 0.5\\xa0g\\xa0kg<sup>-1</sup> starch to soils with 1.0\\xa0g\\xa0kg<sup>-1</sup> Fusarium ZH-H2 (D<sub>2</sub>\\xa0+\\xa0H<sub>2</sub>) performed best to the 4 HMW-PAHs in all of these combination treatments by a factor of up to 3.09, depending on the PAH. We found that the highest polyphenol oxidase activities under D<sub>2</sub>\\xa0+\\xa0H<sub>2</sub> treatments are consistent with the results of removal rates of 4 PAHs. Our findings suggest that the combination of Fusarium sp.

After 45days of 1dosage (0.3g dry cell weight L<sup>-1</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>, DCW L<sup>-1</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>) of bioaugmentation, the average volumetric methane production (VMP), methane recovery rate and propionic acid (HPr) degradation rate was enhanced by 70mLL<sup>-1</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>, 21% and 51%, respectively. In contrast, the non-bioaugmentation reactor almost failed. Routine addition of a double dosage (0.6g DCW L<sup>-1</sup>d<sup>-1</sup>) of bioaugmentation culture was able to effectively recover the failing digester. The results of FISH suggested that the populations of Methanosaetaceae increased significantly, which could be a main contributor for the positive effect on methane production.', 28243605: 'Weathering processes change properties and composition of spilled oil, representing the main reason of failure of bioaugmentation strategies. Our purpose was to investigate the metabolic adaptation of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria at harsh conditions to be considered to overcome the limitations of bioaugmentation strategies at harsh conditions. Polluted soils, exposed for prolonged periods to weathered oil in harsh soils and weather conditions, were used. Two types of enrichment cultures were employed using 5% and 10% oil or diesel as sole carbon sources with varying the mineral nitrogen sources and C/N ratios. The most effective isolates were obtained based on growth, tolerance to toxicity, and removal efficiency of diesel hydrocarbons. Activities of the newly isolated bacteria, in relation to the microenvironment from where they were isoalted and their interaction with the weathered oil, showed individual specific ability to adapt when exposed to such factors, to acquire metabolic potentialities. Among 39 isolates, ten identified ones by 16S rDNA genes similarities, including special two <i>Pseudomonas</i> isolates and one <i>Citrobacter</i> isolate, showed particularity of shifting hydrocarbon-degrading ability from short chain <i>n</i>-alkanes (<i>n</i>-C12-<i>n</i>-C16) to longer chain <i>n</i>-alkanes (<i>n</i>-C21-<i>n</i>-C25) and vice versa by alternating nitrogen source compositions and C/N ratios.

The photocatalytic activity of ZrO NPs was studied for azo dye by exposing to sunlight. The azo dye was degraded up to 94.58%. Also the ZrO NPs were studied for in vitro cytotoxicity activity against breast cancer cell lines-MCF-7 and evaluated by MTT assay. The cell morphological changes were recorded by light microscope. The cells viability was seen at 500μg/mL when compared against control. Hence the research highlights, that the method was simple, eco-friendly towards environment by phytoremediation activity of the azo dye and cytotoxicity activity against MCF-7 cell lines.

However, these cultures are rarely characterized kinetically at environmentally relevant concentrations. This study investigated the kinetics of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation by Achromobacter denitrificans strain PR1 at a wide range of concentrations, from ng/L to mg/L, to assess the feasibility of using it for bioaugmentation purposes. Complete removal of SMX occurred for all concentrations tested, i.e., 150\\xa0mg/L, 500\\xa0µg/L, 20\\xa0µg/L, and 600\\xa0ng/L. The reaction rate coefficients (k<sub>bio</sub>) for the strain at the ng/L SMX range were: 63.4\\xa0±\\xa08.6, 570.1\\xa0±\\xa015.1 and 414.9\\xa0±\\xa0124.2 L/g[Formula: see text]·day), for tests fed without a supplemental carbon source, with acetate, and with succinate, respectively. These results were significantly higher than the value reported for non-augmented activated sludge (0.41 L/(g\\xa0[Formula: see text]·day) with hundreds of ng/L of SMX. The simultaneous consumption of an additional carbon source and SMX suggested that the energetic efficiency of the cells, boosted by the presence of biogenic substrates, was important in increasing the SMX degradation rate. The accumulation of 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole was observed as the only metabolite, which was found to be non-toxic.

We disrupted all Pi and organic Pi transporters in an Escherichia coli strain expressing HtxABCDE and a Pt dehydrogenase, leaving Pt/HPt uptake and oxidation as the only means to obtain Pi.

Solar-illuminated titanium dioxide can be used to photocatalytically degrade aqueous tetracycline, but its application in a lagoon environment requires that the photocatalyst be supported on a macroscopic support material to prevent loss of the nanoscale photocatalyst into the environment. In this work, titanium dioxide was deposited within a porous poly(methyl methacrylate) film on the surface of floating 7.0 cm diameter acrylic spheres. Six of these floating spheres removed over 96% of the tetracycline in 3.5 L of 60 mg/L tetracycline in natural pond water during 24 hours of solar illumination. The durability of these spheres under long-term solar exposure was also investigated along with the amount of photocatalyst lost from the sphere surface during use. These macroscale floating composite spheres provide a new method for removing tetracycline from wastewater lagoons with minimal risk of being displaced in the environment due to the large size of the spheres.', 28391491: \"Different inoculum sources and acclimatization methods result in different substrate adaptation and biodegradability. To increase straw degradation rate, shorten the digester start-up time, and enhance the biogas production, we domesticated anaerobic sludge by adding microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). During acclimatization, the start-up strategies and reactor performance were investigated to analyze changes in feedstock adaption, biodegradability, and methanogen activity. The effect of the domesticated inoculum was evaluated by testing batch un-pretreated corn stover with a dewatered sludge (DS)-domesticated inoculum as a control. The results showed that (1) using MCC as a substrate rapidly improved microorganism biodegradability and adaptation. (2) MCC as domesticated substrate has relatively stable system and high mass conversion, but with low buffer capacity. (3) Macro- and micronutrients should be added for improving the activity of methanogenic and system's buffer capacity. (4) Using the domesticated inoculums and batch tests to anaerobically digest untreated corn stover yielded rapid biogas production of 292\\xa0mL, with an early peak value on the first day.

To solve this problem, a Fenton-like system consisting of nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) and hydrogen peroxide was used for further oxidation of the metabolites after biodegradation. Results showed that the total COD removal increased from 56.8% to 89% under the optimal condition.

The relative composition of acid rain is changing gradually from sulfuric acid rain (SAR) to nitric acid rain (NAR) with the rapidly growing amount of nitrogen deposition. In this study, we investigated the impact of simulated SAR and NAR on litter decomposition and the soil microbial community over four seasons since March 2015. Results first showed that the effects of acid rain on litter decomposition and soil microbial were positive in the early period of the experiment, except for SAR on soil microbes. Second, soil pH with NAR decreased more rapidly with the amount of acid rain increased in summer than with SAR treatments. Only strongly acid rain (both SAR and NAR) was capable of depressing litter decomposition and its inhibitory effect was stronger on leaf than on fine root litter. Meanwhile, NAR had a higher inhibitory effect on litter decomposition than SAR. Third, in summer, autumn and winter, PLFAs were negatively impacted by the increased acidity level resulting from both SAR and NAR. However, higher acidity level of NAR (pH=2.5) had the strongest inhibitory impact on soil microbial activity, especially in summer. In addition, Gram-negative bacteria (cy19:0) and fungi (18:1ω9) were more sensitive to both SAR and NAR, and actinomycetes was more sensitive to SAR intensity. Finally, soil total carbon, total nitrogen and pH were the most important soil property factors affecting soil microbial activity, and high microbial indices (fungi/bacteria) with high soil pH.

For the purpose of comparison, E1 was fed with synthetic antibiotic industry wastewater with CFX added as the test reactor, while, E2 was fed without any CFX added as the control reactor (E2). The addition of CFX resulted in the continual increasing of soluble COD (sCOD) and accumulation of VFAs in the effluent of E1 system. Besides, it was found that the accumulation of CFX by-products D-1, D-2 and D-3 was negative correlation with sCOD removal efficiency. Furthermore, the microbial community structures were also investigated. For the bacterial community, Gelria and Syntrophorhabdus which can ferment propionate and other organic pollutants as their substrate were obviously enriched in E1 system.

Biomass production of the plant, evapotranspiration amount of the soil, metals accumulation in plant organs and the volume of leachate under various treatments were compared. Relative to the planting control, EDTA application shortened the time required for Cd, Pb and Cu decontamination by 1.7-5.5 times but led to significantly more leachate (996 vs 1256\\xa0mL), indicating the negative influence of the chelate treatment on the species and the surrounding environment. The foliar application of cytokinin can expand the advantage and alleviate the adverse impact of individual EDTA application simultaneously as manifested by the increased biomass yield, less time consumption for purification and decreased leachate volume. Cytokinin accelerated the transpiration rate of the plant proved by the least volume of leachate in individual cytokinin treatment. The major factors for effective phytoremediation were the resistance of species to high concentrations of contaminants and less environmental risks generation during the remediation processes.

Thus, a biological oxidation of a diluted WW is carried out by using the activated sludge process. Activated sludge was gradually acclimated to the Diluted Winery Wastewater (DWW). Some aspects concerning the biological process were evaluated (kinetics of the oxidation and sedimentation of the sludge produced). The biological treatment of the DWW led to a 40-50% of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal in 8\\xa0h, being necessary the application of an additional process. Different chemical processes combining UVA-LEDs radiation, monoperoxysulfate (MPS) and photocatalysts were applied in order to complete the COD depletion and efficient removal of polyphenols content, poorly oxidized in the previous biological step. From the options tested, the combination of UVA, MPS and a novel LaCoO<sub>3</sub>-TiO<sub>2</sub> composite, with double route of MPS decomposition through heterogeneous catalysis and photocatalysis, led to the best results (95% of polyphenol degradation, and additional 60% of COD removal). Initial MPS concentration and pH effect in this process were assessed.', 29195092: 'Dehalococcoides spp. were extensively studied and applied to in-situ trichloroethylene (TCE) remediation since it is the only genus that can reduce TCE to harmless ethene completely. However, this technology was hindered because of the requirement of electron donor (i.e. hydrogen or fermentable organic substrate). Considering the spontaneous electric field and in-situ hydrogen production capacity of tourmaline, this mineral was used as an environmental-friendly bio-promoter for dechlorinating mixed culture containing Dehalococcoides spp. in this work. Research results showed that biodegradation of TCE and the intermediates were both significantly improved by tourmaline. The first-order TCE degradation rate coefficient increased from 0.0125 h<sup>-1</sup> for the tourmaline-free system to 0.0306 h<sup>-1</sup> for the system combined with 5\\xa0g\\xa0L<sup>-1</sup> tourmaline, and ethene production increased by 36%. The outstanding TCE-degrading ability in the tourmaline-bacteria system without the addition of fermentative electron donor (i.e. methanol) indicated that tourmaline could also produce electron donor to support dechlorinating bacteria. Tourmaline could have direct electric biostimulatory effect and indirect enhanced effect associated with water-derived H<sub>2</sub> production in the electric field of tourmaline. Meanwhile, PCR-DGGE analysis exhibited that tourmaline could accelerate the succession of a bacterial, dechlorinating community. The distinctive effects of tourmaline on bacteria were related to its stable electric properties. Therefore, tourmaline could be continuously used in the bioremediation. The present study provided a safe, convenient and persistent alternative to the commonly used enhancement approaches for anaerobic reductive dechlorination process.', 29197791: 'Although biochar has great potential for heavy metal removal from sediments or soils, its impact on arsenic biogeochemistry in contaminated paddy fields remains poorly characterized. In this study, anaerobic microcosms were established with arsenic-contaminated paddy soil to investigate arsenic transformation as well as the potentially active microbial community and their transcriptional activities in the presence of biochar. The results demonstrated that biochar can simultaneously stimulate microbial reduction of As(V) and Fe(III), releasing high levels of As(III) into the soil solution relative to the control. Total RNAs were extracted to profile the potentially active microbial communities, which suggested that biochar increased the abundance of arsenic- and iron-related bacteria, such as Geobacter, Anaeromyxobacter and Clostridium compared to the control. Reverse transcription, quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that the abundance of Geobacter transcripts were significantly stimulated by biochar throughout the incubation. Furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed between the abundance of Geobacter transcripts and As(V) concentrations, and between that of Clostridium transcripts and Fe(III) concentrations in biochar-amended microcosms. Our findings suggest that biochar can stimulate the activity of metal-reducing bacteria to promote arsenic mobility. The Geobacter may contribute to As(V) reduction in the presence of biochar, while Clostridium has a role in Fe(III) reduction.', 29236193: 'In this study, the effects of ammonium nitrogen concentration, algae biomass concentration, and light conditions (wavelength and intensity) on the ammonium removal efficiency of algae-bacteria consortia from wastewater were investigated. The results indicated that ammonium concentration and light intensity had a significant impact on nitrification. It was found that the highest ammonia concentration (430\\xa0mg\\xa0N/L) in the influent resulted in the highest ammonia removal rate of 108\\xa0±\\xa03.6 mg\\xa0N/L/days, which was two times higher than the influent with low ammonia concentration (40\\xa0mg\\xa0N/L). At the lowest light intensity of 1000 Lux, algae biomass concentration, light wavelength, and light cycle did not show a significant effect on the performance of algal-bacterial consortium. Furthermore, the ammonia removal rate was approximately 83\\xa0±\\xa01.0\\xa0mg\\xa0N/L/days, which was up to 40% faster than at the light intensity of 2500 Lux. It was concluded that the algae-bacteria consortia can effectively remove nitrogen from wastewater and the removal performance can be stabilized and enhanced using the low light intensity of 1000 Lux that is also a cost-effective strategy.', 29236851: 'High toxicity of the preservatives most frequently used in wood treatment and the resulting risks of handling pose a threat to small producers and to the environment. In an attempt to mitigate these problems, the present study was conducted with the objective of evaluating the preservative effect of tannic extract on biodeterioration of Acacia mearnsii wood. For this purpose, untreated and preserved specimens, some with tannin extract and some with a preservative mixture based on CCB (Chromated Copper Borate), were submitted to accelerated rotting trials with the fungus that causes white rot (Pycnoporus sanguineus) for 16 weeks. The evaluations were made with a basis on weight loss and chemical components analysis, and they showed that the natural resistance of Acacia wood is moderate when exposed to the white rot fungus. The tannin concentrations showed similar effects to those of the CBB mixture in all evaluations, i.e., they significantly increased the biological resistance of the material, which started to be classified as very resistant to the fungus. Overall, the results suggest that tannin can be considered as a potential natural preservative product.', 29359253: 'Phytoremediation of polluted sites can be improved by co-inoculation with mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi. In this study, the effects of single- and co-inoculation of Lactuca serriola with an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus, Rhizoglomus intraradices, and endophytic fungi, Mucor sp. or Trichoderma asperellum, on plant growth, vitality, toxic metal accumulation, sesquiterpene lactone production and flavonoid concentration in the presence of toxic metals were evaluated. Inoculation with the AM fungus increased biomass yield of the plants grown on non-polluted and polluted substrate. Co-inoculation with the AM fungus and Mucor sp. resulted in increased biomass yield of plants cultivated on the polluted substrate, whereas co-inoculation with T. asperellum and the AM fungus increased plant biomass on the non-polluted substrate. In the presence of Mucor sp., mycorrhizal colonization and arbuscule richness were increased in the non-polluted substrate. Co-inoculation with the AM fungus and Mucor sp. increased Zn concentration in leaves and roots. The concentration of sesquiterpene lactones in plant leaves was decreased by AM fungus inoculation in both substrates. Despite enhanced host plant costs caused by maintaining symbiosis with numerous microorganisms, interaction of wild lettuce with both mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi was more beneficial than that with a single fungus. The study shows the potential of double inoculation in unfavourable environments, including agricultural areas and toxic metal-polluted areas.', 29384200: 'Mercury tolerant bacteria Pseudarthrobacter oxydans strain MM20 and Pseudomonas frederiksbergensis strain SS18 were isolated from the tundra ecosystem of Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, where commercial exploitation of the coal existed till 1960s. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), mercury removal, mercury biosorption, and antibiotic resistance of these strains were analyzed. P. frederiksbergensis strain SS18 showed high tolerance (2.0\\u2009ppm) to mercury than P. oxydans strain MM20 (1.5\\u2009ppm). Mercury removal and biosorption studies were carried out in liquid media containing 1.0\\u2009ppm mercury. More than 90% of mercury was removed from the culture media by the selected strains. The mercury biosorption assay revealed that a part of mercury was accumulated in cell pellets and was 22 and 25% respectively for P. oxydans strain MM20 and P. frederiksbergensis strain SS18. Fourier transform infrared study revealed that alkyl halide, alkynes, alcoholic, aliphatic and aromatic amines, alkanes, nitro compound, primary amines, carboxylic acid, alkenes, and amide groups play a major role in the development of tolerance towards mercury. Out of eleven antibiotics tested, P. oxydans strain MM20 was found to be resistant to lincomycin and novobiocin while P. frederiksbergensis strain SS18 was found to be resistant to seven antibiotics. Our study demonstrates that under experimental conditions, bacterial isolates undergo detailed structural and functional changes to tolerate as well as immobilize toxic elements like mercury.', 29414752: 'Natural and cost-effective materials such as minerals can serve as supportive matrices to enhance biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this study we evaluated and compared the regulatory role of two common soil minerals, i.e. kaolinite and quartz in phenanthrene (a model PAH) degradation by a PAH degrader Sphingomonas sp. GY2B and investigated the underlying mechanism. Overall kaolinite was more effective than quartz in promoting phenanthrene degradation and bacterial growth. And it was revealed that a more intimate association was established between GY2B and kaolinite. Si and O atoms on mineral surface were demonstrated to be involved in GY2B-mineral interaction. There was an higher polysaccharide/lipid content in the EPS (extracellular polymeric substances) secreted by GY2B on kaolinite than on quartz. Altogether, these results showed that differential bacterial growth, enzymatic activity, EPS composition as well as the interface interaction may explain the effects minerals have on PAH biodegradation. It was implicated that different interface interaction between different minerals and bacteria can affect microbial behavior, which ultimately results in different biodegradation efficiency.', 29454971: 'Mercury (Hg) is a highly biotoxic heavy metal that contaminates the environment. Phytoremediation is a green technology for environmental remediation and is used to clean up Hg contaminated soil in recent years. In this study, we isolated an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene PtABCC1 from Populus trichocarpa and overexpressed it in Arabidopsis and poplar. The transgenic plants conferred higher Hg tolerance than wild type (WT) plants, and overexpression of PtABCC1 could lead to 26-72% or 7-160% increase of Hg accumulation in Arabidopsis or poplar plants, respectively. These results demonstrated that PtABCC1 plays a crucial role in enhancing tolerance and accumulation to Hg in plants, which provides a promising way for phytoremediation of Hg contamination.', 29462763: 'Titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles have been applied in diverse commercial products, which could lead to toxic effects on aquatic microbes and would inhibit some important ecosystem processes. The study aimed to investigate the chronic impacts of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles with different concentrations (5, 50, and 500\\u202fmg\\u202fL<sup>-1</sup>) on Populus nigra L. leaf decomposition in the freshwater ecosystem. After 50\\u202fd of decomposing, a significant decrease in decomposition rates was observed with higher concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. During the period of litter decomposition, exposure of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles led to decreases in extracellular enzyme activities, which was caused by the reduction of microbial especially fungal biomass. In addition, the diversity and composition of the fungal community associated with litter decomposition were strongly affected by the concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. The diversity and composition of the fungal community associated with litter decomposition was strongly affected. The abundance of Tricladium chaetocladium decreased with the increasing concentrations of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, indicating the little contribution of the species to the litter decomposition. In conclusion, this study provided the evidence for the chronic exposure effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles on the litter decomposition and further the functions of freshwater ecosystems.', 29463058: 'In recent decades, environmental pollution has emerged as a core issue, around the globe, rendering it of fundamental concern to eco-toxicologists, environmental biologists, eco-chemists, pathologists, and researchers from other fields. The dissolution of polluting agents is a leading cause of environmental pollution of all key spheres including the hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere, among others. The widespread occurrence of various pollutants including toxic heavy metals and other emerging hazardous contaminants is a serious concern. With increasing scientific knowledge, socioeconomic awareness, human health problems, and ecological apprehensions, people are more concerned about adverse health outcomes. Against this background, several removal methods have been proposed and implemented with the aim of addressing environmental pollution and sustainable and eco-friendly development. Among them, the biosorption of pollutants using naturally inspired sources, e.g., marine algae, has considerable advantages. In the past few years, marine algae have been extensively studied due to their natural origin, overall cost-effective ratio, and effectiveness against a broader pollutant range; thus, they are considered a potential alternative to the conventional methods used for environmental decontamination. Herein, an effort has been made to highlight the importance of marine algae as naturally inspired biosorbents and their role in biosorption. Biosorption mechanisms and factors affecting biosorption activities are also discussed in this review. The utilization of marine algae as a biosorbent for the removal of numerous potentially toxic elements has also been reviewed.', 29494906: 'Hydroponics experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different levels of Pb on Para Grass (Brachiaria mutica) and Castorbean (Ricinus communis L). Generally, Para Grass exhibited higher tolerance to excessive concentrations of Pb in nutrient solution, whereas a consistent decline was observed in growth of Castorbean plants exposed to similar Pb levels. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> contents exhibited contrasting results with a general decrease in Para Grass and a linear increase in case of Castorbean. In both species a decrease was noticed in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and guaiacol peroxidase (G-POD) while catalase (CAT) activity was significantly increased. Ultrastructural studies revealed increased starch grains and adversely affected thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts of leaf cells of plants treated with 500\\u202fμM\\u202fPb. Photosynthetic parameters such as CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate, stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (E) decreased in both plant species under different levels of Pb. Maximum concentrations of Pb in shoots of Para Grass and Castorbean were 1.29 and 0.352\\u202fg\\u202fkg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively while in roots maximum values were 8.88 and 49.86\\u202fg\\u202fkg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The high concentrations of Pb (about 5%) in the roots of Castorbean plants suggest its possible role in the phytoremediation/rhizofiltration of Pb contaminated water.', 29672237: 'In this study, m-xylene biodegradation was examined in bacteria-water mixed solution and biotrickling filter (BTF) systems amended with the nonionic surfactant Tween 80. The mixed bacteria were obtained from the activated sludge of a coking plant through a multisubstrate acclimatization process. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that Rhodanobacter sp. was the dominant species among the mixed bacteria. In the bacteria-water mixed solution, the bacterial density increased with increasing Tween 80 concentration. Hence, Tween 80 could be utilized as substrate by the mixed bacteria. Tween 80, with concentrations of 50-100\\xa0mg L<sup>-1</sup>, could enhance the bioavailability of m-xylene and consequently improve the degradation efficiency of m-xylene. However, further increasing the initial concentration of Tween 80 would decrease the degradation efficiency of m-xylene. At concentrations exceeding 100\\xa0mg L<sup>-1</sup>, Tween 80 was preferentially degraded by the mixed bacteria over m-xylene. In BTF systems, when the m-xylene inlet concentration was 1200\\xa0mg m<sup>-3</sup> and the empty bed residence time was 20\\xa0sec, the removal efficiency and elimination capacity of BTF1 with Tween 80 addition were at most 20% and 24% higher than those of BTF2 without Tween 80 addition. Overall, the integrated application of the mixed bacteria and surfactant was demonstrated to be a highly effective strategy for m-xylene waste gas treatment.', 29689089: 'The concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contents in the environment have been rising due to human activities. Elevated CO2 (eCO2) levels have been shown to affect plant physiology and soil microbes, which may alter the degradation of organic pollutants. Here, we study the effect of eCO2 on PAH accumulation in a paddy soil grown with rice. We collected soil and plant samples after rice harvest from a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) system, which had already run for more than 15 years. Our results show that eCO2 increased PAH concentrations in the soil, and we link this effect to a shift in soil microbial community structure and function. Elevated CO2 changed the composition of soil microbial communities, especially by reducing the abundance of some microbial groups driving PAH degradation. Our study indicates that elevated CO2 levels may weaken the self-cleaning ability of soils related to organic pollutants. Such changes in the function of soil microbial communities may threaten the quality of crops, with unknown implications for food safety and human health in future climate scenarios.', 29695081: 'Once applied, an herbicide first makes contact with leaves and soil. It is known that photolysis can be one of the most important processes of dissipation of herbicides in the field. However, degradation does not guarantee detoxification and can give rise to byproducts that could be more toxic and/or persistent than the active substance. In this work, the photodegradation of alloxydim herbicide in soil and leaf cuticle surrogates was studied and a detailed study on the phytotoxicity of the main byproduct on sugar beet, tomato, and rotational crops was performed. Quantitative structure⁻activity relationship (QSAR) models were used to obtain a first approximation of the possible ecotoxicological and environmental implications of the alloxydim and its degradation product. The results show that alloxydim is rapidly degraded on carnauba and sandy loam soil surfaces, two difficult matrices to analyze and not previously studied with alloxydim. Two transformation products that formed in both matrices were identified: alloxydim Z-isomer and imine derivative (mixture of two tautomers). The phytotoxicity of alloxydim and the major byproduct shows that tomato possesses high sensitivity to the imine byproduct, while wheat crops are inhibited by the parent compound. This paper demonstrates the need to further investigate the behavior of herbicide degradation products on target and nontarget species to determine the adequate use of herbicidal products to maximize productivity in the context of sustainable agriculture.', 29751036: 'Ginger peroxidase (GP) was entrapped into the hydrogels of guar gum (GG)-alginate/agarose and these immobilized GP preparations were employed for the treatment of textile effluent. GG is a natural hydrophilic polysaccharide, the average size of which increases in its hydrated form that helps in retaining the enzyme inside the entrapping support. Therefore, the activity retention by alginate-guar gum (ANGG) and agarose-guar gum (AGG) was higher than that of alginate and agarose alone. ANGG-GP and AGG-GP were highly stable against various physical and chemical denaturants during the decolorization of textile effluent. As compared to free GP, both the immobilized preparations were more efficient in the decolorization of textile effluent in batch processes. After 10th repeated use in batch processes, ANGG-GP and AGG-GP was quite effective in removing up to 68% and 55% of the color from textile effluent, respectively. Continuous packed bed reactors containing ANGG-GP and AGG-GP were able to decolorize around 80% and 69% of the effluent color, respectively, even after 30\\u202fdays of their continuous operation at room temperature (30\\u202f°C). Genotoxicity of textile effluent was significantly reduced after GP mediated decolorization.', 29789525: 'Straw, mainly dry stalks of crops, is an agricultural byproduct. Its incorporation to soils via microbial redistribution is an environment-friendly way to increase fertility. Fertilization influences soil microorganisms and straw degradation. However, our up to date knowledge on the responses of the straw decomposers to fertilization remains elusive. To this end, inoculated with paddy soils with 26-year applications of chemical fertilizers, organic amendments or controls without fertilization, microcosms were anoxically incubated with <sup>13</sup>C-labelled rice straw amendment. DNA-based stable isotope probing and molecular ecological network analysis were conducted to unravel how straw degrading bacterial species shift in responses to fertilizations, as well as evaluate what their roles/links in the microbiome are. It was found that only a small percentage of the community ecotypes was participating into straw degradation under both fertilizations. Fertilization, especially with organic amendments decreased the predominance of Firmicutes- and Acidobacteria-like straw decomposers but increased those of the copiotrophs, such as β-Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes due to increased soil fertility. For the same reason, fertilization shifted the hub species towards those of high degrading potential and created a more stable and efficient microbial consortium. These findings indicate that fertilization shapes a well-organized community of decomposers for accelerated straw degradation.', 29885626: 'Cadmium (Cd)-contamination of agricultural soils has been receiving attention worldwide due to its entry into food crops such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Little is known regarding the use of organic carbon (OC) sources in alleviating Cd toxicity in cereals. The current experiment was aimed to study the effects of different OC sources on the Cd accumulation by wheat. A pot study was conducted to determine the effects of rice husk biochar (RHB), farmyard manure (FYM), and lignite (LT) either alone or in combination on crop growth, Cd bioavailability and health risk assessment. The results proved that the application of OC sources like RHB, FYM, and LT either alone or in combination were highly effective in enhancing the wheat growth and yield as well as in minimizing the phyto-available fraction of Cd and its transfer to edible tissue of wheat. The RHB was the most efficient source in enhancing the plant growth and reducing the Cd concentration in wheat tissues. RHB increased grain yield by 91% and decreased Cd concentration in shoot, roots, grains, and bioavailable fraction of Cd by 67, 69, 62.5, and 74% than control, respectively. The RHB reduced the daily Cd uptake and health risk index in adults in comparison to control. Overall, where un-amended soil resulted in diminished plant productivity, the application of other OC sources also significantly proved their potential to enhance the dry weight and grain yield, suggesting that these OC sources may be used aiming to minimize the Cd concentration in crops. However, there is still a need to explore the potential of different OC sources in combination with other frequently available amendments for their large scale implementation in metal-contaminated soils.', 29890496: 'In the present study, we investigated the removal of Cr(VI) and the associated bacterial activity in the systems containing Bacillus subtilis BSn5 (B.\\xa0subtilis BSn5) and hematite. The microcalorimetry was used to study the effect of hematite on the normal physiological functions of B.\\xa0subtilis BSn5 towards the removal of Cr(VI) for the first time. The results of the heat flux and the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed that hematite does not affect the normal physiological functions of B.\\xa0subtilis BSn5, and can help the strains maintain their activity in the presence of Cr(VI). More importantly, the relative capacity and intensity of Cr(VI) and total Cr removal by B.\\xa0subtilis BSn5 in the presence of hematite were higher than that in the absence of hematite. The enhancement effect could be associated with their mineral adsorption, biosorption, Fe(II) reduction, bioreduction and immobilization functions. This study demonstrates the possibility of reducing the toxicity of Cr(VI) and enhancing the Cr(VI) removal efficiency in contaminated environments using a combination of hematite and B.\\xa0subtilis BSn5.', 29986221: 'In the present study, stabilized landfill leachate treatment by heterogeneous Fenton and electro-Fenton (EF) was carried out. Iron-manganese binary oxide loaded zeolite (IMZ) was used as a catalyst for generating hydroxyl radicals in the acidic medium. Heterogeneous Fenton process was capable of removing 88.6% COD from landfill leachate at the optimal conditions, while 87.5% COD removal was observed at optimal EF treatment conditions. Biodegradability of landfill leachate was increased significantly from 0.03 to 0.52 after Fenton treatment. The prepared heterogeneous catalyst was found reusable with a reduction in COD removal rate. Even though, both the processes are efficient for leachate treatment, the low catalyst dosage requirement in case of EF process justifies that it is more feasible than Fenton process.', 30029095: 'The ability of anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) and riboflavin to enhance the sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation coupled with the Fe(III) reduction by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 was investigated. The results indicated that the SMX degradation rate was 38.5% with an initial SMX concentration at 0.04\\u202fmM. For the overall performance of AQDS and riboflavin mediated SMX degradation and iron reduction, the SMX degradation rate was gradually increased with the enhancement of iron reduction. Riboflavin had a stronger enhancement on SMX degradation and iron reduction than AQDS, but the enhancement was not positively correlated with electron shuttles concentration. A quantitative characterization of the electron transfer capacity (ETC) of the electron shuttles showed that the ETC was higher for riboflavin than AQDS. The S. oneidensis MR-1 16S rRNA gene copies results indicated that electron shuttles had a positive effect on the microbial activity of S. oneidensis MR-1. The LCMS result indicated that the products of the SMX biodegradation were 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole and 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, which suggested that the SMX biodegradation was caused by SN bond cleavage. This study indicates that the biochemical mechanisms play a vital role in SMX transformation and Fe(II) generation in this system.', 30037006: 'This paper intended to explore the effect of alkaline H₂O₂ pretreatment on the biodegradability and the methane generation potential of greenhouse crop waste. A multi-variable experimental design was implemented. In this approach, initial solid content (3⁻7%), reaction time (6⁻24 h), H₂O₂ concentration (1⁻3%), and reaction temperature (50⁻100 °C) were varied in different combinations to determine the impact of alkaline H₂O₂ pretreatment. The results indicated that the alkaline H₂O₂ pretreatment induced a significant increase in the range of 200⁻800% in chemical oxygen demand (COD) leakage into the soluble phase, and boosted the methane generation potential from 174 mLCH₄/g of volatile solid (VS) to a much higher bracket of 250⁻350 mLCH₄/gVS. Similarly, the lignocellulosic structure of the material was broken down and hydrolyzed by H₂O₂ dosing, which increased the rate of volatile matter utilization from 31% to 50⁻70% depending on selected conditions. Alkaline H₂O₂ pretreatment was optimized to determine optimal conditions for the enhancement of methane generation assuming a cost-driven approach. Optimal alkaline H₂O₂ pretreatment conditions were found as a reaction temperature of 50 °C, 7% initial solid content, 1% H₂O₂ concentration, and a reaction time of six h. Under these conditions, the biochemical methane potential (BMP) test yielded as 309 mLCH₄/gVS. The enhancement of methane production was calculated as 77.6% compared to raw greenhouse crop wastes.', 30064095: \"The wide ranges of uses for acetophenone make it more available and expected to accumulate in the biosphere, where consequently it can threat ecosystems. To remediate this problem, the use of Solanum nigrum L. plants for the clean-up of acetophenone-contaminated sites was explored. Also, plant root and shoot biometry and metabolism where assayed to better understand the effects of this organic compound and to pinpoint possible metabolic pathways to be targeted for future manipulations for increasing this plant species' remediation efficiency. Although undergoing through some stress, detected by increases in ROS and lipid peroxidation in both organs, plants were able to rapidly eliminate all acetophenone from the nutrient solution after 7 days of exposure, being this compound mainly detoxified at the root level. Additionally, acetophenone lead to a differential metabolic response in roots and shoots, where antioxidant mechanisms where differentially activated, while nitrogen assimilation was repressed in shoots and activated in roots. These results confirm that S. nigrum is a good phytoremediation tool for acetophenone and suggest that enhancing shoot GS activity may provide more nitrogen precursors for the synthesis of thiolated proteins and glutathione to increase tolerance to acetophenone in roots and shoots, respectively.\", 30075376: 'The study provided an algal treatment to achieve dual function with antibiotic elimination and CO<sub>2</sub> fixation simultaneously. Two widely used antibiotics, cefradine and amoxicillin were selected as the target compounds. First of all, we assessed the influence of light intensity on algal growth and antibiotic removal efficiency to obtain the optimal light intensity. Secondly, after the algal antibiotic treatment, the CO<sub>2</sub> capture capacities at varied CO<sub>2</sub> volume concentrations were assessed and compared. Significant improvement in the removal efficiency of cefradine occurred when CO<sub>2</sub> was added into the treatment. Change in the content of photosynthetic pigments and the activities of RuBisCO and carbonic anhydrase occurred as the algal responses to the treatment condition. Our results showed that Chlorella pyrenoidosa performed better than Microcystis aeruginosa in both the antibiotic removal efficiency and the CO<sub>2</sub> capture capacity. In the integrated algal treatment, the remove rate of antibiotic has been improved by 30.16% and at the same time, the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption rate has been promoted by 10.94%. Metabolite analyses also revealed the mechanism involved, which proved the crucial role of the algae in the biodegradation of the target antibiotic.', 30077936: \"The rapid pace of industrial, agricultural and anthropogenic activities in the 20<sup>th</sup> century has resulted in contamination of heavy metals across the globe. Arsenic (As) is a ubiquitous, naturally occurring toxic metalloid, contaminating the soil and water and affecting human health in several countries. Several physicochemical methods exist for the cleanup of As contamination but these are expensive and disastrous to microbes and soil. Plant based remediation approaches are low cost and environmentally safe. Hence, extensive biochemical, molecular and genetic experiments have been conducted to understand plants' responses to As stress and have led to the identification of potential genes. The available knowledge needs to be utilized to either reduce As accumulation in crop plants (rice) or to enhance As levels in shoots of hyperaccumulators (Pteris vittata). Gene manipulation using biotechnological tools can be an effective approach to exploit the potential genes (plasmamembrane and vacuolar transporters, glutathione and phytochelatin biosynthetic enzymes, etc.) playing pivotal roles in uptake, translocation, transformation, complexation, and compartmentalization of As in plants. The transgenic plants with increased tolerance to As and altered (increased/decreased) As accumulation have been developed. The need, however, exists to design plants with altered expression of two or more genes for harmonizing various events (like arsenate reduction, arsenite complexation, sequestration and translocation) so as to achieve desirable reduction (crop plants) or increase (phytoremediator plants) in As content. This review sheds light on transgenic approaches adopted to modulate As levels in plants and proposes future directions to achieve desirable results.\", 30077937: 'The biological agents have been utilized as an affordable alternative to conventional costly metal remediation technologies for last few years. The present investigation introduces arsenic (As) resistant plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) isolated from the As-contaminated agricultural field of West Bengal, India that alleviates arsenic-induced toxicity and exhibited many plant growth promoting traits (PGP). The isolated strain designated as AS6 has identified as Bacillus aryabhattai based on phenotypic characteristics, physio-biochemical tests, MALDI-TOFMS bio-typing, FAME analysis and 16S rDNA sequence homology. The strain found to exhibit five times more resistance to arsenate than arsenite with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) being 100\\u202fmM and 20\\u202fmM respectively. The result showed that accumulation of As was evidenced by SEM- EDAX, TEM-EDAX studies. The intracellular accumulation of arsenic was also confirmed as in bacterial biomass by AAS, FTIR, XRD and XRF analyses. The increased rate of As (V) reduction by this strain found to be exploited for the remediation of arsenic in the contaminated agricultural field. The strain also found to exhibit important PGP traits viz., ACC deaminase activity (2022\\u202fnmol α-ketobutyrate/mg protein/h), IAA production (166\\u202fμg/ml), N<sub>2</sub> fixation (0.32\\u202fμgN fixed/h/mg proteins) and siderophore production (72%) etc. Positive influenced of AS6 strain on rice seedlings growth promotion under As stress was observed considering the several morphological, biochemical parameters including antioxidants activities as compared with an uninoculated set. Thus this strain might be exploited for stress amelioration and plant growth enhancement of rice cultivar under arsenic spiked agricultural soil.', 30097751: 'The dechlorinating Dehalococcoides mccartyi species requires acetate as carbon source, but little is known on its growth under acetate limiting conditions. In this study, we observed growth and dechlorination of a D. mccartyi-containing mixed consortium in a fixed-carbon-free medium with trichloroethene in the aqueous phase and H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> in the headspace. Around 4\\xa0mM formate was produced by day 40, while acetate was constantly below 0.05\\xa0mM. Microbial community analysis of the consortium revealed dominance by D. mccartyi and Desulfovibrio sp. (57 and 22% 16S rRNA gene copies, respectively). From this consortium, Desulfovibrio sp. strain F1 was isolated and found to produce formate and acetate (1.2\\xa0mM and 48\\xa0µM, respectively, by day 24) when cultivated alone in the above mentioned medium without trichloroethene. An established co-culture of strain F1 and D. mccartyi strain 195 demonstrated that strain 195 could grow and dechlorinate using acetate produced by strain F1; and that acetate was constantly below 25\\xa0µM in the co-culture. To verify that such low level of acetate is utilizable by D. mccartyi, we cultivated strain 195 alone under acetate-limiting conditions and found that strain 195 consumed acetate to below detection (5\\xa0µM). Based on the acetate consumption and cell yield of D. mccartyi, we estimated that on average 1.2\\u2009×\\u200910<sup>8</sup> acetate molecules are needed to supply carbon for one D. mccartyi cell. Our study suggests that Desulfovibrio may supply a steady but low amount of fixed carbon to dechlorinating bacteria, exhibiting important implications for natural bio-attenuation when fixed carbon is limited.', 30144671: 'This study investigated the applicability of synthesized calcium peroxide (CaO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles for naphthalene bioremediation by permeable reactive barrier (PRB) from groundwater. According to the batch experiments the application of 400\\u202fmg/L of CaO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles was the optimum concentration for naphthalene (20\\u202fmg/L) bioremediation. Furthermore, the effect of environmental conditions on the stability of nanoparticles showed the tremendous impacts of the initial pH and temperature on the stability and oxygen releasing potential of CaO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, raising the initial pH from 3 to 12 elevated the dissolved oxygen from 4 to 13.6\\u202fmg/L and the stability of nanoparticles was significantly improved around 70\\u202fd. Moreover, by increasing the temperature from 4 to 30\\u202f°C, the stability of CaO<sub>2</sub> declined from 120 to 30\\u202fd. The continuous-flow experiments revealed that the naphthalene-contaminated groundwater was completely bio-remediated in the presence of CaO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and microorganisms from the effluent of the column within 50\\u202fd. While, the natural remediation of the contaminant resulted in 19.7% removal at the end of the experiments (350\\u202fd). Additionally, the attached biofilm on the surface of the PRB zone was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which showed the higher biofilm formation on the pumice surfaces in the bioremediation column in comparison to the natural remediation column. The physic-chemical characteristics of the effluents from each column was also analyzed and indicated no negative impact of the bioremediation process on the groundwater. Consequently, the present paper provides a comprehensive study on the application of the CaO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles in PAH-contaminated groundwater treatment.', 30149343: \"In this study, the effect of rhamnolipid and Mg (II) on microbial growth and 1,3-dichlorobenzene removal was investigated in two identical lab-scale biotrickling filters (named BTF1 and BTF2). The contact angle and Henry's constant were detected at various concentrations of rhamnolipid and the results indicated that rhamnolipid is able to effectively improve the solubility of 1,3-dichlorobenzene in medium. The results of the experiments in BTFs showed that the optimal concentrations of rhamnolipid and Mg (II) were 170\\u2009mg/L and 2\\u2009mg/L, respectively. The removal efficiency (RE) of 1,3-dichlorobenzene decreased from 100% to 57.13% for BTF1 that was not fed with rhamnolipid and Mg (II) and from 100% to 86.26% for BTF2 that was fed with rhamnolipid and Mg (II) when the inlet loading rate increased from 2.87 to 83.83\\u2009g/(m<sup>3</sup>\\u2009h) at an empty bed residence time (EBRT) of 60\\u2009s. The dissolved oxygen (DO) was analyzed throughout the entire period and the results showed that the two additives can significantly promote oxygen transfer. In addition, the microbial adhesive strength and community were observed and compared to show the positive role of rhamnolipid and Mg (II).\", 30276698: \"The major challenges for the plants growing in metal-contaminated soils are deficiency of nutrients, biomass reduction, and severe oxidative damages in the presence of heavy metals. In this regard, our aim was to overcome these challenges through the use of efficient microbial strains in metal-polluted soils and to assess its/their physiological and biochemical effects. In the current study, a copper (Cu)-resistant bacterium was isolated from the rhizospheric soil of 'Ziziphus nummularia' and evaluated for its ability to promote the wheat growth under the gradient stress of copper. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the isolate was identified as Pantoea sp. Among the plant growth promoting tests, the isolate showed the production of indole acetic acid, solubilization of inorganic phosphate, and ACC deaminase activity. Also, the isolate showed resistance to many heavy metals and antibiotics and increased the water-soluble copper in solution. The results of pot studies showed that bacterial application promoted various growth parameters of wheat plants and also enhanced the Cu uptake of wheat from the Cu-amended soil. The results showed that enhancement of Cu stress (100 to 300\\xa0mg\\xa0kg<sup>-1</sup>) resulted in a decrease in various compatible solutes such as proline, total soluble sugars, and total protein content, and increase in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), latter of which is the indicator of oxidative stress. Bacterial treatment markedly increased the proline, soluble sugar, total protein content, and decreased the MDA content under Cu stress. In addition, bacterial inoculation significantly alleviated the harmful effect of metal toxicity by decreasing the activation of ROS molecules including superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). The activation of various antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) was noted following bacterial inoculation under Cu stress. Therefore, the present study demonstrates the potential of the isolate Pantoea sp. ZNP-5 to improve the growth and phytoextraction of metal from the metal-polluted soil through the polyphasic mechanism of action.\", 30303545: \"The aim of this study was to assess the biodiversity of endophytic fungi from Arabidopsis arenosa growing on a post mining waste dump and to evaluate their role in plant adaptation to metal toxicity. Severeal of the fungi were beneficial for the plant. Among them, a fungus belonging to the Mucor genus, was found to interact with a broad range of plants, including Brassicaceae metallophytes. Mucor sp. was shown to be highly tolerant to elevated levels of Zn, Cd, and Pb and to accelerate plant-host growth under either toxic-metal stress or control conditions. When inoculated with Mucor sp., A. arenosa under toxic-metal stress acquired more N and showed significantly down-regulated catalase activity, which suggests suppression of toxic-metal-induced oxidative stress. We used the model plant-A. thaliana to evaluate the dynamics of plant-tissue colonization by the fungus as monitored with qPCR and to analyze the host's transcriptome response during early stages of the interaction. The results revealed the induction of a plant-defense and stress-related response on the 5<sup>th</sup> day of co-culture, which was in accord with the decrease of fungal abundance in shoots on the 6<sup>th</sup> day of interaction. Presented results demonstrate the importance of endophytic fungi in plant toxic-metal tolerance.\", 30317095: 'Eliminating the adverse environmental impact of chemical dispersants for oil spill has been a significant challenge since decades ago. Here, we prepared an effective and environmentally-friend dispersant with stable emulsifying capacity by the soybean lecithin and Tween 80. The mean droplet diameters of emulsions prepared by decane decreased from 11.3 to 4.1\\u202fμm, the emulsification index of emulsion climbed from 0 to 22.0% by 0.5\\u202fwt% dispersant. This dispersant exhibits favorable emulsifying capacity when the temperature ranges from 10 to 40\\u202f°C, pH within 5-7, and the concentration of inorganic cation is 30000\\u202fmg/L. Fluorescence microscopy analysis, FTIR, and the interfacial tension meter were employed to investigate the interaction between the soybean lecithin and Tween 80, a clear redshift of the hydroxyl group on the lecithin/Tween 80 dispersant and the detected surfactants over the oil-water interface confirm that there exists a synergy between the lecithin and Tween 80 due to the electrostatic attractions, which tremendously contribute to the reduction in the interfacial tension between water and oil. To further understand the influence of the dispersant on the oil hydrocarbon concentration in the water column, visualization simulation with the varying depths were performed. The results showed that the oil hydrocarbon concentration in the water column bottom was proportional to the addition of the dispersant, which facilitates spilled oil dispersing into smaller droplets, accelerates the biodegradation process. Hence, the lecithin/Tween 80 dispersant can be perceived as a promising alternative for oil spill remediation.', 30340176: 'Nickel (Ni) is becoming a toxic pollutant in agricultural environments. Due to its diverse uses from a range of common household items to industrial applications, it is essential to examine Ni bioavailability in soil and plants. Ni occurs in the environment (soil, water and air) in very small concentrations and eventually taken up by plants through roots once it becomes available in soil. It is an essential nutrient for normal plant growth and development and required for the activation of several enzymes such as urease, and glyoxalase-I. Ni plays important roles in a wide range of physiological processes including seed germination, vegetative and reproductive growth, photosynthesis as well as in nitrogen metabolism. Therefore, plants cannot endure their life cycle without adequate Ni supply. However, excessive Ni concentration can lead to induce ROS production affecting numerous physiological and biochemical processes such as photosynthesis, transpiration, as well as mineral nutrition and causes phytotoxicity in plants. ROS production intensifies the disintegration of plasma membranes and deactivates functioning of vital enzymes through lipid peroxidation. This review article explores the essential roles of Ni in the life cycle of plant as well as its toxic effects in details. In conclusion, we have proposed different viable approaches for remediation of Ni-contaminated soils.', 30362074: 'For decades, human activities, industrialization, and agriculture have contaminated soils and water with several compounds, including potentially toxic metals and organic persistent xenobiotics. The co-occurrence of those toxicants poses challenging environmental problems, as complicated chemical interactions and synergies can arise and lead to severe and toxic effects on organisms. The use of fungi, alone or with bacteria, for bioremediation purposes is a growing biotechnology with high potential in terms of cost-effectiveness, an environmental-friendly perspective and feasibility, and often representing a sustainable nature-based solution. This paper reviews different ecological, metabolic, and physiological aspects involved in fungal bioremediation of co-contaminated soils and water systems, not only addressing best methods and approaches to assess the simultaneous presence of metals and organic toxic compounds and their consequences on provided ecosystem services but also the interactions between fungi and bacteria, in order to suggest further study directions in this field.', 30365537: \"This study aimed to evaluate 1) the influence of gibberellic acid (GA3) in the development of Tifton 85 bermudagrass grown in constructed wetland systems (CWs) and 2) the plant's capacity to remove nutrients and sodium from synthetic municipal wastewater (SMW). The experiment was carried out in Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and consisted of foliar applications of GA3 set in randomized blocks design, with four replicates and 6 treatments as following: NC (control with plants); 0 μM GA3; N1: 5 μM GA3; N2: 25 μM GA3; N3: 50 and N4: 100 μM GA3 per CWs, NC* (control with no plants): 0 μM GA3. The study was conducted over two crop cycles in the spring 2016. The parameters used to evaluate the performance of the Tifton 85 bermudagrass were its plant height, productivity, chlorophyll measurement, number of internodes, nutrients and Na removals. Chemical analyses of the effluents were conducted. In response to the application of GA3, the increase in height of Tifton 85 bermudagrass in the first crop cycle was higher than the increase in height in the second crop cycle. The decrease in plant growth in response to GA3 in the second crop cycle may be linked to the age of the plant tissue and climatic conditions. The greater growth of the plants cultivated in the CWs allows a more efficient removal of pollutants, using simple management and low cost. The results suggest that applying 50 μM of GA3 to the development of Tifton 85 bermudagrass provides higher dry matter yield and removal of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sodium for the first crop cycle in CWs. However, in the second crop cycle, the application of GA3 had no effect on dry matter production and nutrient removal by Tifton 85 bermudagrass in CWs.\", 30384234: 'The responses of methanogenic propionate and butyrate degradation to nano-sized MnO<sub>2</sub> exposure were explored. The results showed that supplementation with 50\\u2009mg/g volatile suspended solids (VSS) of nano-sized MnO<sub>2</sub> significantly enhanced the production rate of CH<sub>4</sub> in propionate and butyrate degradation by 25.6% and 21.7%, respectively. The stimulatory effects most likely resulted from enhancements in the microbial metabolic activity based on the observed increases in the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) secretion and activity of the electron transport system. In contrast, the CH<sub>4</sub> yields obtained were irreversibly inhibited by the presence of 400\\u2009mg/g VSS of nano-sized MnO<sub>2</sub>, in which just 62.8% and 6.5%, respectively, of the yield obtained from the control. Further investigations indicated that supplementation by nano-sized MnO<sub>2</sub> could cause oxidative stress in microbial cells, resulting in the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Compared with that of the control, the amount of intracellular ROS generated in the systems increased by 28.3% (fed with propionate) and 42.5% (fed with butyrate), corresponding to approximately 43.9% and 64.8% losses in cell viability, respectively; thus, ROS generation was suggested to be the main factor responsible for the inhibitory effects of nano-sized MnO<sub>2</sub> on methanogenic propionate and butyrate degradation.', 30385066: 'Metformin (MET), CAS 1115-70-4 (Metformin hydrochloride), is an antidiabetic drug with high usage in North America and Europe and has become the subject of regulatory interest. A pharmaceutical industry working group investigated environmental risks of MET. Environmental fate and chronic effects data were collated across the industry for the present risk assessment. Predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) for MET were modeled for the USA and Europe using the PhATE and GREAT-ER models, respectively. PECs were compared with measured environmental concentrations (MECs) for the USA and Europe. A predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) of 1\\u202fmg/L for MET was derived by deterministic procedures, applying an assessment factor of 10 to the lowest no observed effect concentration (i.e., 10\\u202fmg/L) from multiple chronic studies with algae, daphnids and fish. The PEC/PNEC and MEC/PNEC risk characterization ratios were <1, indicating no significant risk for MET with high Margins of Safety (MOS) of >868. MET is known to degrade during wastewater treatment to guanylurea (GUU, CAS 141-83-3), which we have shown to further degrade. There are no GUU toxicity data in the literature; hence, chronic studies for GUU were conducted to derive a PNEC of 0.16\\u202fmg/L. PECs were derived for GUU as for MET, plus MECs were retrieved from the literature. The PEC/PNEC and MEC/PNEC risk characterization ratios for GUU were also <1, with an MOS of >6.5. Based on standard risk assessment procedures for both MET and its transformation product GUU, there is no significant risk to aquatic life.', 30449313: 'Metformin (MET) is a pharmaceutical with very high use worldwide that is excreted in unchanged form, leading to concern about potential aquatic life impacts associated with MET, and its primary transformation product guanylurea (GUU). This study presents, in two companion papers, a risk assessment following internationally accepted guidelines of MET and GUU in surface water based on literature data, previously unpublished studies, and a new degradation test that resolves conflicting earlier results. Previous studies have shown that MET is removed during sewage treatment, primarily through transformation to GUU. In addition, measurements in WWTPs suggest that MET is not only transformed to GUU, but that GUU is further biodegraded. A prolonged inherent biodegradation test strongly suggests not only primary transformation of MET to GUU, but also subsequent full mineralization of GUU, with both degradation phases starting after a clear lag phase. MET may partition from surface water to sediment, where both transformation to GUU and in part mineralization is possible, depending on the presence of competent degrading microorganisms. In addition, MET may form non-extractable residues in sediments (12.8-73.5%). Both MET and GUU may be anaerobically degraded during sludge digestion, in soils or in sediments. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) values in crops and most plants are close to 1 suggesting low bioaccumulation potential, moreover, at least some plants can metabolize MET to GUU; however, in aquatic plants higher BCFs were found, up to 53. Similarly, neither MET nor GUU are expected to bioaccumulate in fish based on estimated values of BCFs ≤3.16.', 30476844: 'One of the challenges in the petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated groundwater remediation by oxygen releasing compounds (ORCs) is to identify the remediation mechanism and determine the impact of ORCs on the environment and the intrinsic groundwater microorganisms.

For the biodiversity studies, next generation sequencing (NGS) of the 16S rRNA gene was applied. The results showed that naphthalene was metabolized (within 20\\u202fdays) faster than toluene (after 30\\u202fdays) by microorganisms of the aqueous phase. By comparing the contaminant removal in the biotic (which resulted in the complete contaminant removal) and abiotic (around 32% removal for naphthalene and 36% for toluene after 50\\u202fd) conditions, the significant role of microorganisms on the decontamination process was proved. Furthermore, the attached microbial communities on the porous media were visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Microbial community structure analysis by NGS technique revealed that the microbial species which were able to degrade toluene and naphthalene such as P. putida and P. mendocina respectively were stimulated by addition of MgO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles.

The transfer of organic contaminants and heavy metals to the food chain is a major threat to human health. Purging these contaminants often involves a lot of energy and complex engineering processes. Phytoremediation technology can be used in various environments, such as water, soil, and air, to reduce or eliminate different contaminants. The major mechanisms involved in phytoremediation include plant extraction, rhizofiltration, plant evaporation, plant stabilization, plant decomposition, and rhizosphere degradation. The efficiency of phytoremediation can be increased through using chelating and acidifying agents, applying electric current in the soil, using organic chemicals and fertilizers, planting transgenic plants, using bacteria, and applying plant growth regulators. Recently, the use of plant growth regulators has been investigated as a suitable method for improving the efficacy of phytoremediation. Effective plant growth regulators to improve phytoremediation include auxins, gibberellins, cytokinins, and salicylic acid. The activity of these materials depends on their concentration, environmental factors that affect their absorption, and the physiological state of the plant. Using these materials increases the biomass of the plant and reduces the negative effects of the presence of contaminants in the plant. The present study aimed to review the latest studies performed on the improvement of phytoremediation using plant growth regulators and their mechanisms.', 30654517: 'The evolution of regulations concerning biocidal products aims to increase protection of the environment (e.g., EU Regulation No 528/2012) and requires the development of new non-toxic anti-fouling (AF) systems. The development of these formulations implies the use of ingredients (polymers, active substances, additives) that are devoid of toxicity towards marine environments. In this context, the use of erodable antifouling paints based on biodegradable polymer and authorized biocides responds to this problem. However, the efficiency of paints could be improved by the use of specific additives. For this purpose, three additives acting as surface modifiers were studied (Tween 80, Span 85 and PEG-silane). Their effects on parameters involved in antifouling efficiency as hydrophobicity, hydration and copper release were studied. Results showed that the addition of 3% of additives modulated hydrophobicity and hydration without an increase of copper release and significantly reduced microfouling development. Efficient paints based on biodegradable polymer and with no organic biocide could be obtained by mixing copper thiocyanate and additives.', 30660969: 'This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of lime and bisphosphonates (BPs) such as N10O chelate amendment on the growth, physiological and biochemical parameters, and phytoextraction potential of the willow variety Klara (Salix viminalis × S. schwerinii × S. dasyclados) grown in soils heavily contaminated with copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn). The plants were irrigated with tap or processed water (mine wastewater). The results suggest that the combined effects of the contaminated soil and processed water inhibited growth parameters, gas exchange parameters and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) values. In contrast, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, organic acids, total phenolic and total flavonoid contents, and the accumulation of metals/metalloids in the plant tissues were increased compared to the control. When the soil was supplemented with lime and N10O; growth, physiological, biochemical parameters, and resistance capacity were significantly higher compared to unamended soil treatments, especially in the contaminated soil treatments. The combined lime‒ and N10O‒amended soil treatment produced higher growth rates, resistance capacity, photosynthesis rates and phytoextraction efficiency levels relative to either the lime‒amended or the N10O‒amended soil treatments.

Similarly, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that exposure to SMX had an insignificant impact on morphology of the plant organelles. The mechanisms of removal by I.\\xa0aquatica were explored by evaluating contributions of bioadsorption, bioaccumulation and biodegradation. There was negligible adsorption of SMX to plant roots. Accumulation of SMX within plant roots and stems was not observed; however, I.\\xa0aquatica accumulated 17% of SMX in leaves. Thus, the major mechanism of elimination of SMX was biodegradation, which accounted for 82% removal of SMX. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) confirmed that I.\\xa0aquatica biodegraded SMX into simpler compounds, and generated 4-aminophenol as its final product.

One possible explanation is that release of reactive oxygen species by the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles in the light may have increased the rate of leaf decomposition. Bacterial and fungal diversity was highest in the dark, but nanoparticles did not reduce overall diversity.', 30974362: 'Microbial induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a natural bio-mediated process, which has been explored for soil stabilization and heavy metals immobilization in soil and groundwater. Previous studies have shown that MICP is capable of immobilizing various heavy metals including lead (Pb). However, most studies focus merely on the immobilization of heavy metals with relatively low concentration. This study: (1) presents results of an investigation into the toxic effects of Pb on bacterial activity and immobilization efficiency within a wide range of Pb concentrations; and (2) identifies controlling biotic and abiotic factors of Pb immobilization by MICP. In the first series of tests, bacterial strains (Sporosarcina pasteurii) are inoculated into nutrient solutions containing 0-50\\u202fmM Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and incubated at 30\\u202f°C. Biochemical parameters are measured over time, which include pH, electrical conductivity, urease activity, and viable cell number. In the second series of tests, grown bacterial strains are mixed with urea, calcium salts and Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in solution. Viable cell number, produced ammonium concentration, aqueous Pb concentration of the mixed solution, and total precipitation mass are measured. The results show that the presence of Pb has marginal effect on bacterial growth and associated urease activity at Pb concentration\\u202f<\\u202f30\\u202fmM. The calcium source and initial bacteria concentration are found to remarkably influence Pb immobilization efficiency in terms of Pb removal percentage. Supplementary geochemical simulation results indicate that the Pb immobilization mechanisms includes abiotic precipitation, biotic precipitation and bio-sorption.', 31025981: 'Occurrence of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in wastewater treatment systems could impact the ammonia oxidation (AO). This study investigated the reduction of AgNPs and dissociated silver ion (Ag<sup>+</sup>) toxicity on nitrifying sludge using cell entrapment technique. Three entrapment materials, including barium alginate (BA), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and a mixture of polyvinyl alcohol and barium alginate (PVA-BA), were applied. The BA beads provided the highest reduction of silver toxicity (up to 90%) and durability. Live/dead assays showed fatality of entrapped cells after exposure to AgNPs and Ag<sup>+</sup>. The maximum AO rate of the BA-entrapped cells was 5.6 mg-N/g-MLSS/h. The AO kinetics under the presence of silver followed an uncompetitive inhibition kinetic model. The experiments with AgNPs and Ag<sup>+</sup> gave the apparent maximum AO rates of 4.2 and 4.8 mg-N/g-MLSS/h, respectively. The apparent half-saturation constants of the BA-entrapped cells under the presence of silver were 10.5 to 13.4 mg/L. Scanning electron microscopic observation coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated no silver inside the beads. This elucidates that the silver toxicity can be reduced by preventing silver penetration through the porous material, leading to less microbial cell damage. This study revealed the potential of the entrapment technology for mitigating the effect of silver species on nitrification.', 31146232: 'Organic pollutants are widely detected in surface water, groundwater and irrigation sewage in farmland soil, some of which can form complexes with heavy metal ions as ligands in the environment. Acesulfame (ACE), one of the most popular artificial sweeteners, has been found in wastewater sometimes at tens of microgram per liter. However, the combined effects of heavy metals and ACE are still unclear. In the present study, the effects of ACE on cadmium (Cd) absorption and translocation in rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) under different exposure conditions were investigated using hydroponic experiments. Under the combined exposure treatments of ACE and Cd, absorption of Cd and ACE in rice significantly decreased when compared with the single exposure treatments, while the alleviation of oxidative damage in rice was also found. Under the sequential exposure treatments of Cd and ACE, the post-exposed ACE activated the pre-absorbed Cd in plant, and accelerated the release of Cd to the environment as well as its translocation from the roots to shoots. In addition, compared with the single Cd exposure, the accumulated ACE can alleviate the oxidative damage in rice shoots induced by Cd, although the Cd concentrations in shoots changed little. In summary, the combined pollution of artificial sweetener ACE was beneficial to relieve the toxicological damage and ecological risk caused by Cd.', 3389811: 'This study evaluated the microbial degradation of naphthol, naphthalene, and acenaphthene, under aerobic, anaerobic, and denitrification conditions in soil-water systems. Chemical degradation of naphthol and naphthalene in the presence of a manganese oxide was also studied. Naphthol, naphthalene, and acenaphthene were degraded microbially under aerobic conditions from initial aqueous-phase concentrations of 9, 7, and 1 mg/liter to nondetectable levels in 3, 10, and 10 days, respectively. Under anaerobic conditions naphthol degraded to nondetectable levels in 15 days, whereas naphthalene and acenaphthene showed no significant degradation over periods of 50 and 70 days, respectively. Under denitrification conditions naphthol, naphthalene, and acenaphthene were degraded from initial aqueous-phase concentrations of 8, 7, and 0.4 mg/liter to nondetectable levels in 16, 45, and 40 days, respectively. Acclimation periods of approximately 2 days under aerobic conditions and 2 weeks under denitrification conditions were observed for both naphthalene and acenaphthene. Abiotic degradation of naphthalen and naphthol were evaluated by reaction with manganese oxide, a minor soil constituent. In the presence of a manganese oxide, naphthalene showed no abiotic degradation over a period of 9 weeks, whereas the aqueous naphthol concentration decreased from 9 mg/liter to nondetectable levels in 9 days. The results of this study show that low-molecular-weight, unsubstituted, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are amenable to microbial degradation in soil-water systems under denitrification conditions.', 3389819: 'The effects of six phenolic compounds (o-, m-, and p-cresol and 2-, 3-, and 4-ethylphenol) on the anaerobic biodegradation of phenol was examined in batch methanogenic cultures. Results showed that ethylphenols were more inhibitory of phenol degradation than were cresols. The inhibitory effects of the three isomers of cresol and ethylphenol did not vary with the isomer but rather with the substituted functional group.', 3415231: 'Rates of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degradation and mineralization were influenced by preexposure to alternate PAHs and a monoaromatic hydrocarbon at relatively high (100 ppm) concentrations in organic-rich aerobic marine sediments. Prior exposure to three PAHs and benzene resulted in enhanced [14C]naphthalene mineralization, while [14C]anthracene mineralization was stimulated only by benzene and anthracene preexposure. Preexposure of sediment slurries to phenanthrene stimulated the initial degradation of anthracene. Prior exposure to naphthalene stimulated the initial degradation of phenanthrene but had no effect on either the initial degradation or mineralization of anthracene. For those compounds which stimulated [14C]anthracene or [14C]naphthalene mineralization, longer preexposures (2 weeks) to alternative aromatic hydrocarbons resulted in an even greater stimulation response. Enrichment with individual PAHs followed by subsequent incubation with one or two PAHs showed no alteration in degradation patterns due to the simultaneous presence of PAHs. The evidence suggests that exposure of marine sediments to a particular PAH or benzene results in the enhanced ability of these sediments to subsequently degrade that PAH as well as certain other PAHs. The enhanced degradation of a particular PAH after sediments have been exposed to it may result from the selection and proliferation of specific microbial populations capable of degrading it. The enhanced degradation of other PAHs after exposure to a single PAH suggests that the populations selected have either broad specificity for PAHs, common pathways of PAH degradation, or both.', 3580472: \"The known biodegradability of PHB in certain biological environments has led to its proposed use as a 'biodegradable' implant material. Monofilaments of PHB homopolymer and two PHV-PHB copolymers have been studied in vivo and in vitro and assessed for changes in mechanical properties and topography. In vivo biodegradation was only observed with PHB when pre-degraded by 10.0 Mrad of gamma-irradiation before implantation. High temperature in vitro hydrolysis suggested that PHV copolymer additions retarded the rate of degradation of PHB. Hydration reactions had most effect on the ultimate tensile properties of the materials. In contrast, the elastic properties appeared to be relatively unaffected.\", 3925658: 'The rate of biodegradation of the alkyl chain of alkylbenzene sulphonates (ABS) carried out of the alkyl chain by pure adapted cultures of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Aspergillus sp. has been examined in the presence of four anorganic test compounds of commercial detergents. The strains were isolated from sewages by elected cultures. It has been established that the sodium perborate gave a completely different effect on the microbial metabolism of ABS than that obtained with polyphosphate, sulphate and silicate. The perborate possesses an inhibitory effect on the growth and the surfactant-degradative ability of the strains. The authors concluded from it that the presence of 20% perborate in the formula of commercial detergents must be kept in mind where environmental problems are concerned.', 4026288: 'Outdoor artificial streams were treated continuously with pentachlorophenol (PCP) for 88 days during the summer of 1983. The contributions of different stream compartments (microbial habitats) to microbial degradation of PCP were determined in a stream treated with 144 micrograms of PCP per liter. The 488-m long stream was composed of mud-bottomed pools alternating with gravel riffles. PCP loss in the stream attributable to microbial degradation after an adaptation period was in the range of 55 to 74%. Contributions to PCP loss were determined for rock surface (epilithic), macrophyte surface (epiphytic), sedimentary, and water column communities by measuring rates of PCP disappearance in stream water, containing ambient concentrations of PCP, in contact with representative compartmental samples. The specific capability, in units of micrograms of PCP per hour per square meter of stream cross-sectional area (macrophytes at maximum plant density, water column at mean depth, upper 10-cm layer of gravel), followed the order rock surface much greater than macrophytes greater than sediment approximately equal to water column. The compartmental contribution to total stream losses in units of grams per hour followed the same order, although the differences were smaller. The rate of PCP disappearance in the water column above sediment cores followed the order oxygen-rich greater than oxygen-poor approximately equal to anaerobic greater than sorption-only conditions. The large difference in specific capability between the rock surface and sediment compartments could be attributed to oxygen deficiency (because of chemical and biological oxygen demand) in the sediments. Free-floating and particle-attached organisms in the water column were important to PCP biodegradation.', 444706: 'Disappearance rate of BPMC in paddy soils increased with the increase of BPMC concentration in soils, and in contrast, it declined wiht higher moisture content. Since the disapperance rate of BPMC in soils was retarded by addition of sodium azide, it was suggested that soil microorganism(s) participated in the degradation of BPMC. On the other hand, it was probable that organic matter content was one of the main factors participating in the disappearance of BPMC. The soil-bound residues of BPMC which were extractable by heating with 0.5 N HC1 for 15 min, were relatively low, and their percentages ranged from 2.4 to 6.6%. The bound-residues were increased by addition of calcium or magnesium sulfate.', 563207: 'Blastospores of B. bassiana enclosed in fine mesh bags were submitted to soil microflora. Clay minerals coating fungal spores protected from by decreasing bacterial activity. The role of amoeba in biodegradation of fungi is also considered.', 6287562: 'Rheumatic joint destruction usually starts with the destabilisation of cartilage. Lysosomal elastase is a candidate effector of this process, since this enzyme is found at the site of cartilage erosion by rheumatoid synovial tissue. In order to prove this hypothesis we assessed the mechanical stability of cartilage during treatment by this enzyme in vitro. An indentation apparatus was used for this purpose and biochemical as well as microscopic techniques were used to supplement the results thus obtained. Our findings show that elastase irreversibly impairs the stability of cartilage by lysis of matrix proteoglycans without the help of additive enzymes. Collagen fragmentation played no significant role during elastase-induced destabilisation, while specific collagenase attacked the collagen network within the matrix only subsequent to the removal of proteoglycans. These findings suggest that elastase is a leading enzyme during proteolytic cartilage degradation. In addition polysulfonated glycosaminoglycan was found to reduce the mechanical effect of elastase on normal cartilage. It is therefore concluded that local inhibition of elastase promises therapeutic benefit during rheumatic cartilage degradation. Upon treatment of cartilage with elastase we observed this enzyme not only within the matrix under destruction but also bound to chondrocytes. These findings support the hypothesis that elastase plays a role on the matrix not only by direct degradation, but also by an indirect effect mediated through living chondrocytes.', 6317694: \"The purpose of the study was to examine the effect of gamma irradiation on the enzymatic as well as the in vivo degradation of polyglycolic acid sutures. The sutures of size 2-0 were irradiated at dosage levels of 0-20 mrad. The three enzymes chosen for this study were esterase, alpha-chymotrypsin, and trypsin. The irradiated sutures were both immersed in the enzyme solutions; their corresponding buffer controls, and implanted in inbred black-and-white hooded hister rats (Liverpool strain). The degradation of PGA sutures was determined mechanically. Among the three enzymes studied, esterase showed the highest enzymatic effect on the degradation of the unirradiated and irradiated PGA sutures. Trypsin's effect on PGA sutures was not observed until 20 mrad. The findings of trypsin demonstrated the hypothesis that synthetic high molecular weight polymers, which are initially resistant to enzymatic degradation, could become prone to enzymatic attack after altering their physical and chemical structures. Implanted PGA sutures maintained a similar or slightly higher mean tensile breaking strength in in vivo degradation compared to in vitro degradation (0.1M tris buffer of pH = 7.5); these degradation profiles suggest that PGA does not display similar behavior in in vivo and in vitro degradations. The magnitude of dissimilarity depends on the radiation dosage and on the duration of degradation, and is speculated to be attributable to the specific action of enzymes with respect to the configuration and chemical structure of the PGA sutures.\", 6473835: 'A landfill leachate, which contains large amounts of microbially refractory humic substances, was irradiated with 60Co gamma-rays under several conditions and the modification of its biodegradability was examined. The effects of initial pH and dose rate on the modification were found to be insignificant. The apparent effect was observed for the initial concentration of the humic substances. High biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) value was obtained as the initial concentration was higher. As the initial concentration was lower, in contrast, the decreasing rates of total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were high. Therefore two possible designs of the combined radiation-microbial processes with and without dilution are proposed. Both processes require only about 30% of the irradiation dose, compared with a simple radiation process.', 6613168: 'Two newly isolated aniline-degrading bacterial strains were characterized with regard to their enzyme systems responsible for aniline catabolism. One of them identified as a Rhodococcus sp. metabolized aniline exclusively via the beta-ketoadipate pathway by means of inducible enzymes. The aniline-degrading enzyme system of the second isolate, presumably a pseudomonad, was shown to consist of an inducible aniline-converting enzyme and constitutive meta-pathway enzymes. Both isolates failed to metabolize monochlorinated anilines in the absence of additional carbon sources. To explain this the ring-cleaving enzymes of both isolates were examined for their substrate specificities. Furthermore, the effect of 4-chlorocatechol on the enzymes catalyzing aniline conversion and catechol oxygenation was investigated.', 6874533: 'A study of the stability of polypropylene fiber, size 4-0, to ultraviolet light was performed. Samples were radiated in physiological saline solution at 35.5 +/- 1.5 degrees C using a xenon-arc lamp at an intensity of 650 milliwatts per square centimeter. The light was filtered to remove wavelengths below 300 nanometers and thus simulated transmittance of the cornea. Tensile strength, elongation and modulus, and the surface morphology of the fiber by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were determined as a function of exposure time. The average ultraviolet (UV) light intensity which irradiates the eye was determined from available meteorological data and was used to calculate human exposure at various geographical locations. This information along with the light energy of the xenon-arc lamp was used to calculate the useful lifetime of polypropylene fiber in the anterior chamber. Using an average exposure of 2.2 hours per day for a 60-year-old implant recipient, the useful lifetime ranges from 53 years in Miami, Florida, to 75 years in Seattle, Washington. Polypropylene loops from lenses which had been implanted in human eyes for up to 4.8 years showed no molecular degradation as compared to control material. Polypropylene fiber is therefore safe for use in anterior chamber implants.', 7487038: 'Practical utilization of the polysaccharides in the lignocellulosic complex is limited because of the high lignin content of the complex. In this study we focused on the effect of Mn on lignin and cellulose biodegradation during solid-state fermentation by the edible mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus. Preferential degradation of lignin was enhanced by the addition of Mn(II) to cotton stalks at concentrations ranging from 30 to 620 micrograms of Mn per g. This effect was most apparent when we compared mineralization rates of [14C] lignin with mineralization rates of [14C] cellulose. Enhanced selectivity was also observed when we analyzed residual organic matter at the end of the fermentation period by using crude fiber analysis. The cellulose fraction in the original material was 1.8 times larger than the cellulose fraction of lignin. The cellulose/lignin ratio increased during 32 days of solid-state fermentation from 2.5 in the control to 3.3 following the addition of Mn to the medium. The in vitro digestibility value for fermented cotton stalks was 53% of the dry matter. Addition of 600 micrograms of Mn per g to the cotton stalks resulted in a digestibility value of 65.4%. Enhancement of preferential lignin degradation could be result of either increased activity of the ligninolytic enzymes or production of Mn (III), which might preferentially degrade aromatic structures in the lignocellulosic complex.', 7516282: 'The influence of pollutants on the formation of 14CO2 from 3 micrograms/liter labeled chloroform was studied in anaerobic Dutch river sediments. All incubations were performed under anaerobic conditions. Addition of toxicants to sediment microcosms showed logistic dose-effect curves. The concentration giving 10% inhibition of the chloroform mineralization rate (IC10) was derived from these dose-effect curves. The IC10 values of added cadmium, chloropyrifos, benzene, mercury, or 1,2-dichloroethane were 1300, 1300, 140, 90, and 0.07 mg/kg dry sediment, respectively. Mud samples taken at different dates from the same site indicated a significantly different sensitivity to added pentachlorophenol and zinc. The IC10 of added pentachlorophenol was 150 mg/kg in one and 15 mg/kg in another sample. Chloroform-mineralizing bacteria are very sensitive to addition of zinc. The IC10 of added zinc was 700 mg/kg for one sample and 11 mg/kg for another sample of the sediment which contained a background concentration of 800 mg Zn/kg. Therefore, a partial inhibition of the mineralization of chloroform by the high concentrations of zinc present in Dutch river sediments cannot be excluded. The high concentration of zinc might cause persistence of otherwise biodegradable pollutants in Dutch sediments.', 7662299: \"A series of experiments was conducted to examine the effects of chemical pretreatment on biodegradation of 14C-labeled PCB congeners in aqueous systems. Fenton's reagent was used to generate hydroxyl radicals (OH) which were successful in partially oxidizing/transforming otherwise recalcitrant molecules of tetrachlorinated PCB, but had little or no impact on the biodegradation of a monochlorinated congener. Application of Fenton's reagent (1% H2O2, 1 mM FeSO4) followed by inoculation with pure cultures Pseudomonas sp, strain LB 400 and Alcaligenes eutrophus, strain H850 resulted in the removal of approximately 38% of 2-chlorobiphenyl and 51% of 2,2',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl in the form of 14CO2. Comparison of the rate and extent of biodegradation of 2,2',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl after the application of Fenton's reagent with the dynamic and final level of radioactivity in the aqueous phase of experimental system suggests two possible means of microbial utilization of tetrachlorinated PCB congener altered by chemical oxidation: (a) consumption of the partially oxidized chemical dissolved in the aqueous phase, and (b) direct microbial attack on the transformed compound, which may still be adhered to the solid surface.\", 7691530: 'The mineralization of [14C]acetate was studied in bottles with fresh soil and groundwater. Addition of toxicants inhibited the formation of 14CO2 and dose-effect curves were obtained. The acetate mineralization was not inhibited by zinc, cadmium, K2Cr2O7, chloropyrifos, and paraquat in an acid sandy soil at 1000 mg/kg dry soil. The IC10 is the toxicant concentration which inhibits 10% of the initial mineralization rate. The IC10 concentrations for 3,4-dichloroaniline, triphenyltin, and orthoxylene were 48, 96, and 730 mg/kg, respectively, in the acid sandy soil. The IC10 of pentachlorophenol was measured in samples from the acid sandy soil and in several other soil and subsoil samples. The geometrical mean of the 13 IC10 values was 16 mg pentachlorophenol/kg. A statistical method was used to calculate the PCP concentration above which 5% of the most sensitive acetate-mineralizing communities in all soils are influenced. The best estimate of this concentration is 0.3 mg PCP/kg but to be on the safe side the 95% confidence level of this concentration is 25 micrograms/kg.', 7736358: 'Nonproliferating cells of Mycobacterium vaccae that were grown on propane could mineralize limited amounts of trichloroethylene. Intermediates in the biodegradation of trichloroethylene were 2,2,2-trichloroethanol and 2,2,2-trichloroacetaldehyde. Trichloroethanol was completely degraded when added to a nonproliferating cell suspension of Mycobacterium vaccae. Addition of toluene to the reaction mixtures effected a 50% increase in the mineralization of [14C]trichloroethylene.', 7747970: 'Sulfidogenic consortia enriched from an estuarine sediment were maintained on either 2-, 3-, or 4-chlorophenol as the only source of carbon and energy for over 5 years. The enrichment culture on 4-chlorophenol was the most active and this consortium was selected for further characterization. Utilization of chlorophenol resulted in sulfate depletion corresponding to the values expected for complete mineralization to CO2. Degradation of 4-chlorophenol was coupled to sulfate reduction, since substrate utilization was dependent on sulfidogenesis and chlorophenol loss did not proceed in the absence of sulfate. Other sulfur oxyanions, sulfite or thiosulfate, also served as electron acceptors for chlorophenol utilization, while carbonate, nitrate, and fumarate did not. The sulfidogenic consortium utilized phenol, 4-bromophenol, and 4-iodophenol in addition to 4-chlorophenol. 4-Fluorophenol, however, did not serve as a substrate. 4-Bromo- and 4-iodophenol were degraded with stoichiometric release of halide, and 4-[14C]bromophenol was mineralized, with 90% of the radiolabel recovered as CO2.', 7765670: 'The microbial populations in PCB-contaminated electric power substation capacitor bank soil (TVA soil) and from another PCB-contaminated site (New England soil) were compared to determine their potential to degrade PCB. Known biphenyl operon genes were used as gene probes in colony hybridizations and in dot blots of DNA extracted from the soil to monitor the presence of PCB-degrading organisms in the soils. The microbial populations in the two soils differed in that the population in New England soil was enriched by the addition of 1000 p.p.m. 2-chlorobiphenyl (2-CB) whereas the population in the TVA capacitor bank soil was not affected. PCB degradative activity in the New England soil was indicated by a 50% PCB disappearance (gas chromatography), accumulation of chlorobenzoates (HPLC), and 14CO2 evolution from 14C-2CB. The PCB-degrading bacteria in the New England soil could be identified by their positive hybridization to the bph gene probes, their ability to produce the yellow meta-cleavage product from 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (2,3-DHB), and the degradation of specific PCB congeners by individual isolates in resting cell assays. Although the TVA capacitor bank soil lacked effective PCB-degrading populations, addition of a PCB-degrading organism and 10,000 p.p.m. biphenyl resulted in a > 50% reduction of PCB levels. Molecular characterization of soil microbial populations in laboratory scale treatments is expected to be valuable in the design of process monitoring and performance verification approaches for full scale bioremediation.', 8027005: 'Laboratory incubation studies were made on soils collected from five field sites with different histories of treatment with carbofuran. All soils treated earlier with carbofuran degraded the compound more rapidly than untreated samples of the same soils. Reduced rates of degradation in the presence of chloramphenicol imply that soil bacteria are primarily responsible for the breakdown of carbofuran in these soils. Sixty-eight bacteria, capable of degrading carbofuran as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen, were isolated from liquid cultures of treated soils. The concentration of carbofuran in the liquid medium used for isolation and subsequent culture of carbofuran-degrading isolates appeared to affect the stability of their ability to degrade. Similar types of carbofuran-degrading bacteria were isolated from different soils and several different types were isolated from one soil. All carbofuran-degrading isolates were Gram-negative, aerobic rods which hydrolysed the insecticide to carbofuran phenol. They were separated into four groups on the basis of a limited number of phenotypic characters. There was a good correlation between the phenotype of carbofuran-degrading isolates and the stability of their ability to degrade. Fourteen isolates were placed in phenotypic group I and 13 of these did not degrade carbofuran after one subculture in liquid medium. Phenotypic groups II, III and IV consisted of 54 isolates in total (3, 46 and 5 isolates respectively) and 52 of these retained their ability to degrade carbofuran when subcultured.', 8069780: 'The effect of a chromated-copper-arsenate wood preservative on the degradation of pentachlorophenol by Flavobacterium sp. strain ATCC 53874 was examined in liquid culture. Both a commercially available and a laboratory-prepared formulation were tested. Each increased the lag time required for measurable pentachlorophenol degradation and the time required for complete degradation to nondetectable levels. This response was noted at all pentachlorophenol concentrations examined (10, 25, 50, 75, and 100 micrograms.mL-1). The commercial formulation of chromated-copper-arsenate had the more significant impact on pentachlorophenol degradation. Inhibitory effects were evident at chromated-copper-arsenate component metal concentrations 0.1-0.5 mg.L-1. These levels are thousands of times below those used commercially.', 8087475: 'Glyphosate (Roundup), when applied to the soil usually did not exert any significant effect on the total count of soil fungi after all periods of the experiment except after 6 and 10 weeks where the count was inhibited by the two doses used (1.84, 9.2 mg active ingredient/kg dry soil). When the herbicide was incorporated into the agar medium the count of total fungi, Acremonium strictum and Aspergillus fumigatus was significantly increased by the two doses used and of Penicillium glabrum by the high dose only. However, P. funiculosum was completely eliminated by the high dose. Oxygen consumption in soil treated with glyphosate was significantly inhibited by the high dose after 2 weeks and by the two doses after 6, 8 and 10 weeks. Glyphosate exerted two significant effects of stimulation and inhibition on the rate of the decay of stem segments of three plants at certain treatments of dose and time.', 8117078: 'Methanol is an important anaerobic substrate in industrial wastewater treatment and the natural environment. Previous studies indicate that cobalt greatly stimulates methane formation during anaerobic treatment of methanolic wastewaters. To evaluate the effect of cobalt in a mixed culture, a sludge with low background levels of cobalt was cultivated in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor. Specific inhibitors in batch assays were then utilized to study the effect of cobalt on the growth rate and activity of different microorganisms involved in the anaerobic degradation of methanol. Only methylotrophic methanogens and acetogens were stimulated by cobalt additions, while the other trophic groups utilizing downstream intermediates, H2-CO2 or acetate, were largely unaffected. The optimal concentration of cobalt for the growth and activity of methanol-utilizing methanogens and acetogens was 0.05 mg liter-1. The higher requirement of cobalt is presumably due to the previously reported production of unique corrinoid-containing enzymes (or coenzymes) by direct utilizers of methanol. This distinctly high requirement of cobalt by methylotrophs should be considered during methanolic wastewater treatment. Methylotroph methanogens presented a 60-fold-higher affinity for methanol than acetogens. This result in combination with the fact that acetogens grow slightly faster than methanogens under optimal cobalt conditions indicates that acetogens can outcompete methanogens only when reactor methanol and cobalt concentrations are high, provided enough inorganic carbon is available.', 8117081: 'The biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) often is limited by low water solubility and dissolution rate. Nonionic surfactants and sodium dodecyl sulfate increased the concentration of PAH in the water phase because of solubilization. The degradation of PAH was inhibited by sodium dodecyl sulfate because this surfactant was preferred as a growth substrate. Growth of mixed cultures with phenanthrene and fluoranthene solubilized by a nonionic surfactant prior to inoculation was exponential, indicating a high bioavailability of the solubilized hydrocarbons. Nonionic surfactants of the alkylethoxylate type and the alkylphenolethoxylate type with an average ethoxylate chain length of 9 to 12 monomers were toxic to a PAH-degrading Mycobacterium sp. and to several PAH-degrading mixed cultures. Toxicity of the surfactants decreased with increasing hydrophilicity, i.e., with increasing ethoxylate chain length. Nontoxic surfactants enhanced the degradation of fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, and pyrene.', 8162195: 'Alteration of the microbial coenosis and biological activity of different types of soils as well as peculiarities of survival of sanitary-significant and pathogenic microorganisms under the effect of sulphonol and a sulphonol-lead complex have been studied in the laboratory model experiment. The most sensitive tests were as follows: the number of nitrifying bacteria; nitrifying, proteolytic, dehydrogenase and cellulase activity; survival of salmonella and lactose-positive colibacilli. Under the effect of the tested sulphonol (0.5 and 3 mg/l) and lead (0.1 and 2 mg/l) concentrations the self-purification processes in soil were not substantially disturbed, though surfactants negatively affected viability of enterobacteria.', 8250573: 'We have isolated two soil bacteria (identified as Arthrobacter aurescens TW17 and Nocardia sp. strain TW2) capable of degrading p-nitrophenol (PNP) and numerous other phenolic compounds. A. aurescens TW17 contains a large plasmid which correlated with the PNP degradation phenotype. Degradation of PNP by A. aurescens TW17 was induced by preexposure to PNP, 4-nitrocatechol, 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol, or m-nitrophenol, whereas PNP degradation by Nocardia sp. strain TW2 was induced by PNP, 4-nitrocatechol, phenol, p-cresol, or m-nitrophenol. A. aurescens TW17 initially degraded PNP to hydroquinone and nitrite. Nocardia sp. strain TW2 initially converted PNP to hydroquinone or 4-nitrocatechol, depending upon the inducing compound.', 8256422: 'The parasiticide ivermectin has been administered to domestic livestock since 1981 to control internal and external parasites, including insects; some of the ivermectin is excreted unchanged in faeces. Concerns over the effects of ivermectin on dung-utilising insect populations and the potential for consequent persistence of dung on pastures have been raised. This paper presents the results of a study over two grazing seasons of the rate of decomposition of cattle dung pats exposed to normal environmental influences. The cattle had been treated at therapeutic levels with either an injectable or a sustained release bolus formulation of ivermectin. It was concluded that the rate of decomposition of the dung pats, the extent of their avoidance by the cows, the organic matter content of the soil and the populations of earthworms in the pastures were not affected by the use of ivermectin.', 8263003: 'The hydrolytic degradation of poly(DL-lactic acid) in an aqueous environment in which hydroxyl radicals have been generated has been investigated. Different methods (gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy) were employed to study the mechanisms of degradation of this amorphous physiologically absorbable polymer. The data indicated that the hydroxyl radical is likely to be a significant factor in the degradation of this polymer.', 8263005: 'The aim of this study was to alter the hydrolytic degradation property of synthetic absorbable suture fibers so that their mass loss would occur at a shorter time without significantly compromising their tensile strength loss profile. A two-step treatment concept (gamma-irradiation followed by Parylene plasma deposition) was introduced for achieving this aim. Vicryl and Maxon were used as the model compounds to test this new concept. After the treatment, the in vitro hydrolytic degradation properties of Vicryl and Maxon were evaluated by weight loss, tensile breaking strength, heat of fusion and melting temperature, intrinsic viscosity, surface wettability, and surface morphology. The results suggested that gamma-irradiation at a dosage level between 0.2-2.0 Mrad for Vicryl sutures and about 2.0 Mrad for Maxon sutures were the most effective dosages to accelerate the suture mass loss. The subsequent Parylene plasma deposition treatment statistically significantly improved the retention of tensile strength for both gamma-irradiated Vicryl and Maxon sutures and hence counteracted the undesirable gamma-irradiation induced acceleration of tensile strength loss. However, this second-step Parylene plasma treatment extended the suture mass loss to longer periods. These findings were consistent with the observed surface wettability, surface morphology, intrinsic viscosity, and thermal properties. A thin hydrophobic Parylene skin layer wrapped around a suture was responsible for the slower rate in mass and strength loss. This outer skin layer acted as a barrier to not only water but also degradation fragments.', 8290478: 'The proteolytic degradation of porcine zinc insulin by alpha-chymotrypsin was previously found to depend markedly on the state of insulin aggregation (Pharm. Res. 9:864-869, 1992). In this study, the effect of bile salt-unsaturated fatty acid mixed micelles on alpha-chymotryptic degradation of insulin was further characterized. The incorporation of linoleic acid has greatly accelerated insulin degradation with the apparent first order rate constant being linearly related to the concentration of linoleic acid. At a 10 mM linoleic acid concentration solubilized in 10 mM sodium glycocholate, the proteolytic degradation rate constant increased by 16 times, which could not be explained solely by the mechanism of insulin oligomer dissociation. Further, this effect is significantly reduced when the free carboxylic group of linoleic acid is methylated. The catalytic role of mixed micelles on chemical degradation of insulin was found to depend on the concentration of linoleic acid incorporated. When solubilized in the form of mixed micelles, linoleic acid chemically catalyzes peptide bond cleavage in a concentration-dependent manner.', 8346635: 'Eight female calves of the Deutsches Fleckvieh breed, weighing 161-207 kg, were each treated at turnout on 16 May 1989 with one ivermectin sustained-release intraruminal bolus designed to release ivermectin at 12 mg day-1 for approximately 120 days. Eight animals remained as untreated controls. A third group of eight unmedicated tracer calves was not considered as part of this evaluation. All 24 animals grazed together on a single pasture throughout the study. On Days 21/22, 70 and 119, 15 faecal pats were selected from each treatment group and ranked according to surface area; within each group of three consecutively ranked pairs of pats, two pairs were randomly allocated as observation pats and the third as a sampling pat. The surface area of observation pats was measured, photographs taken, and dry matter, crude ash and organic matter determined at various intervals following deposition. A 1/4 sample collected from sampling pats 3, 7, 14 and 28 days after deposition was weighed and examined for Coleoptera (adults and larvae), Diptera larvae and nematodes. No differences between groups were seen in respect of organic matter content, numbers or frequency of adult Coleoptera species and soil nematodes. A decrease in numbers of Coleoptera larvae, Diptera larvae and dung-specific nematodes was observed in pats from ivermectin-treated cattle. Based on the evaluation of the surface area, a delay in the degradation rate of pats from treated compared with those from untreated animals was seen; however, the difference was statistically not significant (P > 0.05).', 8357248: 'Under denitrifying conditions, Pseudomonas sp. strain KC transforms carbon tetrachloride (CT) to carbon dioxide via a complex but as yet undetermined mechanism. Transformation rates were first order with respect to CT concentration over the CT concentration range examined (0 to 100 micrograms/liter) and proportional to protein concentration, giving pseudo-second-order kinetics overall. Addition of ferric iron (1 to 20 microM) to an actively transforming culture inhibited CT transformation, and the degree of inhibition increased with increasing iron concentration. By removing iron from the trace metals solution or by removing iron-containing precipitate from the growth medium, higher second-order rate coefficients were obtained. Copper also plays a role in CT transformation. Copper was toxic at neutral pH. By adjusting the medium pH to 8.2, soluble iron and copper levels decreased as a precipitate formed, and CT transformation rates increased. However, cultures grown at high pH without any added trace copper (1 microM) exhibited slower growth rates and greatly reduced rates of CT transformation, indicating that copper is required for CT transformation. The use of pH adjustment to decrease iron solubility, to avoid copper toxicity, and to provide a selective advantage for strain KC was evaluated by using soil slurries and groundwater containing high levels of iron. In samples adjusted to pH 8.2 and inoculated with strain KC, CT disappeared rapidly in the absence or presence of acetate or nitrate supplements. CT did not disappear in pH-adjusted controls that were not inoculated with strain KC.', 8364800: 'An anaerobic consortium that carboxylated and dehydroxylated phenol to benzoate, and 2-cresol to 3-methylbenzoic acid, under methanogenic conditions was studied. Phenol induced this transformation activity. Addition of 4-hydroxypyridine or an increase in the concentration of proteose peptone to 0.5% (w/v) delayed the transformation. Phenol enhanced the rate of transformation of 2-cresol whereas 2-cresol delayed the transformation of phenol. Phenols with ortho-substitutions (chloro-, fluoro-, bromo-, hydroxyl-, amino-, or carboxyl-) were transformed to meta-substituted benzoic acids. However, meta- and para-substituted phenols (cresols, fluorophenols, and chlorophenols) were not transformed. Phenol was most rapidly metabolized, followed by catechol, 2-cresol, 2-fluorophenol, 2-aminophenol, 2-chlorophenol, 2-hydroxybenzoic acid, and 2-bromophenol. The consortium O-demethylated anisole to phenol and 2-methoxyphenol to catechol, and oxidized 2-hydroxybenzyl alcohol to 2-hydroxybenzoic acid. Aniline, 2-ethylphenol, 2-hydroxypyridine, 2-acetamidophenol, 2,6-dimethylphenol, 2-phenylphenol, and 1-naphthol were not metabolized.', 8368842: 'Degradation of propionate and butyrate in whole and disintegrated granules from a thermophilic (55 degrees C) upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor fed with acetate, propionate, and butyrate as substrates was examined. The propionate and butyrate degradation rates in whole granules were 1.16 and 4.0 mumol/min/g of volatile solids, respectively, and the rates decreased 35 and 25%, respectively, after disintegration of the granules. The effect of adding different hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria (both sulfate reducers and methanogens), some of which used formate in addition to hydrogen, to disintegrated granules was tested. Addition of either Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta H, a hydrogen-utilizing methanogen that does not use formate, or Methanobacterium sp. strain CB12, a hydrogen- and formate-utilizing methanogen, to disintegrated granules increased the degradation rate of both propionate and butyrate. Furthermore, addition of a thermophilic sulfate-reducing bacterium (a Desulfotomaculum sp. isolated in our laboratory) to disintegrated granules improved the degradation of both substrates even more than the addition of methanogens. By monitoring the hydrogen partial pressure in the cultures, a correlation between the hydrogen partial pressure and the degradation rate of propionate and butyrate was observed, showing a decrease in the degradation rate with increased hydrogen partial pressure. No significant differences in the stimulation of the degradation rates were observed when the disintegrated granules were supplied with methanogens that utilized hydrogen only or hydrogen and formate. This indicated that interspecies formate transfer was not important for stimulation of propionate and butyrate degradation.', 8368872: 'Monosubstituted nitro- and aminophenol isomers exhibited limited biodegradability under methanogenic conditions when supplied as the sole source of carbon and energy. This was examined by supplying to the same sediment samples, each isomer of nitro- and aminophenol as a sole source of added carbon under either N-supplemented or N-deprived methanogenic conditions. The results demonstrated that under N-supplemented conditions, only 2-NP (NP = nitrophenol), 4-NP and 4-AP (AP = aminophenol) were stoichiometrically mineralized, 2-AP, 3-AP, and the 3-AP metabolite formed from 3-NP reduction were persistent over the 51-week incubation period. In addition, NP isomers inhibited initial rates of methanogenesis, while all AP amended cultures exhibited no significant inhibition in the rate of methanogenesis. Under N-deprived conditions, 2-NP, 2-AP and 4-AP were mineralized, while 3-NP, 4-NP and 3-AP were persistent over the 51-week incubation period. Although all NP isomers were still metabolized through the corresponding AP isomer, the deprivation of nitrogen significantly depressed both the rate and extent of methanogenesis. In general, nitrogen supplemented cultures produced 25% more methane than the nitrogen limited cultures, and the initial rates of methanogenesis were four times greater. While these data showed that under N-deprived conditions methanogenesis was inhibited to a greater extent by these compounds, it also suggests that N-deprived conditions may have facilitated the establishment of a 2-AP metabolizing consortium.', 8476278: 'The effects of acetate, propionate, and butyrate on the anaerobic thermophilic conversion of propionate by methanogenic sludge and by enriched propionate-oxidizing bacteria in syntrophy with Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta H were studied. The methanogenic sludge was cultivated in an upflow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB) reactor fed with propionate (35 mM) as the sole substrate for a period of 80 days. Propionate degradation was shown to be severely inhibited by the addition of 50 mM acetate to the influent of the UASB reactor. The inhibitory effect remained even when the acetate concentration in the effluent was below the level of detection. Recovery of propionate oxidation occurred only when acetate was omitted from the influent medium. Propionate degradation by the methanogenic sludge in the UASB reactor was not affected by the addition of an equimolar concentration (35 mM) of butyrate to the influent. However, butyrate had a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of the propionate-oxidizing enrichment culture. In that case, the conversion of propionate was almost completely inhibited at a butyrate concentration of 10 mM. However, addition of a butyrate-oxidizing enrichment culture abolished the inhibitory effect, and propionate oxidation was even stimulated. All experiments were conducted at pH 7.0 to 7.7. The thermophilic syntrophic culture showed a sensitivity to acetate and propionate similar to that of mesophilic cultures described in the literature. Additions of butyrate or acetate to the propionate medium had no effect on the hydrogen partial pressure in the biogas of an UASB reactor, nor was the hydrogen partial pressure in propionate-degrading cultures affected by the two acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)', 8476290: 'Nitrate, sulfate, and carbonate were used as electron acceptors to examine the anaerobic biodegradability of chlorinated aromatic compounds in estuarine and freshwater sediments. The respective denitrifying, sulfidogenic, and methanogenic enrichment cultures were established on each of the monochlorinated phenol and monochlorinated benzoic acid isomers, using sediment from the upper (freshwater) and lower (estuarine) Hudson River and the East River (estuarine) as source materials. Utilization of each chlorophenol and chlorobenzoate isomer was observed under at least one reducing condition; however, no single reducing condition permitted the metabolism of all six compounds tested. The anaerobic biodegradation of the chlorophenols and chlorobenzoates depended on the electron acceptor available and on the position of the chlorine substituent. In general, similar activities were observed under the different reducing conditions in both the freshwater and estuarine sediments. Under denitrifying conditions, degradation of 3- and 4-chlorobenzoate was accompanied by nitrate loss corresponding reasonably to the stoichiometric values expected for complete oxidation of the chlorobenzoate to CO2. Under sulfidogenic conditions, 3- and 4-chlorobenzoate, but not 2-chlorobenzoate, and all three monochlorophenol isomers were utilized, while under methanogenic conditions all compounds except 4-chlorobenzoate were metabolized. Given that the pattern of activity appears different for these chlorinated compounds under each reducing condition, their biodegradability appears to be more a function of the presence of competent microbial populations than one of inherent molecular structure.', 8580642: 'Many microorganisms fail to degrade pollutants when introduced in different natural environments. This is a problem in selecting inocula for bioremediation of polluted sites. Thus, a study was conducted to determine the success of four inoculants to degrade p-nitrophenol (PNP) in lake and industrial wastewater and the effects of organic compounds on the degradation of high and low concentrations of PNP in these environments. Corynebacterium strain Z4 when inoculated into the lake and wastewater samples containing 20 micrograms/ml of PNP degraded 90% of PNP in one day. Addition of 100 micrograms/ml of glucose as a second substrate did not enhance the degradation of PNP and the bacterium utilized the two substrates simultaneously. Glucose used at the same concentration (100 micrograms/ml), inhibited degradation of 20 micrograms of PNP in wastewater by Pseudomonas strain MS. However, glucose increased the extent of degradation of PNP by Pseudomonas strain GR. Phenol also enhanced the degradation of PNP in wastewater by Pseudomonas strain GR, but had no effect on the degradation of PNP by Corynebacterium strain Z4. Addition of 100 micrograms/ml of glucose as a second substrate into the lake water samples containing low concentration of PNP (26 ng/ml) enhanced the degradation of PNP and the growth of Corynebacterium strain Z4. In the presence of glucose, it grew from 2 x 10(4) to 4 x 10(4) cells/ml in 3 days and degraded 70% of PNP as compared to samples without glucose in which the bacterium declined in cell number from 2 x 10(4) to 8 x 10(3) cells/ml and degraded only 30% PNP. The results suggest that in inoculation to enhance biodegradation, depending on the inoculant, second organic substrate many play an important role in controlling the rate and extent of biodegradation of organic compounds.', 8580643: 'In polluted soil or ground water, inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen may be limiting, so that Monod kinetics for carbon limitation may not describe microbial growth and contaminant biodegradation rates. To test this hypothesis we measured 14CO2 evolved by a pure culture of Acinetobacter johnsonii degrading 120 micrograms 14C-phenol per ml in saturated sand with molar carbon:nitrogen (CN) ratios ranging from 1.5 to 560. We fit kinetics models to the data using non-linear least squares regression. Phenol disappearance and population growth were also measured at CN1.5 and CN560. After a 5- to 10-hour lag period, most of the 14CO2 evolution curves at all CN ratios displayed a sigmoidal shape, suggesting that the microbial populations grew. As CN ratio increased, the initial rate of 14CO2 evolution decreased. Cell growth and phenol consumption occurred at both CN1.5 and CN560, and showed the same trends as the 14CO2 data. A kinetics model assuming population growth limited by a single substrate best fit the 14CO2 evolution data for CN1.5. At intermediate to high CN ratios, the data were best fit by a model originally formulated to describe no-growth metabolism of one substrate coupled with microbial growth on a second substrate. We suggest that this dual-substrate model describes linear growth on phenol while nitrogen is available and first-order metabolism of phenol without growth after nitrogen is depleted.', 8776849: 'A strain of Pseudomonas marginalis PD-14B, isolated from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contaminated soil, produced an extracellular surface-active factor of high molecular weight containing protein and lipopolysaccharide. A crude preparation of the factor, obtained from the culture both of cells grown in mineral salts (MS) medium with succinate and yeast extract, affected the extent of PAH degradation by the bacterial cells and prevented flocculation of PAHs in an aqueous suspension. A washed suspension of P. marginalis cells also prevented flocculation of PAH suspensions and emulsified liquid hydrocarbons. Incubation of the factor and the factor-producing strain in the presence of different PAHs resulted in gradual increase of turbidity of the PAH dispersions. The factor markedly stimulated rate and extent of turbidity generation by bacterial cells. The surface-active factor may promote infection of lettuce and other plants by this known pathogen and may also have application in bioremediation.', 8782391: 'The inhibitory effect of creosote compounds on the aerobic degradation of benzene was studied in microcosm experiments. A total removal of benzene was observed after twelve days of incubation in microcosms where no inhibition was observed. Thiophene and benzothiophene, two heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing sulfur (S-compounds), had a significant inhibitory effect on the degradation of benzene, but also an inhibitory effect of benzofuran (an O-compound) and 1-methylpyrrole (a N-compound) could be observed, although the effect was weaker. The NSO-compounds also had an inhibitory effect on the degradation of p-xylene, o-xylene, and naphthalene, while they only had a weak influence on the degradation of 1-methylnaphthalene, o-cresol and 2,4-dimethylphenol. The phenolic compounds seemed to have a weak stimulating effect on the degradation of benzene whereas the monoaromatic hydrocarbons and the naphthalenes had no significant influence on the benzene degradation. The inhibitory effect of the NSO-compounds on the aerobic degradation of benzene could be identified as three different phenomena. The lag phase increased, the degradation rate decreased, and a residual concentration of benzene was observed in microcosms when NSO-compounds were present. The results show that NSO-compounds can have a potential inhibitory effect on the degradation of many creosote compounds, and that inhibitory effects in mixtures can be important for the degradation of different compounds.', 8782394: 'Diesel fuel pollution in coastal waters, resulting from recreational boating and commercial shipping operations, is common and can adversely affect marine biota. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of additions of particulate organic carbon (POC) in the form of naturally-occurring marsh grass (Spartina alterniflora), inorganic nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), inert particles, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) on diesel fuel biodegradation and to attempt to formulate an effective bioremedial treatment for small diesel fuel spills in marine waters. Various combinations of treatments were added to water samples from a coastal marina to stimulate diesel fuel biodegradation. Diesel fuel was added in concentrations approximating those found in a spill and biodegradation of straight chain aliphatic constituents was estimated by measuring mineralization of 14C hexadecane added to diesel fuel. All treatments that included POC showed stimulation of biodegradation. However, the addition of inert particles (glass fiber filters and nylon screening) caused no stimulation of biodegradation. The addition of nitrogen and phosphorus alone did not result in stimulation of biodegradation, but nitrogen and Spartina (although not phosphorus and Spartina) did result in stimulation above that of Spartina alone. Maximum biodegradation rates were obtained by the addition of the Spartina POC, ammonium, and phosphate. The addition of mannitol, a labile DOC source with POC and phosphate resulted in a decrease in diesel fuel biodegradation as compared to POC and phosphate alone. The seasonal pattern of diesel fuel biodegradation showed a maximum in the summer and a minimum in the winter. Therefore, of the treatments tested, the most effective for bioremediation of diesel fuel in marine waters is the addition of POC, nitrogen, and phosphorus.', 8813078: 'Biodegradation of ceramics in vivo is achieved essentially by monocytes and multinuclear cells (osteoclasts). Monocytes are the key element in this process because they intervene first at the biomaterial implantation site during inflammatory reaction. In this work, in vitro studies were conducted on an ultrastructural scale to determine the specific behavior of these cells with regard to a calcium phosphate (CaP) ceramic. Two types of phagocytosis were observed when cells came into contact with the biomaterial: either CaP crystals were taken up alone and then dissolved in the cytoplasm after disappearance of the phagosome membrane or they were incorporated together with large quantities of culture medium, in which case dissolution occurred after the formation of heterophagosomes. Phagocytosis of CaP coincided with autophagy and the accumulation of residual bodies in the cells. Addition of HILDA/LIF factor to these cultures induced a very marked decrease in phagocytotic activity directed at the capture of CaP crystals and culture medium. Autophagy was reduced, and residual bodies were rare or absent. This study specifies the role of monocytes in CaP biodegradation and demonstrates for the first time that HILDA/LIF has a biological effect on this cell line.', 8818866: 'Effect of isoflurane on the dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride to chloroform was investigated in the guinea-pig liver microsomes. Under anaerobic conditions, chloroform is produced from carbon tetrachloride through the microsomes in the presence of NADPH, and such production of chloroform was increased by the addition of isoflurane. The K(m) for the production of chloroform from carbon tetrachloride was decreased to 86% by isoflurane compared with the control; however the maximum velocity of chloroform production was also decreased to 50%. The formation of the 445 nm band in the mixture of reduced cytochrome P-450 and carbon tetrachloride, and cytochrome P-450 reduction by NADPH were both accelerated by isoflurane, without alteration of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity. These results indicate that trichloromethyl radical, an intermediate product of carbon tetrachloride, easily combines to the haeme part of cytochrome P-450, whereas the protein part combines to isoflurane after being reduced by NADPH, which results in acceleration of carbon tetrachloride dechlorination under a lower concentration of carbon tetrachloride. These results may have implications for other drugs that are administered during isoflurane anaesthesia.', 8882803: 'The inhibiting effect of 14 typical creosote compounds on the aerobic degradation of toluene was studied in batch experiments. Four NSO-compounds (pyrrole, 1-methylpyrrole, thiophene, and benzofuran) strongly inhibited the degradation of toluene. When the NSO-compounds were present together with toluene, little or no degradation of toluene was observed during 16 days of incubation, compared with a total removal of toluene within 4 days when the four compounds were absent. Indole (an N-compound) and three phenolic compounds (phenol, o-cresol, and 2,4-dimethylphenol) also inhibited the degradation of toluene, though the effect was much weaker that of the four NSO-compounds. O-xylene, p-xylene, naphthalene and 1-methylnaphthalene seemed to stimulate the degradation even though the influence was very weak. No effects of benzothiophene (an S-compound) and quinoline (an N-compound) were observed. Benzofuran (an O-compound) was identified as the compound that most inhibited the degradation of toluene. An effect could be detected even at low concentrations (40 micrograms/l).', 8933845: \"Laccase of Trametes versicolor was generally able to oxidize anthracene in vitro. After 72 h incubation about 35% of the anthracene was transformed stoichiometrically to 9,10-anthraquinone. Transformation of anthracene increased rapidly in the presence of different mediators that readily generate stable radicals: 2,2'-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. For the reaction, the presence of both the laccase and the mediator was necessary. In the presence of 0.005 mM 1-hydroxybenzotriazole this conversion had removed 47% of the anthracene after 72 h; 75% of the substrate was oxidized during this period when ABTS (1 mM) was used as mediator. In contrast to reactions without or with only low concentrations of a mediator, there was a discrepancy between the disappearance of anthracene and the formation of 9,10-anthraquinone in mediator-forced reactions. Coupling-products of mediators with anthracene degradation products were found. Anthracene disappeared nearly completely after incubation for 72 h with laccase in a 0.1 mM solution of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and was transformed to 9,10-anthraquinone in about 80% yield; 90% of the substrate was transformed in the presence of ABTS (2.0 mM) resulting again in 80% quinone. Phenothiazine was not effective in this system.\", 8978660: 'Different cell lines are involved during an immunological reaction, principally lymphocytes and monocytes. Monocyte/macrophage cells, which are among the first to appear in wound-healing and infection sites, are largely implicated in phagocytosis and could be involved in calcium-phosphate degradation. Their role in these processes may relate to cytokine secretions and/or their sensitivity to certain cytokines. We tested the behavior of human monocytes placed on the surface of biphasic calcium-phosphate (BCP) tablets in the presence of two lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations. After short-term culture (48 h), cytokine release (IL-1beta, IL-6) was measured by ELISA, and morphological cell events and biomaterial degradation were observed in scanning electron microscopy. BCP surface pits were noted near cells stimulated by 0.5 microg/mL LPS but were not apparent with 10 microg/mL LPS. The number of lacunae on BCP was increased after LPS treatment of human monocytes. An upmodulation of IL-1beta and IL-6 (in culture medium) released by LPS-activated human monocytes was observed, indicating good cell stimulation. This study demonstrates that LPS-activated human monocytes can degrade the surface of calcium-phosphate ceramic and confirms the role of human monocytes in biomaterial degradation.', 8987730: 'The effect of vitamins on the aerobic degradation and dechlorination of 2-chlorophenol and 4-chlorophenol by Pseudomonas pickettii, strain LD1, and 4-chlorobiphenyl by Pseudomonas sp. strain CPE1 was determined. These microorganisms are capable of using the target compounds as the sole carbon and energy source, but do not need vitamins to metabolize them. The addition to the culture medium of a vitamin solution containing biotin, folic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin, thiamine hydrochloride, niacin, pantothenic acid, cyanocobalamin, p-aminobenzoic acid, and thioctic acid (total final concentration: < or = 600 ppb) resulted in a 7%-16% increase in the amount of target compounds degraded over the incubation period required for the concentration of the compound in the cultures to drop to approximately zero. A corresponding increase in the amount of chloride ion produced was also detected during the same period, indicating active (and often stoichiometric) dechlorination of the target compounds.', 9150239: 'Nitrate is essential for lindane dechlorination by the cyanobacteria Anabaena sp. strain PCC7120 and Nostoc ellipsosporum, as it is for dechlorination of other organic compounds by heterotrophic microorganisms. Based on analyses of mutants and effects of environmental factors, we conclude that lindane dechlorination by Anabaena sp. requires a functional nir operon that encodes the enzymes for nitrate utilization.', 9293014: 'The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of low concentrations of a rhamnolipid biosurfactant on the in situ biodegradation of hydrocarbon entrapped in a porous matrix. Experiments were performed with sand-packed columns under saturated flow conditions with hexadecane as a model hydrocarbon. Application of biosurfactant concentrations greater than the CMC (the concentration at which the surfactant molecules spontaneously form micelles or vesicles [0.03 mM]) resulted primarily in the mobilization of hexadecane entrapped within the sand matrix. In contrast, application of biosurfactant concentrations less than the CMC enhanced the in situ mineralization of entrapped hexadecane; however, this effect was dependent on the choice of bacterial isolate. The two Pseudomonas isolates tested, R4 and ATCC 15524, were used because they exhibit different patterns of biodegradation of hexadecane, and they also differed in their physical response to rhamnolipid addition. ATCC 15524 cells formed extensive multicell aggregates in the presence of rhamnolipid while R4 cells were unaffected. This behavior did not affect the ability of the biosurfactant to enhance the biodegradation of hexadecane in well-mixed soil slurry systems but had a large affect on the extent of entrapped hexadecane biodegradation in the sand-packed-column system that was used in this study.', 9335050: 'Organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH) was displayed and anchored onto the surface of Escherichia coli using an Lpp-OmpA fusion system. Production of the fusion proteins in membrane fractions was verified by immunoblotting with OmpA antisera. Inclusion of the organophosphorus hydrolase signal sequence was necessary for achieving enzymatic activity on the surface. More than 80% of the OPH activity was located on the cell surface as determined by protease accessibility experiments. Whole cells expressing OPH on the cell surface degraded parathion and paraoxon very effectively without any diffusional limitation, resulting in sevenfold higher rates of parathion degradation compared with whole cells with similar levels of intracellular OPH. Immobilization of these live biocatalysts onto solid supports could provide an attractive means for pesticide detoxification in place of immobilized enzymes, affording a reduced diffusional barrier.', 9353904: 'Columns of an Alfisol under permanent pasture were polluted by repeated additions of pentachlorophenol (PCP) (7 mg l-1) to levels of 102 and 510 mg Kg-1, to simulate a dynamic diffuse pollution. PCP was rapidly sorbed to the soil organic matter, and was only slightly degraded. Measurements of soil microbial biomass-C revealed a 25% decrease in total biomass-C caused by both leaching and PCP toxicity. Microbial biomass-C measurements performed on soil fractions showed that only microorganisms located in the outer compartment of the aggregates were affected. Microorganisms protected by soil micro-aggregates were not affected, suggesting that they were not in contact with PCP, which was thus unavailable for biodegradation. Three gram negative bacterial strains (Si, C3 and C2), able to use PCP as a sole carbon and energy source, were isolated after 0, 1 and 3 months of PCP enrichment respectively, and were identified as Pseudomonas (Si) and Acinetobacter (C3 and C2). In liquid degradation tests, the strains C2 and C3 degraded 60% of PCP within 26 days whereas the Pseudomonas degraded only 25%. A specific immuno-labeling of the three strains permitted to show that repeated PCP additions to soil had a positive, negative or absence of effect on the populations C2, C3 and Si respectively.', 9472311: 'The Department of Defense (DoD) has over 21,000 contaminated sites requiring some form of remediation. Contaminants on these sites include explosive compounds (i.e., TNT, RDX, HMX), chlorinated solvents (i.e., PCE, TCE, TCA), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (i.e., benzo-a-pyrene), and polychlorinated biphenyls (i.e., aroclors). Current technology has centered around incineration, air stripping, and the use of activated carbon. Frequently, this technology is not cost effective nor publicly acceptable. Biotreatment offers a possible alternative. Biotreatment can cost effectively eliminate contaminants and avoid the use of harsh chemicals and physical treatments. However, special care must be employed to ensure that the proper remediation system is designed and engineered to optimize clean-up and minimize costs. Unfortunately, not all bioremediation efforts have been successful. In an attempt to develop bioremediation technology from the flask (bench scale) to the field (full-scale design), many scientists and engineers have failed to understand the phenomena that influence bioremediation. Issues such as additional mass transport mechanisms/limitations, the presence of multiple phases, spatial heterogeneities, and unfavorable factors for bacterial growth represent only a few of the phenomena that can limit or complicate biodegradation. Successful bioremediation requires a complete examination of the phenomena that can be observed as the scientist and engineer progress together from the bench to the field. An excellent way to examine these phenomena is by using the conceptual scales of observation: microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale. The microscale represents the level at which chemical/microbial species and reactions can be characterized independently of any transport phenomena. These activities are those occurring at the microbial cell level and generally are the focus of bench level work. The mesoscale is the level at which transport phenomena and system geometry are first apparent, with the exclusion of advective or mixing processes. This scale represents those activities that occur at the pore channel, soil particle or microbial aggregate level. The macroscale is the scale at which you have the ability to discern advective or mixing phenomena. These activities are generally associated on a site level and are the focus of the design engineer. The critical path as bioremediation technology is developed from flask to field is to observe and understand the phenomena that exert influence at each scale of observation so that its effects can be incorporated into the final remediation design.', 9615405: 'A direct ion chromatographic method of measuring carboxylic acids was modified and expanded to include measurement of eight components at parts-per-billion levels. These components, listed by eluting order, were acetate, propionate, formate, pyruvate, glyoxalate, dichloroacetate, oxalate and ketomalonate. The calculated method detection limits were 2-6 micrograms/l. Preliminary data were obtained by using California state project water from the filter influent of the Oxidation Demonstration Plant of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Oxalate was measured at levels above 200 micrograms/l, formate above 100 micrograms/l, acetate above 50 micrograms/l, pyruvate and glyoxalate at approximately 30 micrograms/l and propionate and ketomalonate at trace levels near the detection limits. This method utilizes a new preservative, benzalkonium chloride, as a substitute for the environmentally unsafe mercuric chloride that had previously been used. Preservation studies indicate that all eight compounds are stable for a testing period of 30 days when benzalkonium chloride is maintained at or above 30 mg/l in the water sample.', 9638523: 'Poly(etherurethane urea) (PEUU) elastomers, with their broad range of mechanical properties and high biocompatibility, are used clinically for medical applications. However, the possibility exists for the ether soft segment of PEUU to degrade in long-term uses. To retard degradation, antioxidants that scavenge reactive oxygen intermediates are added. In this study, we incorporated dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which functions by the alternate mechanism of modulating or down-regulating adherent macrophage activity, to retard the biodegradation of PEUUs. Biocompatibility of PEUU samples containing 1% DHEA, 5% DHEA, and 5% vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) by weight were studied in vivo and in vitro. The biocompatibility was initially evaluated by examination of the inflammatory cellular exudate. Compared to PEUU without additives and PEUU with 5% vitamin E, the addition of 5% DHEA to PEUU caused a decrease in the total leukocyte exudate concentration at 4 days. The addition of 5% DHEA also caused lower macrophage adhesion and FBGC formation compared to the other materials at 7 days. Despite these short-term effects, the biocompatibility at later time points (14, 21, and 70 days) was similar for all materials. Transmission infrared analysis of the materials revealed that more than 70% of the DHEA had leached out of the samples by 3 days implantation. Furthermore, through attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform analysis and scanning electron microscopy, it was determined that unlike vitamin E, DHEA did not enhance long-term PEUU biostability. The effect of DHEA on inflammatory cell activity appeared to be dose dependent, with improved biocompatibility in vivo for higher loading levels of DHEA, but the overall effect was limited owing to the rapid diffusion of the water-soluble DHEA from the PEUU.', 9638524: 'Biomaterials are increasingly used for clinical applications. However, loss of function may occur owing to tissue reactions, which are mainly caused by a variety of inflammatory reactions. Recently, we demonstrated that macrophages (MO) and T cells play key roles in these reactions. Since immunological studies showed that the T cell-derived cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) activates MO, the aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of modulating tissue reactions to biodegradable biomaterials by inactivating IFN-gamma. Dermal sheep collagen (DSC) was used as a test biomaterial. DSC impregnated with anti-IFN-gamma or phosphate-buffered saline (control) was implanted in rats. The results showed that cellular ingrowth and formation and function of giant cells were strongly delayed by anti-IFN-gamma. Also, MHC class II expression was strongly inhibited. In the treated DSC, some huge giant cells were formed at the interface but association with the DSC bundles did not occur. Finally, in both the control and treated DSC, T cells and NK cells were rarely detected. This study demonstrates that IFN-gamma plays an important role in the inflammatory reaction to biomaterials. This reaction can be modulated by anti-IFN-gamma, which warrants further studies of anti-IFN-gamma for clinical application to prevent unwanted tissue reactions to biomaterials.', 9812376: 'This study focused on the capacity of finished compost, often used as packing material in biofiltration units, to support microbial biodegradation of trichloroethylene (TCE). Finished compost was enriched with methane or propane (10% head space) to stimulate cometabolic biodegradation of gaseous TCE. Successful hydrocarbon enrichment, as indicated by rapid depletion of hydrocarbon gas and measurable growth of hydrocarbon-utilizing micro-organisms, occurred within a week. Within batch reactor flasks, approximately 75% of head space TCE (1-40 ppmv) was rapidly sorbed onto compost material. Up to 99% of the remaining head space TCE was removed via biodegradation in compost enriched with either hydrocarbon. Hydrocarbon enrichment with methane or propane corresponded to 10-fold increases in methanotrophic or propanotrophic populations, respectively. Based on growth assessment under different nutritional regimes, there appeared to be complex metabolic interactions within the microbial community in enriched compost. Five separate bacterial cultures were derived from the hydrocarbon-enriched compost and assayed for the ability to degrade TCE.', 9830101: 'The influence of ammonia on the anaerobic degradation of peptone by mesophilic and thermophilic populations of biowaste was investigated. For peptone concentrations from 5 g l-1 to 20 g l-1 the mesophilic population revealed a higher rate of deamination than the thermophilic population, e.g. 552 mg l-1 day-1 compared to 320 mg l-1 day-1 at 10 g l-1 peptone. The final degree of deamination of the thermophilic population was, however, higher: 102 compared to 87 mg NH3/g peptone in the mesophilic cultures. If 0.5-6.5 g l-1 ammonia was added to the mesophilic biowaste cultures, deamination of peptone, degradation of its chemical oxygen demand (COD) and formation of biogas were increasingly inhibited, but no hydrogen was formed. The thermophilic biowaste cultures were most active if around 1 g ammonia l-1 was present. Deamination, COD degradation and biogas production decreased at lower and higher ammonia concentrations and hydrogen was formed in addition to methane. Studies of the inhibition by ammonia of peptone deamination, COD degradation and methane formation revealed a Ki (50%) for NH3 of 92, 95 and 88 mg l-1 at 37 degrees C and 251, 274 and 297 mg l-1 at 55 degrees C respectively. This indicated that the thermophilic flora tolerated significantly more NH3 than the mesophilic flora. In the mesophilic reactor effluent 4.6 x 10(8) peptone-degrading colony-forming units (cfu)/ml were culturable, whereas in the thermophilic reactor effluent growth of only 5.6 x 10(7) cfu/ml was observed.', 9872765: 'Contamination of soils with toxic metals is a major problem on military, industrial, and mining sites worldwide. Of particular interest to the field of bioremediation is the selection of biological markers for the end point of remediation. In this microcosm study, we focus on the effect of addition of a mixture of toxic metals (cadmium, cobalt, cesium, and strontium as chlorides) to soil on the population structure and size of the ammonia oxidizers that are members of the beta subgroup of the Proteobacteria (beta-subgroup ammonia oxidizers). In a parallel experiment, the soils were also treated by the addition of five strains of metal-resistant heterotrophic bacteria. Effects on nitrogen cycling were measured by monitoring the NH3 and NH4+ levels in soil samples. The gene encoding the alpha-subunit of ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) was selected as a functional molecular marker for the beta-subgroup ammonia oxidizing bacteria. Community structure comparisons were performed with clone libraries of PCR-amplified fragments of amoA recovered from contaminated and control microcosms for 8 weeks. Analysis was performed by restriction digestion and sequence comparison. The abundance of ammonia oxidizers in these microcosms was also monitored by competitive PCR. All amoA gene fragments recovered grouped with sequences derived from cultured Nitrosospira. These comprised four novel sequence clusters and a single unique clone. Specific changes in the community structure of beta-subgroup ammonia oxidizers were associated with the addition of metals. These changes were not seen in the presence of the inoculated metal-resistant bacteria. Neither treatment significantly altered the total number of beta-subgroup ammonia-oxidizing cells per gram of soil compared to untreated controls. Following an initial decrease in concentration, ammonia began to accumulate in metal-treated soils toward the end of the experiment.', 9874346: 'Flavobacterium aurantiacum NRRL B-184 possesses the ability to degrade aflatoxin B1 in solution and in several food items. Aflatoxin B1 is a potent carcinogen that causes significant economic losses to the agricultural and food industry. The role of trace metal ions (Cu2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, and Co2+) were studied in an effort to understand the enzymatic system involved in aflatoxin B1 degradation by F aurantiacum. The effect of divalent chelators (EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline [OPT]) in the presence of the trace metal ions was studied as well. Aflatoxin B1 (10 microg/ml) was added to 72-h cultures of F aurantiacum that had been washed and resuspended in phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). HPLC was used to determine aflatoxin B1 concentration in these cultures. Incubating cells at 30 degrees C with 1 and 10 mM Cu2+, Mn2+, and Zn2+ significantly decreased aflatoxin B degradation after 4 and 24 h (P < 0.05). Decreased degradation was also observed with 1 and 10 mM Cu2+ and Zn2+ after 48 h and with 0.1 mM Cu2+ after 24 and 48 h. Co2+ did not have a significant effect on aflatoxin B1 degradation. EDTA and OPT did not counter the inhibition in the presence of Cu2+. The addition of 1 mM EDTA countered the inhibition by 1 mM Mn2+ after 4 and 24 h, but 1 mM OPT did not counter the inhibition by 10 mM Mn2+ after 4 and 24 h. OPT countered the inhibition by 1 mM Zn2+ after 4 and 48 h. These trace elements inhibit aflatoxin B1 degradation by F aurantiacum. In addition, their presence necessitates higher concentrations (>1 mM) of EDTA and OPT for the removal of their inhibitory effect.'}\n",
