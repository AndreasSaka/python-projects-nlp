Studies with cell extracts reveal the presence of inducible dehydrogenases for cyclohexanol, 6-hydroxyhexanoate and 6-oxohexanoate and a monooxygenase, that in conjunction with a lactonase converts cyclohexanone to 6-hydroxyhexanoate.', 
The monooxygenase is therefore presumed to be of the lactone-forming type and the pathway for conversion of cyclohexanol to adipate; cyclohexanol leads to cyclohexanone leads to 1-oxa-2-oxocycloheptane leads to 6-hydroxyhexanoate leads to 6-oxohexanoate leads to adipate; for which key intermediates have been identified chromatographically, is identical with the route for the oxidation of cyclohexanol by Nocardia globerula CL1.A mixed bacterial culture, consisting of a minimum of nine isolates, was adapted to growth on technical parathion (PAR) as a sole carbon and energy source.',

Extracts of m-cresol-grown cells also contained 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and hydrolase, whose specificities enable them to metabolize the ring-fission products from catechol, 3-methylcatechol, and 4-methylcatechol.', 
Extracts of these cells contained high levels of protocatechuate oxygenase and only small amounts of catechol oxygenase.In studying the transformation of diazepam (7-chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one) by fungi isolated from soil.',

Genetic studies have suggested that this monooxygenase consists of two different proteins, products of the xylA and xylM genes, which function as an electron-transfer protein and a terminal hydroxylase, respectively.', 
In this study, the electron-transfer component of xylene monooxygenase, the product of xylA, was purified to homogeneity.',

Nitration was not mediated by a free radical mechanism because hydroxyl radical scavengers did not reduce either superoxide dismutase or Fe3+EDTA-catalyzed nitration and nitrogen dioxide was not a significant product from either catalyst.', 
The reaction rate of peroxynitrite with bovine Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase was 10(5) M-1.s-1 at low superoxide dismutase concentrations, but the rate of nitration became independent of superoxide dismutase concentration above 10 microM with only 9% of added peroxynitrite yielding nitrophenol.', 
We propose that peroxynitrite anion is more stable in the cis conformation, whereas only a higher energy species in the trans conformation can fit in the active site of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase.', 
At high superoxide dismutase concentrations, phenolic nitration may be limited by the rate of isomerization from the cis to trans conformations of peroxynitrite as well as by competing pathways for peroxynitrite decomposition.',

The dehalogenase activity arises from two components, a 4-chlorobenzoate:CoA ligase-dehalogenase (an alpha beta dimer of the 57- and 30-kD polypeptides) and a thioesterase (the 16-kD polypeptide).Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 metabolizes toluene as a carbon source by a previously unknown pathway.', 
The initial step of the pathway is hydroxylation of toluene to form p-cresol by a multicomponent toluene-4-monooxygenase (T4MO) system.', 
DNA sequencing and N-terminal amino acid determination identified a five-gene cluster, tmoABCDE, within this region.', 
It was tentatively concluded that the tmoABCDE genes encode structural polypeptides of the T4MO enzyme system.',

The first one is identical with benzoate-CoA ligase (E1).', 
The second enzyme is a 2-aminobenzoate-CoA ligase (E2).', 
The enzymes E1 and E2 have similar activity levels; a third minor CoA ligase activity is due to a different 2-aminobenzoate-CoA ligase.', 
In order to determine the enzyme of toluene degradation that is responsible for TCE degradation, chemically induced mutants, blocked in the toluene ortho-monooxygenase (TOM) pathway of G4, were examined.',

Usage of the unusual arginine codons AGA and AGG appears to have been selected in the P. putida xylX gene as it diverged from the ancestor it shared with A. calcoaceticus benA.', 
Two gene clusters involved in the degradation of these compounds were identified on a catabolic plasmid, pP51, with a size of 110 kb by using hybridization.',

Microbes can detoxify organo-mercurials and mercury salts through sequential action of two enzymes, organomercury lyase and mercuric ion reductase (MerA).', 
The latter, a homodimer with homology to the FAD-dependent disulphide oxidoreductases, catalyses the reaction NADPH + Hg(II)----NADP+ + H+ + Hg(0), one of the very rare enzymic reactions with metal substrates.', 
Human glutathione reductase serves as a reference molecule for FAD-dependent disulphide reductases and between its primary structure and that of MerA from Tn501 (Pseudomonas), Tn21 (Shigella), p1258 (Staphylococcus) and Bacillus, 25-30% of the residues have been conserved.', 
We report here the crystal structure of MerA from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus sp.', 
The strain metabolized 2,4-D via p-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, p-chlorophenol and 4-chlorocatechol; the last metabolite was cleaved by catechol 1,2-dioxygenase.', 
The enzymes N-formylanthranilate deformylase, anthranilate hydroxylase, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, and catechol dioxygenase were induced by indole as early as after 5 h of growth, and their activities were demonstrated in a cell-free system.Enzymatic conversion of 4-fluorocatechol in the simultaneous presence of partially purified preparations of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas cepacia and muconate cycloisomerase from Alcaligenes eutrophus 335 yielded a product that was unambiguously identified as (+)-4-fluoromuconolactone .', 
This compound was shown to be the only major product formed from 3-fluoro-cis,cis-muconate by the action of muconate cycloisomerases from A. eutrophus 335, A. eutrophus JMP134, and P. cepacia as well as by the action of dichloromuconate cycloisomerase from A. eutrophus JMP134.', 
This finding implies that dichloromuconate cycloisomerase, like the muconate cycloisomerases, catalyzes primarily a cycloisomerization reaction, which only in the case of chloro- and bromo-substituted substrates is connected to a dehalogenation.', 
Participation of dienelactone hydrolases in this reaction is indicated by their induction during growth of various strains with 4-fluorobenzoate.', 
In light of these observations, earlier proposals for a 4-fluorobenzoate degradative pathway are discussed.We have investigated the substrate specificity of ammonia monooxygenase in whole cells of the nitrifying bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea for a number of aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons.',

5SS-grown cells exhibited high gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase activity.', 
ONP was converted by a nitrophenol oxygenase to nitrite and catechol.', 
Catechol was then attacked by a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and further degraded through an ortho-cleavage pathway.', 
Nitrophenol oxygenase of strain B2 is a soluble, NADPH-dependent enzyme that is stimulated by magnesium, manganese, and calcium ions.', 
In addition, 4-formyl-, 4-carboxy-, and 4-nitro-ONP failed to induce the formation of nitrophenol oxygenase.', 
Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase of strain B2 is active toward catechol and 4-methyl-catechol but only poorly active toward chlorinated catechols.', 
Thus, of the compounds tested, only unsubstituted ONP acts as an inducer and substrate for all of the enzymes of a productive catabolic pathway.5-Pyridoxic-acid oxygenase, a cytoplasmic enzyme formed when Arthrobacter Cr-7 is grown with pyridoxine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen, was purified about 190-fold to homogeneity from fully induced cells.', 
The enzyme catalyzes Reaction a, (Formula: see text) the essential ring-opening step in the degradation of pyridoxine, and provides a second example of an FAD-dependent oxygenase that adds both two hydrogen and two oxygen atoms to its substrate.', 
5-Pyridoxic-acid oxygenase has an isoelectric point of 4.6, functions optimally between pH 7 and 8, appears to contain a single subunit of Mr = 51,000 and one FAD (but no iron) per subunit, and is readily resolved by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at pH 3.0.', 
In addition, the failure to observe the activity in a group of gram-positive bacteria holds open the possibility that a periplasmic component may be required for in vivo expression of C-P lyase activity.Nitrile hydratase of Pseudomonas chlororaphis B23 was completely stabilized by the addition of 22 mM n-butyric acid.', 
The concentrated solution of highly purified nitrile hydratase had a pronounced greyish green color and exhibited a broad absorption in visible range with a absorption maxima at 720 nm.', 
PCA was converted by an aniline oxygenase to 4-chlorocatechol, which in turn was degraded via a modified ortho-cleavage pathway.', 
Synthesis of the aniline oxygenase was inducible by various anilines.', 
The initial enzyme of the modified ortho-cleavage pathway, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, had similar characteristics to those of corresponding enzymes of pathways for the degradation of chlorobenzoic acid and chlorophenol, that is, a broad substrate specificity and high activity towards chlorinated and methylated catechols.1.', 
This step was believed to be mediated by a new labile dioxygenase (t((1/2))=4h at pH7.0, 4 degrees C) cleaving the pyridine ring between C-2 and C-3.', 
Many of the properties of this pyridine-3,4-diol dioxygenase paralleled those of the extradiol (;meta\\') oxygenases of aromatic-ring cleavage.", 
The esterase hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and methyl acetate; however, enzymatic hydrolysis of phosphates, sulfates, dipeptides, lactones, or the ethyl esters of N-benzoyl-l-tyrosine could not be detected.', 
The apparent K(m) for esterase activity with p-nitrophenyl acetate as the substrate was 6.7 x 10(-5) M, and the maximal velocity (V) was 1,223 mumol/min per mg of protein at 30 C. With ethyl acetate as the substrate, the apparent K(m) was 3.6 x 10(-4) M and V was 1,026 mumol/min per mg of protein.',

The oxygenase was purified to homogeneity and had a molecular weight of 106,000.', 
The oxygenase was specific for NADPH as the electron donor and absolutely specific for the coenzyme A ester of 2-oxo-delta 3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetic acid as the substrate.', 
The reaction stoichiometry was compatible with this enzyme being a monooxygenase, and a mass spectral analysis of the methyl ester of the product confirmed the insertion of a single oxygen atom.', 
About 3 h later, when replicatory growth had ceased entirely, the sparsely branched mycelia (length, approximately equal to 550 microns) began the rapid synthesis of a later pathway enzyme, m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase.', 
The age at which a culture produced m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase was increased by increasing the nutrient nitrogen content of the medium or by decreasing the size of the spore inoculum.',

In contrast, naphthalene dioxygenase of Pseudomonas sp.', 
1-Hydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene was not formed by strains expressing naphthalene dioxygenase.', 
We propose that propylene oxide metabolism in Xanthobacter strain Py2 proceeds by terminal carboxylation of an isomerization intermediate, which, in the absence of CO2, is released as acetone.Studies on the sulfoxidation of aryl alkyl sulfides by purified toluene dioxygenase and naphthalene dioxygenase showed that naphthalene dioxygenase produces sulfoxides of (S) absolute configuration in high enantiomeric purity while those formed by toluene dioxygenase are of variable enantiomeric purity depending on the p-substituents on the benzene ring.', 
Oxygen uptake experiments with naphthalene dioxygenase showed that the reaction rate and degree of oxygen incorporation are affected by both aryl and alkyl substituents.', 
18O2-Incorporation experiments showed that the oxygen atom of methyl phenyl sulfoxide formed by toluene dioxygenase and naphthalene dioxygenase is derived exclusively from O2.', 
The carboxylation did not require ATP.The stereospecific oxidation of indan and indene was examined with mutant and recombinant strains expressing naphthalene dioxygenase of Pseudomonas sp.', 
Purified naphthalene dioxygenase oxidized indan to the same four products formed by strains 9816/11 and JM109(DE3).', 
The major products formed from indene by purified naphthalene dioxygenase were (+)-(1S)-indenol and (+)-(1R,2S)-indandiol.', 
The results show that naphthalene dioxygenase catalyzes the enantiospecific monooxygenation of indan to (+)-(1S)-indanol and the desaturation of indan to indene, which then serves as a substrate for the formation of (+)-(1R,2S)-indandiol and (+)-(1S)-indenol.', 
The relationship of the desaturase, monooxygenase, and dioxygenase activities of naphthalene dioxygenase is discussed with reference to reactions catalyzed by toluene dioxygenase, plant desaturases, cytochrome P-450, methane monooxygenase, and other bacterial monooxygenases.We cloned the genes from Corynebacterium sp.',

Two other enzymes, the alcohol dehydrogenase and the haloacid dehalogenase, are chromosomally encoded.', 
Sequence analysis indicates that the haloacid dehalogenase belongs to the L-specific 2-chloroproprionic acid dehalogenases.',

A 1.96-kb EcoRI-SphI region located 1.9-kb downstream of the L-NHase gene was found to be essential for the expression of amidase activity in Escherichia coli; the gene arrangement of the amidase and the NHase in R. rhodochrous J1 differed from those in Rhodococcus species including N-774 and Pseudomonas chlororaphis B23.', 
The nucleotide-determined sequence indicated that the amidase consists of 515 amino acids (54626 Da) and the deduced amino acid sequence of the amidase had high similarity to those of amidases from Rhodococcus species including N-774 and P. chlororaphis B23 and to indole-3-acetamide hydrolase from Pseudomonas savastanoi.', 
The amidase gene modified in the nucleotide sequence upstream from its start codon expressed 8% of the total soluble protein in E. coli under the control of lac promoter.', 
The level of amidase activity in cell-free extracts of E. coli was 0.468 unit/mg using benzamide as a substrate.', 
This amidase was purified to homogeneity from extracts of the E. coli transformant with 30.4% overall recovery.', 
This amidase was highly specific for the S-enantiomer of 2-phenylpropionamide, but could not recognize the configuration of 2-chloropropionamide.', 
It also catalyzed the transfer of an acyl group from an amide to hydroxylamine to produce the corresponding hydroxamate.The biotransformation of 1-indanone and 2-indanone to hydroxyindanones was examined with bacterial strains expressing naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) and toluene dioxygenase (TDO) as well as with purified enzyme components.',

3-Vinylcatechol accumulated when intact cells were incubated with styrene in the presence of 3-fluorocatechol to inhibit catechol dioxygenase activity.', 
Experiments with 18O2 showed that 3-vinylcatechol was produced following a dioxygenase ring attack.', 
3-Vinylcatechol was cleaved by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase to give a yellow compound, tentatively identified as 2-hydroxy-6-oxoocta-2,4,7-trienoic acid, and the action of 2-hydroxymuconic acid semialdehyde hydrolase on this produced acrylic acid.', 
A 2AS dioxygenase system and a 3SC-2,3-dioxygenase (3SC23O) were detected in 2AS-grown cells only.', 
In both BS- and TS-grown cells a dioxygenase system for BS and TS was observed as well as a principal catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O-III), neither of which was present in 2AS-grown cells.', 
The 2AS dioxygenase system could cause not only deamination of 2AS but also desulphonation of BS and TS.', 
The BS dioxygenase could desulphonate BS and apparently either desulphonate or deaminate 2AS.', 
One operon encodes at least the 2AS dioxygenase system and 3SC23O whereas the other encodes at least the BS/TS dioxygenase system and C23O-III.The degradation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) by Moraxella and Pseudomonas spp.',

At the nucleotide level, doxABD are identical to the ndoABC genes that encode naphthalene dioxygenase of Pseudomonas putida.', 
The DoxG protein is 97% identical to NahC (1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase) of P. putida.', 
Our findings indicate that a single genetic pathway controls the metabolism of dibenzothiophene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene in strain C18 and that the DOX sequence encodes a complete upper naphthalene catabolic pathway similar to NAH.The Alcaligenes eutrophus 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate/alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, encoded by the tfdA gene of plasmid pJP4, is an Fe(II)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate to 2,4-dichlorophenol and glyoxylate concomitant with the decomposition of alpha-ketoglutarate to form succinate and carbon dioxide (Fukumori, F., and Hausinger, R. P. (1993) J. Bacteriol.', 
Using recombinant Escherichia coli cells that overexpress the tfdA gene, the thermolabile enzyme (stable only up to 30 degrees C) was purified to apparent homogeneity (specific activity of 16.9 mumol of substrate converted min-1 mg of protein-1) by a simple two-step procedure.', 
Ascorbic acid stimulates dioxygenase activity and reduces the rate of enzyme inactivation by a metal ion-mediated process.',

These plasmids have homologous regions of upper and lower NAH7 plasmid catabolic genes.', 
By conjugation experiments, these plasmids, including NAH7, have been shown to encode the genotype for mineralization of phenanthrene and anthracene, as well as naphthalene.', 
Two isofunctional, monomeric flavoproteins (components A1 and A2; M(r) of about 44,000) transferred electrons from NADH to the second component (B; M(r) of about 12,000), a ferredoxin, which transported electrons to the heteromultimeric (alpha 2 beta 2) oxygenase component (C; M(r) of alpha, 45,000; M(r) of beta, 23,000).',

strain RJGII-135 support the dioxygenase enzymatic processes reported previously for other bacteria.',

P. fluorescens MBER was found to initiate the degradation of ecgonine methyl ester via ecgonine, pseudoecgonine, and pseudoecgonyl-coenzyme A. Subcellular studies resulted in the identification of an ecgonine methyl esterase, an ecgonine epimerase, and a pseudoecgonyl-coenzyme A synthetase which were induced by growth on ecgonine methyl ester or ecgonine.', 
In addition to the ligase and reductive dehalogenase activities, hydrolytic 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase and thioesterase activities, 4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monooxygenase, and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase activities were demonstrated to be present in the soluble fraction of KZ-4 extracts following ultracentrifugation.', 
The first enzymes of the pathway, the chlorobenzene dioxygenase and the cis-chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, are encoded on a plasmid-located transposon Tn5280.', 
Chlorobenzene dioxygenase is a four-protein complex, formed by the gene products of tcbAa for the large subunit of the terminal oxygenase, tcbAb for the small subunit, tcbAc for the ferredoxin, and tcbAd for the NADH reductase.', 
Directly downstream of tcbAd is the gene for the cis-chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, tcbB.', 
Similar to the tod-encoded enzymes, chlorobenzene dioxygenase and cis-chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase were capable of oxidizing 1,2-dichlorobenzene, toluene, naphthalene, and biphenyl, but not benzoate, to the corresponding dihydrodiol and dihydroxy intermediates.', 
These data strongly suggest that the chlorobenzene dioxygenase and dehydrogenase originated from a toluene or benzene degradation pathway, probably by horizontal gene transfer.', 
The first three genes, cmtAaAbAc, and the sixth gene, cmtAd, encode the components of p-cumate 2,3-dioxygenase (ferredoxin reductase, large subunit of the terminal dioxygenase, small subunit of the terminal dioxygenase, and ferredoxin, respectively); these genes are separated by cmtC, which encodes 2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate 3,4-dioxygenase, and cmtB, coding for 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydro-p-cumate dehydrogenase.', 
The next four genes, cmtEFHG, encode 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate hydrolase, 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate hydratase, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, respectively, which transform the decarboxylation product to amphibolic intermediates.',

One mol of dehalogenase contained 1.0 mol of corrinoid, 9.8 mol of iron, and 8.0 mol of acid-labile sulfur.', 
Chlorinated methanes severely inhibited PCE dehalogenase activity.The polyether-macrolide antibiotic, boromycin, was isolated as a potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibiotic from a fermentation broth of Streptomyces sp.', 
Benzoyl-CoA is then reduced to non-aromatic products by benzoyl-CoA reductase.', 
A hypothetical degradation pathway for the anaerobic oxidation of toluene to benzoyl-CoA via an initial addition of fumarate to the methyl group of toluene and following beta-oxidation of the benzylsuccinate formed is suggested.Purified naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) from Pseudomonas sp.', 
These results are compared with similar reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P-450.The oxidation of 9,10-dihydroanthracene and 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene was examined with mutant and recombinant strains expressing naphthalene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida (NCIB 9816.4.', 
The major reaction catalyzed by naphthalene dioxygenase with 9,10-dihydroanthracene and 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene was stereospecific dihydroxylation in which both of the previously undescribed cis-diene diols were of R configuration at the benzylic center adjacent to the bridgehead carbon atom.', 
Hence, it is identified as a sulfide/sulfoxide monooxygenase.', 
This monooxygenase is similar to the microsomal flavin-containing monooxygenase but is unique among microbial flavomonooxygenases in its ability to catalyze two consecutive monooxygenation reactions.Initial reactions in anaerobic oxidation of ethylbenzene were investigated in a denitrifying bacterium, strain EB1.', 
Therefore, this new isolate has been named Sulfobacillus disulfidooxidans and has been assigned ATCC number 51911.The regio- and stereospecific oxidation of fluorene, dibenzofuran, and dibenzothiophene was examined with mutant and recombinant strains expressing naphthalene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp.', 
Induced cells of both strains, as well as the purified dioxygenase, also oxidized dibenzothiophene to (+)-(1R,2S)-cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1, 2-dihydrodibenzothiophene (84 to 87% yield; > 95% ee) and dibenzothiophene sulfoxide (< 15% yield).', 
The major reaction catalyzed by naphthalene dioxygenase with each substrate was stereospecific dihydroxylation in which the cis-dihydrodiols were of identical regiochemistry and of R configuration at the benzylic center adjacent to the bridgehead carbon atom.', 
The results indicate that although the absolute stereochemistry of the cis-diene diols was the same, the nature of the bridging atom or heteroatom influenced the regiospecificity of the reactions catalyzed by naphthalene dioxygenase.Bacterial strains expressing naphthalene, biphenyl, and toluene dioxygenase were examined for their abilities to oxidize 6,7-dihydro-5H-benzocycloheptene (benzocyclohept-1-ene).', 
In contrast, Pseudomonas putida F39/D expressing toluene dioxygenase oxidized benzocyclohept-1-ene to (+)-(5R)-hydroxybenzocyclohept-1-ene (> 98% ee, 90% yield) as the major metabolite and to the "opposite" diol, (+)-(1S,2R)-cis-dihydroxybenzocycloheptane (> 98% ee, 10% yield).', 
The results indicate that, for benzocyclohept-1-ene, the major reaction catalyzed by naphthalene and biphenyl dioxygenases is dioxygenation whereas toluene dioxygenase catalyzes mainly R-stereospecific benzylic monooxygenation.', 
The initial reactions are catalyzed by a NADPH- and flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent styrene monooxygenase, a styrene oxide isomerase, and a NAD(+)-dependent phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase.', 
The reduced CO-difference spectrum of microsomal preparations of styrene-grown cells shows a characteristic absorption maximum at 450 nm, which strongly suggests the involvement of a cytochrome P-450-dependent styrene monooxygenase.', 
Inhibition of styrene monooxygenase activity in cell extracts by cytochrome P-450 inhibitors SKF-525-A, metyrapone, and CO confirms this assumption.Pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase, which reductively liberates nitrite from nitrate esters, is related to old yellow enzyme.', 
The initial step in the biodegradative pathway of MSA in strain M2 involved an inducible NADH-specific monooxygenase enzyme (MSAMO).', 
In Chelatobacter heintzii ATCC 29600, biodegradation of NTA is initiated by NTA monooxygenase that oxidizes NTA to iminodiacetate and glyoxylate.', 
The NTA monooxygenase activity requires two component proteins, component A and component B, but the function of each component is unclear.', 
The NmoA sequence was similar to a monooxygenase that uses reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2) as reductant; NmoB was similar to an NADH:flavin mononucleotide (FMN) oxidoreductase.', 
Component A is therefore an NTA monooxygenase that uses FMNH2 and O2 to oxidize NTA, and component B is an NADH:FMN oxidoreductase that provides FMNH2 for NTA oxidation.Identification of new metabolites and demonstration of key enzyme activities support and extend the pathways previously reported for fluorene metabolism by Arthrobacter sp.', 
Crude extracts from fluorene-induced cells showed 3,4-dihydrocoumarin hydrolase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activities.', 
strain ADP, which contains the atzA gene, encoding the first metabolic step for the degradation of the herbicide atrazine (M. de Souza, L. P. Wackett, K. L. Boundy-Mills, R. T. Mandelbaum, and M. J. Sadowsky, Appl.', 
In this study, we show that this fragment also contained the second gene of the atrazine metabolic pathway, atzB.', 
Tn5 mutagenesis of pMD1 was used to determine that atzB was located 8 kb downstream of atzA.', 
ORF1 was identified as the coding region of atzB by demonstrating that (i) only ORF1 was transcribed in Pseudomonas sp.', 
The atzA and atzB genes catalyze the first two steps of the metabolic pathway in a bacterium that rapidly metabolizes atrazine to carbon dioxide, ammonia, and chloride.Streptomyces viridifaciens MG456-hF10 produces the antitumor agent valanimycin, which is a member of a family of antibiotics containing the azoxy group.', 
The requirement for molecular oxygen and a reduced flavin indicates that the N-hydroxylase is a flavin monooxygenase and that the mechanism for the hydroxylation is likely to proceed via the formation of a flavin 4a-hydroperoxide.', 
The results indicated that 2-MN induces pulmonary alveolar proteinosis but does not possess unequivocal carcinogenic potential in B6C3F1 mice.A recombinant Escherichia coli strain which expresses naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) from Pseudomonas sp.', 
1,4-Dichlorobenzene was attacked by a chlorobenzene dioxygenase, and the intermediate chlorocatechol was metabolized by the modified ortho pathway.', 
Furthermore, 1,3-dichlorobenzene did not induce chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase activity of the organism.', 
Chlorobenzene, however, induced chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase, dienelactone hydrolase, and maleylacetate reductase activities.', 
As demonstrated by chloride release, also chlorobenzene dioxygenase, chlorobenzene cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and chloromuconate cycloisomerase activities were present in chlorobenzene-induced cells, but chlorobenzene failed to support growth.', 
Thus, cymAa and cymAb encode the two components of p-cymene monooxygenase, a hydroxylase and a reductase, respectively; cymB encodes p-cumic alcohol dehydrogenase; cymC encodes p-cumic aldehyde dehydrogenase; cymD encodes a putative outer membrane protein related to gene products of other aromatic hydrocarbon catabolic operons, but having an unknown function in p-cymene catabolism; and cymE encodes an acetyl coenzyme A synthetase whose role in this pathway is also unknown.', 
Amino acid sequence similarity of the epoxide hydrolase with eukaryotic epoxide hydrolases, haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10, and bromoperoxidase A2 from Streptomyces aureofaciens indicated that it belonged to the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family.', 
This unique extradiol dioxygenase, CarB, had significantly higher affinity and about 20-times-higher meta-cleavage activity for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl than for catechol derivatives.', 
Bunz and Cook have reported the purification and characterization of this dioxin dioxygenase and a ferredoxin able to transfer electrons to the dioxygenase .', 
RW1 does not appear to be directly linked with the dioxin dioxygenase genes.', 
Thus, this report provides clear evidence that a putidaredoxin-type  ferredoxin, namely Fdx1, is able to transfer electrons to the dioxin dioxygenase of Sphingomonas sp.', 
In this study, the third gene in the atrazine catabolic pathway, atzC, was cloned from a Pseudomonas sp.', 
The atzC gene was further delimited by functional analysis following transposon Tn5 mutagenesis and subcloned as a 2.0-kb EcoRI-AvaI fragment.', 
AtzC showed modest sequence identity of 29 and 25%, respectively, to cytosine deaminase and dihydroorotase, both members of an amidohydrolase protein superfamily.', 
AtzC is thus assigned to the amidohydrolase protein family that includes cytosine deaminase, urease, adenine deaminase, and phosphotriester hydrolase.', 
Similar sequence comparisons of the most highly conserved regions indicated that the AtzA and AtzB proteins also belong to the same amidohydrolase family.', 
This indicates that the oxygen atom of acetone was derived from molecular oxygen, not from water; hence, the enzyme is an oxygenase.', 
The reaction stoichiometry was 2CH3CH(NO2)CH3 + O2-->2CH3COCH3 + 2HNO2, which is identical to that of the reaction of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from Hansenula mrakii.', 
Tungstate, a specific antagonist of molybdate, inhibited growth on thiophene-2-carboxylate at concentrations > 10(-7) M. Three inducible enzymes involved in the metabolism of thiophene-2-carboxylate were detected: an ATP-, CoA-, thiophene-2-carboxylate- and Mg2+-dependent thiophene-2-carboxyl-CoA ligase (AMP-forming), a molybdenum-containing thiophene-2-carboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and a thiophene-2-carboxyl-CoA thioesterase.', 
Limited degradation of acenaphthene could be attributed to its oxidation by naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase or related dioxygenases, indicative of certain limitations of the undefined mixed culture with respect to acenaphthene catabolism.', 
Sequence comparisons revealed that while hcaA1A2CD genes encode the four subunits of the 3-phenylpropionate dioxygenase, the hcaB gene codes for the corresponding cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase.', 
Neither monooxygenase has a tightly bound cofactor and each requires an NADH-FMN oxidoreductase for activity.', 
The strain metabolized the aldoxime as follows: E-pyridine-3-aldoxime was dehydrated to form 3-cyanopyridine, which was converted to nicotinamide by a nitrile hydratase, and the nicotinamide was successively hydrolyzed to nicotinic acid by an amidase.Enterobacter cloacae PB2 was originally isolated on the basis of its ability to utilize nitrate esters, such as pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and glycerol trinitrate, as the sole nitrogen source for growth.', 
This organism produced at least three different dehalogenases: a hydrolytic haloalkane dehalogenase specific for haloalkanes and two 3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenases, one specific for cis-3-chloroacrylic acid and the other specific for trans-3-chloroacrylic acid.', 
The haloalkane dehalogenase and the trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase were expressed constitutively, whereas the cis-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase was inducible.', 
The haloalkane dehalogenase gene, which is involved in the conversion of 1,3-dichloropropene to 3-chloroallyl alcohol, was cloned and sequenced, and this gene turned out to be identical to the previously studied dhaA gene of the gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus rhodochrous NCIMB13064.', 
Mutants resistant to the suicide substrate 1,2-dibromoethane lacked haloalkane dehalogenase activity and therefore could not utilize haloalkanes for growth.', 
The transient excretion of tetrachlorocatechol in the early growth phase suggests an initial attack by a dioxygenase to form the corresponding dihydrodiol which rearomatizes to the catechol.', 
The activity of chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase in crude cell extracts was found to be extraordinarily high towards 3-chlorocatechol (ratio of 2.6 compared to catechol) and other chlorocatechols, including tetrachlorocatechol, which was transformed at a low but significant rate.', 
In both cases, the activity of an INH amidase is required to hydrolyze an amide bond.', 
In the present study, using a model of INH-induced hepatotoxicity in rabbits, pretreatment of rabbits with the amidase inhibitor bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate 30 min before injection of INH inhibited the formation of INH-derived hydrazine and decreased measures of hepatocellular damage, hepatic triglyceride accumulation, and hypertriglyceridemia.', 
In conclusion, this study demonstrates the importance of amidase activity in this rabbit model of hepatotoxicity and provides additional evidence in support of the role of hydrazine in the mechanism of INH-induced hepatotoxicity.2,4,6-Trinitrophenol (picric acid) and 2,4-dinitrophenol were readily biodegraded by the strain Nocardioides simplex FJ2-1A.', 
In the presence of coenzyme A and ATP this acid is converted further, and this finding, together with the high levels of isocitrate lyase activity in extracts of limonene-grown cells, suggests that further degradation takes place via the beta-oxidation pathway.The microbial degradation of low-molecular-weight polydimethylsiloxanes was investigated through laboratory experiments.', 
Cyanuric acid amidohydrolase cleaves cyanuric acid (2,4,6-trihydroxy-s-triazine), which yields carbon dioxide and biuret; the biuret is subject to further metabolism, which yields CO(2) and ammonia.', 
The trzD gene encoding cyanuric acid amidohydrolase was cloned into pMMB277 from Pseudomonas sp.', 
DEAE and hydrophobic interaction HPLC were used to purify cyanuric acid amidohydrolase to homogeneity, and a spectrophotometric assay for the purified enzyme was developed.', 
Neither the nucleotide sequence of trzD nor the amino acid sequence of the gene product exhibited a significant level of similarity to any known gene or protein.Pseudomonas aeruginosa W51D is able to grow by using branched-chain dodecylbenzene sulfonates (B-DBS) or the terpenic alcohol citronellol as a sole source of carbon.', 
Both the haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 (DhlA) and that from Rhodococcus sp.', 
Broad-host-range dehalogenase expression plasmids, based on RSF1010 derivatives, were constructed with the haloalkane dehalogenase from Rhodococcus sp.', 
A catabolic pathway for trihalopropanes was designed by introducing these broad-host-range dehalogenase expression plasmids into Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1, which has the ability to utilize dihalogenated propanols for growth.', 
The recombinant strain AD1(pTB3), expressing the haloalkane dehalogenase gene under the control of the dhlA promoter, was able to utilize both 1,2,3-tribromopropane and 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane as sole carbon sources.', 
Moreover, increased expression of the haloalkane dehalogenase resulted in elevated resistance to trihalopropanes.Two strains of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA)-degrading bacteria, TA5 and TA27, were isolated from soil and identified as Mycobacterium spp.', 
The viability of immobilized cells increased 34-fold after 120 days of bioreactor operation.Many enteric bacteria express a type I oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase, which reduces nitro groups on many different nitroaromatic compounds under aerobic conditions.', 
This study indicates that nitramine reduction in enteric bacteria is carried out by the type I, or oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase, rather than a type II enzyme.', 
The enteric bacterium Morganella morganii strain B2 with documented hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) nitroreductase activity, and Enterobacter cloacae strain 96-3 with documented 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) nitroreductase activity, were used here to show that the explosives TNT and RDX were both reduced by a type I nitroreductase.', 
Morganella morganii and E. cloacae exhibited RDX and TNT nitroreductase activities in whole cell assays.', 
Type I nitroreductase, purified from E. cloacae, oxidized NADPH with TNT or RDX as substrate.', 
When expression of the E. cloacae type I nitroreductase gene was induced in an Escherichia coli strain carrying a plasmid, a simultaneous increase in TNT and RDX nitroreductase activities was observed.', 
In addition, neither TNT nor RDX nitroreductase activity was detected in nitrofurazone-resistant mutants of M. morganii.', 
We conclude that a type I nitroreductase present in these two enteric bacteria was responsible for the nitroreduction of both types of explosive.Arthrobacter protophormiae strain RKJ100 is capable of utilizing p-nitrophenol (PNP) as well as 4-nitrocatechol (NC) as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy.', 
Phenol hydroxylase of R. opacus 1G exhibited a previously undescribed catalytic pattern, catalyzing oxidative dehalogenation of 2,3,5-trichlorophenol with the formation of 3,5-dichloropyrocatechol but not hydroxylation of the nonsubstituted position 6.Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes POB310 contains genes that encode phenoxybenzoate dioxygenase.', 
These data indicated that a cytochrome-P450-dependent monooxygenase is involved in the degradation of the three cyclic amines.Thioacetamide (TA)-induced hepatotoxicity is potentiated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.', 
Hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) form 1 expression and methimazole-dependent oxidation of thiocholine were induced 2.5- and 1.8-fold in the diabetic rat, respectively.', 
In the STZ-induced diabetic rat, diabetes-induced CYP2E1 appears to be responsible for the potentiated liver injury; Even though hepatic FMO1 is induced in the diabetic rat, it is unlikely to mediate the potentiated TA hepatotoxicity.Transfer of the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) degradation plasmids pEMT1 and pJP4 from an introduced donor strain, Pseudomonas putida UWC3, to the indigenous bacteria of two different horizons (A horizon, depth of 0 to 30 cm; B horizon, depth of 30 to 60 cm) of a 2,4-D-contaminated soil was investigated as a means of bioaugmentation.', 
With plasmid pEMT1, this enhanced degradation seemed to be due only to transconjugants (10(5) CFU/g of soil), since the donor was already undetectable when degradation started.', 
We have demonstrated that overproduction of Rv3855 (EtaR), a putative regulatory protein from MTb, confers ETA resistance whereas overproduction of an adjacent, clustered monooxygenase (Rv3854c, EtaA) confers ETA hypersensitivity.', 
A pathway for 2-nitrobenzoate degradation in KU-7 was proposed.An arylketone monooxygenase was purified from Pseudomonas putida JD1 by ion exchange and affinity chromatography.', 
It had the characteristics of a Baeyer-Villiger-type monooxygenase and converted its substrate, 4-hydroxyacetophenone, into 4-hydroxyphenyl acetate with the consumption of one molecule of oxygen and oxidation of one molecule of NADPH per molecule of substrate.', 
The N-terminal sequence did not show any similarity to other proteins, but an internal sequence was very similar to part of the proposed NADPH binding site in the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase cyclohexanone monooxygenase from an Acinetobacter sp.Anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene was investigated with a sulfate-reducing enrichment culture.',

However, mRNA profiles indicated that all transcribed tfdA sequences were class III genes while rdpA transcripts shared 100% identity to rdpA of Delftia acidovorans MC1 and sdpA transcripts shared 100% identity to sdpA from Sphingomonas herbicidovorans MH.', 
Quantitative PCR revealed that the abundance of atzB and atzC genes relative to total bacteria decreased by a factor of 3-4 following the increase in atrazine concentration, while the relative abundance of trzD increased significantly (e28988400 times).', 
The gene encoding the propanil hydrolase responsible for transforming propanil into 3,4-DCA was cloned from Y57 and was designated as prpH.', 
To our knowledge, this is the first report of a strain that can degrade both propanil and 3,4-DCA and the first identification of a gene encoding a propanil hydrolase in bacteria.The soil bacterial isolate Variovorax sp.', 
Differential proteomic analysis showed a linuron-dependent upregulation of several enzymes that fit into this pathway, including an amidase (LibA), a multicomponent chloroaniline dioxygenase, and enzymes associated with a modified chlorocatechol ortho-cleavage pathway.', 
Purified LibA is a monomeric linuron hydrolase of e288bc55 kDa with a K(m) and a V(max) for linuron of 5.8 cebcM and 0.16 nmol mine281bbc2b9, respectively.', 
This novel member of the amidase signature family is unrelated to phenylurea-hydrolyzing enzymes from Gram-positive bacteria and lacks activity toward other tested phenylurea herbicides.', 
Orthologues of libA are present in all other tested linuron-degrading Variovorax strains with the exception of Variovorax strains WDL1 and PBS-H4, suggesting divergent evolution of the linuron catabolic pathway in different Variovorax strains.', 
Our study provides the first report on the genetic organization of a bacterial pathway for complete mineralization of a phenylurea herbicide and the first report on a linuron hydrolase in Gram-negative bacteria.A metagenomic analysis of two aquifer systems located under a dairy farming region was performed to examine to what extent the composition and function of microbial communities varies between confined and surface-influenced unconfined groundwater ecosystems.', 
atzA and trzN gene quantification confirmed partly the growth and decay of the atrazine degrading populations in the soil and suggested that especially trzN bearing populations are the dominant atrazine degrading populations in both topsoil and deeper soil.', 
In this study, a novel esterase gene, sulE, responsible for sulfonylurea herbicide de-esterification, was cloned from Hansschlegelia zhihuaiae S113.', 
ce94sulE lost the de-esterification ability and was more sensitive to the herbicides than the wild type of strain S113, suggesting that sulE played a vital role in the sulfonylurea herbicide resistance of the strain.', 
The transfer of sulE into Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 conferred on it the ability to de-esterify sulfonylurea herbicides and increased its resistance to the herbicides.', 
In the coming decades, more of these EOCs are likely to have drinking water standards, environmental quality standards and/or groundwater threshold values defined, and therefore a better understanding of the spatial and temporal variation remains a priority.libA, a gene encoding a novel type of linuron hydrolase, was recently identified in the linuron-mineralizing Variovorax sp.', 
In order to assess the contribution of libA to linuron degradation in environmental settings, libA abundance was monitored in response to the application of linuron and to environmental perturbations in agricultural soil microcosms and microcosms simulating the matrix of on-farm biopurification systems.', 
libA numbers were measured by real-time PCR and linked to reported data of Variovorax community composition and linuron mineralization capacity.', 
In the soil microcosms and one biopurification system setup, libA numbers responded to the application of linuron and environmental changes in congruency with the modulation of linuron mineralization capacity and the occurrence of a particular Variovorax phylotype (phylotype A).', 
Our data suggest that in the simulated environmental settings, the occurrence of libA can be linked to the linuron mineralization capacity and that libA is primarily hosted by Variovorax phylotype A strains.', 
However, the results also suggest that, apart from libA, other, as-yet-unknown isofunctional genes play an important role in linuron mineralization in the environment.Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been detected in bodies of water worldwide, yet their effects on the environment are not fully understood.', 
This was corroborated by the methanogenesis functional gene mcrA, which was 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than the FTHFS functional gene for homoacetogens.', 
A gene, ampA, encoding a novel arylamidase that catalyzes the amide bond cleavage in the amide pesticides was cloned from the strain.', 
ampA contains a 1,395-bp open reading frame that encodes a 465-amino-acid protein.', 
Prior and subsequent to the mineralization event, tfdA genes were quantified using real-time PCR to estimate the genetic potential for degrading PA in the soils.', 
Elevated concentrations of tfdA in the range 1 c397 10(5) to 5 c397 10(7) gene copies g(-1) of soil were observed in soils where mineralization could be described by using growth-linked kinetic models.', 
Finally, for 2,4-D mineralization, all seven mineralization patterns which were best fitted by the exponential model yielded a higher tfdA gene potential after mineralization had occurred than the three mineralization patterns best fitted by the Lin model.Despite the implication of anaerobic soil communities in important functions related to C and N biogeochemical cycles, their responses to pesticides are rarely assessed.', 
porous membranes in MBRs (micro- or ultrafiltration) and dense membrane applications (NF and RO) for water reuse.A real-time quantitative PCR method was developed to detect and quantify phenlylurea hydrolase genes\\' (puhA and puhB) sequences from environmental DNA samples to assess diuron-degrading genetic potential in some soil and sediment microbial communities.", 
In the soil communities, mineralization rates (determined with -labeled diuron) were linked to diuron-degrading genetic potentials estimated from puhB number copies, which increased following repeated diuron treatments.', 
In the sediment communities, mineralization potential did not depend solely on the quantity of puhB copies, underlining the need to assess gene expression.', 
In the sediment samples, both puhB copy numbers and mineralization capacities were highly conditioned by whether or not diuron-treated soil was added.', 
No puhA gene was detected in soil and sediment DNA extracts.', 
Moreover, some sediments exhibited high diuron mineralization potential even though puhB genes were not detected, suggesting the existence of alternative diuron degradation pathways.Microbial associations with corals are common and are most likely symbiotic, although their diversity and relationships with environmental factors and host species remain unclear.', 
The biotransformation rate constants were tested for statistical associations with various WWTP process parameters, amoA transcript abundance, and acetylene-inhibited monooxygenase activity.', 
We determined that (i) ammonia removal associates with oxidative micropollutant biotransformation reaction rates; (ii) archaeal but not bacterial amoA transcripts associate with both ammonia removal and oxidative micropollutant biotransformation reaction rates; and (iii) the activity of acetylene-inhibited monooxygenases (including ammonia monooxygenase) associates with ammonia removal and the biotransformation rate of isoproturon, but does not associate with all oxidative micropollutant biotransformations.', 
In combination, these results lead to the conclusion that ammonia removal and amoA transcript abundance can potentially be predictors of oxidative micropollutant biotransformation reactions, but that the biochemical mechanism is not necessarily linked to ammonia monooxygenase activity.Assessing in situ microbial abilities of soils to degrade pesticides is of great interest giving insight in soil filtering capability, which is a key ecosystem function limiting pollution of groundwater.', 
As a model, the activity of atrazine-degrading communities was monitored using RT-qPCRs to estimate the level of expression of atzD in five agricultural soils showing different atrazine mineralization abilities.', 
Interestingly, the relative abundance of atzD mRNA copy numbers was positively correlated to the maximum rate and to the maximal amount of atrazine mineralized.', 
Genes from the atrazine degrading pathway atzA/B/C/D/E/F, trzN, and trzD were monitored during the course of treatment and results demonstrated variation in atzC, trzD and trzN genes with time.', 
Change in copy number of trzN gene under different treatment processes was demonstrated by real-time PCR.', 
The amplified trzN gene was cloned and sequence data showed homology to genes reported in Arthrobacter and Nocardioides.', 
Partial assA genes (encoding the ceb1-subunit of alkylsuccinate synthase) were also detected, implying that the mechanism of fumarate addition may function in the hexadecane activation.Since their first introduction in the mid 1950s, man-made s-triazine herbicides such as atrazine have extensively been used in agriculture to control broadleaf weed growth in different crops, and thus contributed to improving crop yield and quality.', 
The hydrolase designated ChlH, responsible for the N-dealkylation of the side chain of butachlor, was purified 185.1-fold to homogeneity with 16.1% recovery.', 
The optimal pH and temperature of ChlH were observed to be 7.0-7.5 and 30 c2b0C, respectively.', 
Although the economics of the pharmaceutical industry continue to restrict investment in novel biomedical responses, action must be taken to avoid the conjunction of factors that promote evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance.To understand the role of abundance of tfdA gene classes belonging to ceb2- and ceb3-proteobacteria on phenoxy acid herbicide degradation, streambed sediments were sampled around three seepage meters (SMs) installed in a landfill-impacted groundwater-surface water interface.', 
SM1-sediment with the lowest abundance of tfdA gene classes had the slowest mineralization, whereas SM2- and SM3-sediments with more abundant tfdA genes had faster mineralization.', 
The observed difference in mineralization rates between discharge zones was simulated by a Monod-based kinetic model, which confirmed the role of abundance of tfdA gene classes.', 
We studied MCPA degradation at the soil-litter interface in a microcosm experiment and followed the succession of different degrader populations by quantifying the abundance of 16S rRNA genes as well as, the fungal ITS fragment and the functional genes tfdA (in total and divided into three classes) and cadA.', 
The increase of the tfdA class III and cadA genes was linked to MCPA mineralisation.', 
Total abundance of tfdA genes was dominated by class I MCPA degraders and did not reflect MCPA degradation potential of the soil.', 
An overview is given of the current, on-going evaluation of different reclamation technologies for irrigation.To assess the involvement of the genus Variovorax and the linuron hydrolase gene libA in in situ linuron degradation in agricultural fields, changes in Variovorax community size and composition, in libA abundance and in linuron mineralization capacity were monitored in field soil plots either treated or not with a linuron-containing herbicide mixture.', 
Changes in Variovorax community composition, due to the proliferation of a hereto unknown Variovorax phylotype D, and increases in libA numbers occurred concomitant to increases in linuron mineralization capacity in the plot treated with the herbicide mixture.', 
The observations suggest that Variovorax and libA proliferated as a response to linuron and hence their contribution to in situ linuron degradation.', 
The involvement of Variovorax phylotype D and libA in linuron degradation in the examined soil was supported by laboratory soil microcosm experiments.', 
strain WDL1, which mineralizes the phenylurea herbicide linuron, expresses a novel linuron-hydrolyzing enzyme, HylA, that converts linuron to 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA).', 
The enzyme is distinct from the linuron hydrolase LibA enzyme recently identified in other linuron-mineralizing Variovorax strains and from phenylurea-hydrolyzing enzymes (PuhA, PuhB) found in Gram-positive bacteria.', 
Within the metal-dependent amidohydrolase superfamily, HylA and PuhA/PuhB belong to two distinct protein families, while LibA is a member of the unrelated amidase signature family.', 
The involvement of hylA in linuron degradation by strain WDL1 is inferred from its absence in spontaneous WDL1 mutants defective in linuron hydrolysis and its presence in linuron-degrading Variovorax strains that lack libA.', 
SRS16, which contains libA.', 
A gene, cmeH, encoding an amidase that catalyzed the amide bond cleavage of CMEPA was cloned from strain DC-2.', 
The pdmAB genes in Sphingobium sp.', 
PdmAB is the oxygenase component of a bacterial Rieske non-heme iron oxygenase (RO) system.', 
The genes pdmAB, encoding the ceb1 subunit PdmA and the ceb2 subunit PdmB, are organized in a transposable element flanked by two direct repeats of an insertion element resembling ISRh1.', 
However, there was no evidence of a gene for an electron carrier (a ferredoxin or a reductase) located in the immediate vicinity of pdmAB.', 
PdmA exhibited low homology to the ceb1 subunits of previously characterized ROs (less than 37% identity) and did not cluster with the RO group involved in O- or N-demethylation reactions, indicating that PdmAB is a distinct bacterial RO N-demethylase.', 
The lip and mnp genes, which encode for peroxidase, and the carA gene, which encodes for laccase, were detected as the dominant genes for degradation of organic pollutants.', 
The hdt, hdg, and atzB genes, which encode for hydratase, dehalogenase, and ethylaminohydrolase, were found to be the most abundant genes involved in DDT, HCH, and ATZ degradation, respectively.', 
Cytochrome P450 genes were also more abundant under these primary substrate conditions.', 
Bioinformatic analysis of the Frankia genomes revealed that a potential gene cluster involved in atrazine decomposition contains three genes, namely, trzN (FRAAL1474 and FraEuI1c_5874), atzB (FRAAL1473 and FraEuI1c_5875), and atzR (FRAAL1471).', 
The LysR-type transcriptional regulator atzR (FRAAL1471), which is expected to control the cluster expression, showed a 13-fold increase in the expression level under atrazine stress.', 
Moreover, the putative adenosine aminohydrolase 3 atzB (FRAAL1473), which is expected to dealkylate the N-ethyl group of atrazine, showed also an increased expression by factor 16 with increased exposure.', 
Eventually, the trzN (FRAAL1474) gene, which is predicted to encode a putative amidohydrolase catalyzing atrazine dechlorination, exhibited 31-fold increased expression.', 
To our best knowledge, this is the first report about adenosine aminohydrolase 3 function in the dealkylation of the N-ethyl group from atrazine.', 
Genes from the atrazine degradation pathway, namely, atzA, atzB, atzD, trzN and trzD were quantified in all mesocosms for 60 days.', 
trzD was observed in the bioaugmented mesocosms only.', 
Primers were designed to amplify the conserved domain of tfdA, which is known to be involved in the degradation of 2,4-D.', 
Results showed that the tfdA genes of all 22 strains were most similar to that of Cupriavidus necator JMP134, which belongs to the 2,4-D/ceb1-ketoglutarate dioxygenase TfdA protein family, indicating that the JMP134-type tfdA gene is likely to be almost universal among the 2,4-D-degrading bacteria isolated from China.', 
In this study, we report a three-component Rieske non-heme iron oxygenase (RHO) system catalyzing the N-dealkylation of these herbicides.', 
The oxygenase component gene cndA is located in a transposable element that is highly conserved in the two strains.', 
CndA shares 24 to 42% amino acid sequence identities with the oxygenase components of some RHOs that catalyze N- or O-demethylation.', 
These genes were not located in the immediate vicinity of cndA.', 
The four ferredoxins share 64 to 72% amino acid sequence identities to the ferredoxin component of dicamba O-demethylase (DMO), and the two reductases share 62 to 65% amino acid sequence identities to the reductase component of DMO.', 
cndA, the four ferredoxin genes, and the two reductases genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins were purified using Ni-affinity chromatography.', 
The individual components or the components in pairs displayed no activity; the enzyme mixture showed N-dealkylase activities toward alachlor, acetochlor, and butachlor only when CndA-His6 was combined with one of the four ferredoxins and one of the two reductases, suggesting that the enzyme consists of three components, a homo-oligomer oxygenase, a  ferredoxin, and a GR-type reductase, and CndA has a low specificity for the electron transport component (ETC).', 
The N-dealkylase utilizes NADH, but not NADPH, as the electron donor.', 
Although tceA and vcrA gene copy numbers were relatively stable in DNA extracts over time, tceA and vcrA mRNA abundances were upregulated from undetectable levels to 2.96 c397 and 6.33 c397 10e281b4 transcripts/mL, respectively, only after exposure to TCE and lactate.', 
While tceA gene transcripts decreased over time with TCE dechlorination, the vcrA gene was expressed steadily even when the concentration of vinyl chloride was at undetectable levels.', 
In addition, ratios between catabolic and phylogenetic genes indicated that tceA and vcrA gene carrying organisms dechlorinated TCE and its produced daughter products, while vcrA gene was mainly responsible for the dechlorination of the lower VC concentrations in a later stage of degradation.On-farm biopurification systems (BPSs) treat pesticide-containing wastewater at farms by biodegradation and sorption processes.', 
Addition of acetylene, a specific methane monooxygenase (MMO) inhibitor, revealed that SMX and BTZ were mainly degraded co-metabolically by the present MOB.', 
One hundred and thirty-eight genes, including 14 dioxygenase genes, were predicted to be involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds, and most of these genes are clustered in four regions.', 
P73_0346 is the first fluoranthene 7,8-dioxygenase to be discovered and the first fluoranthene dioxygenase within the toluene/biphenyl family.', 
This is the first report of a 2,4-D-degrader containing tfdA gene that can utilize these two herbicides.', 
BbdA shows low amino acid sequence identity with reported amidases and is encoded by an IncP1-ceb2 plasmid (pBAM1, 40.6 kb) that lacks several genes for conjugation.', 
BbdA has a remarkably low KM for BAM (0.71 cebcM) and also shows activity against benzamide and ortho-chlorobenzamide (OBAM).', 
strains, bbdA and pBAM1 appear to be involved in BAM degradation.', 
PCR detection of genotypes involved in bacterial phenol degradation revealed that the degradation pathways contained the initial oxidative attack by phenol hydroxylase, and subsequent ring fission by catechol 1,2-dioxygenase.', 
Detection of the benzene carboxylase encoding gene, abcA, and benzoic acid in the culture vessel indicated that benzene degradation proceeds through an initial carboxylation step.<i>Aminobacter</i> sp.', 
The BAM-catabolic genes in MSH1 are located on plasmid pBAM1, carrying <i>bbdA</i>, which encodes the conversion of BAM to 2,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (2,6-DCBA) (BbdA<sup>+</sup> phenotype), and plasmid pBAM2, carrying gene clusters encoding the conversion of 2,6-DCBA to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (Dcba<sup>+</sup> phenotype).', 
A higher incidence of BbdA<sup>+</sup> Dcba<sup>-</sup> MSH1 cells was also observed when MSH1 was grown as a biofilm in flow chambers under C and N starvation conditions due to growth on nonselective residual assimilable organic carbon.', 
Nearly two hundred extradiol dioxygenase encoding genes of three different superfamilies could be identified.', 
The isophthalate-induced proteins include a phenylacetate:CoA ligase, a UbiD-like decarboxylase, a UbiX-like flavin prenyltransferase, and a hypothetical protein.', 
In vitro enzyme assays with cell-free extracts of isophthalate-grown cells indicated that isophthalate is activated to isophthalyl-CoA by an ATP-dependent isophthalate:CoA ligase (IPCL), and subsequently decarboxylated to benzoyl-CoA by a UbiD family isophthalyl-CoA decarboxylase (IPCD) that requires a prenylated flavin mononucleotide (prFMN) cofactor supplied by UbiX to effect decarboxylation.', 
The qPCR results show an increase in microbial biomass and functional genes (tfdA) in liquid phase after DOM addition.', 
Growth dependent constitutive requirements for Ni-dependent urease or perhaps Ni-dependent superoxide dismutase enzymes (found in Rhodococcus genomes) provided a mechanistic explanation for stimulation.', 
The expression of atrazine chlorohydrolase gene trzN in the strain DNS10 cultured with 0.05e280afmM and 1.0e280afmM Zn<sup>2+</sup> was 7.30- and 4.67- times respectively compared with that of the non-zinc treatment.', 
Microplastic amendment (2000 fragments per kg soil) significantly increased the urease and catalase activities in soil after 15 days, and no discernible alteration of invertase activities was detected.', 
In the 2nd week, the maximum copy numbers of the masD and bamA genes in the treatments with biochar were 349 copies/mL (20c2a0mg/L) and 422 copies/mL (20c2a0mg/L), respectively, and in the treatments with graphene oxide were 289 copies/mL (0c2a0mg/L) and 366 copies/mL (0.02c2a0mg/L).', 
Application of specific-genus primers targeting Dehalococcoides mccartyi species and the vinyl chloride-to-ethene reductive dehalogenase vcrA indicated the presence of autochthonous bacteria capable of the complete dechlorination of PCE.', 
The rigid-flexible molecular docking method revealed that the mutated naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase had lower affinity for naphthalene than that found in wild type strain.', 
Altogether, our results support the use of these bacteria in the treatment of industrial wastewaters containing azo dyes.We report a cluster of genes encoding two monooxygenases (SadA and SadB) and one FMN reductase (SadC) that enable Microbacterium sp.', 
Our results show that SadA and SadC are responsible for the initial attack of sulfonamide molecules resulting in the release of 4-aminophenol.', 
The latter is further transformed into 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene by SadB and SadC prior to mineralization and concomitant production of biomass.', 
As the degradation products lack antibiotic activity, the presence of SadA will result in an alleviated bacteriostatic effect of sulfonamides.', 
Together, these data provide supporting evidence that SS1 and SS2 might be good candidates for restoring biphenyl/PCB-polluted environments.Expression of the bacterial nitroreductase gene, nfsI, in tobacco plastids conferred the ability to detoxify TNT.', 
Previous studies have demonstrated that plants transformed with the bacterial nitroreductase gene, nfsI have increased ability to tolerate and detoxify TNT.', 
It has been proposed that plants engineered to express nfsI could be used to remediate TNT on military ranges, but this could require steps to mitigate transgene flow to wild populations.', 
To address this, we have developed nfsI transplastomic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) to reduce pollen-borne transgene flow.', 
Here we have shown that when grown on solid or liquid media, the transplastomic tobacco expressing nfsI were significantly more tolerant to TNT, produced increased biomass and removed more TNT from the media than untransformed plants.', 
Additionally, transplastomic plants expressing nfsI regenerated with high efficiency when grown on medium containing TNT, suggesting that nfsI and TNT could together be used to provide a selectable screen for plastid transformation.Lignolytic fungi initiate lignocellulose decay by producing extracellular oxidative enzymes.', 
For better understanding the enzymatic degradation of lignocellulose by white-rot fungi, we investigated the effect of manganese on the organic matter loss, manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity, and manganese peroxidase gene (mnp) transcription levels during solid-state fermentation of rice straw with Phanerochaete chrysosporium.', 
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed the differential expression of mnp1, mnp2, and mnp3: manganese amendment increased the transcription of mnp1 and mnp2 but not mnp3.', 
The results indicated that manganese stimulated mnp transcription levels and played a post-transcriptional role in MnP production.', 
Moreover, Tween80 probably increased GY2B vitality and growth by inducing the expression of peptidylprolyl isomerase to stabilize cell membrane, increasing the abundances of proteins involved in intracellular metabolic pathways (e.g.', 
Optimum protease production of 433U/ml was achieved and the purified enzyme was identified as acidic metalloprotease, a monomeric protein.', 
We identified a novel arsenic methyltransferase (WaarsM) gene from a soil fungus, Westerdykella aurantiaca.', 
WaarsM showed sequence homology with all known arsenic methyltransferases having three conserved SAM binding motifs.', 
The expression of WaarsM enhanced arsenic resistance in E. coli (ce94ars) and S. cerevisiae (ce94acr2) strains by biomethylation and required endogenous reductants, preferably GSH, for methyltransferase activity.', 
The purified WaarsM catalyzes the production of methylated arsenicals from both AsIII and AsV, and also displays AsV reductase activity.', 
S. cerevisiae (ce94acr2) cells expressing WaarsM produced 2.2 ppm volatile arsenic and 0.64 ppm DMA(v) with 0.58 ppm volatile arsenicals when exposed to 20 ppm AsV and 2 ppm AsIII, respectively.', 
Thus, characterization of WaarsM provides a potential strategy to reduce arsenic concentration in soil with reduced arsenic accumulation in crops grown in arsenic contaminated areas, and thereby alleviating human health risks.A rhizobial strain, Sinorhizobium meliloti NM, could use 3,3\\',4,4\\'-tetrachloro-biphenyl (PCB 77) as the sole carbon and energy source for growth in mineral salt medium.", 
It was also observed that several degradative enzymes catechol 1,2 dioxygenase, catechol 2,3 dioxygenase, protocatechuate 2,3 dioxygenase, protocatechuate 3,4 dioxygenase, protocatechuate 4,5 dioxygenase, salicylate hydroxylase and 2-carboxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase were differentially induced at different stages of fluoranthene degradation.', 
In additionto cross-coupling with acetaminophen, NOM moieties could couple to each other upon reaction with laccase.', 
The purified enzyme was optimally active at 65 degrees C and pH 6.0 and showed a mild but significant synergistic effect in combination with other xylanolytic enzymes, including xylanase, beta-xylosidase and acetyl esterase, on the degradation of oat-spelt xylan, corn cob and corn husk substrates with a 1.25, 1.32 and 1.21-fold increase in the amount of reducing sugar released, respectively, compared to the expected (additive) amounts for the individual enzymes acting alone.', 
Sequential reactions using two xylan-backbone degrading enzymes (xylanase/beta-xylosidase) and two debranching enzymes (alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase/acetyl esterase) were also determined.', 
MnP (Manganese dependent peroxidase) and laccase activities showed the greatest increases in the samples containing Aroclors, indicating that extracellular enzymes of Ceriporia sp.', 
Cytochrome P450 monooxygenase was inhibited and the biodegradation rate of the Aroclor decreased by adding the inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole.', 
After a first oxidation step leading to catechol in mesophilic and thermophilic microorganisms, two main routes have been identified depending on the cleavage of the aromatic ring: ortho involving a catechol 1,2 dioxygenase (C12D) and meta involving a catechol 2,3 dioxygenase (C23D).',
