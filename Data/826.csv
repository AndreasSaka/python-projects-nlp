0,Acinetobacter NCIB 9871 was isolated by elective culture on cyclohexanol and grows with this compound as sole source of carbon.
1,"It displays a restricted growth spectrum, being unable to grow on a wide range of alternative alicyclic alcohols and ketones."
2,Cyclohexanol-grown cells oxidize the growth substrate at a rate of 230 mul of O2/h per mg dry wt with the consumption of 5.65 mumol of O2/mumol substrate.
3,Cyclohexanone is oxidized at a similar rate with the consumption of 4.85 mumol of O2/mumol.
4,1-Oxa-2-oxocycloheptane and 6-hydroxyhexanoate are both oxidized at the same slow rate of 44 mul of O2/h per mg dry wt and adipate is not oxidized.
5,"Studies with cell extracts reveal the presence of inducible dehydrogenases for cyclohexanol, 6-hydroxyhexanoate and 6-oxohexanoate and a monooxygenase, that in conjunction with a lactonase converts cyclohexanone to 6-hydroxyhexanoate."
6,"The monooxygenase is therefore presumed to be of the lactone-forming type and the pathway for conversion of cyclohexanol to adipate; cyclohexanol leads to cyclohexanone leads to 1-oxa-2-oxocycloheptane leads to 6-hydroxyhexanoate leads to 6-oxohexanoate leads to adipate; for which key intermediates have been identified chromatographically, is identical with the route for the oxidation of cyclohexanol by Nocardia globerula CL1.A mixed bacterial culture, consisting of a minimum of nine isolates, was adapted to growth on technical parathion (PAR) as a sole carbon and energy source."
7,The primary oxidative pathway for PAR metabolism involved an initial hydrolysis to yield diethylthiophosphoric acid and p-nitrophenol.
8,A secondary oxidative pathway involved the oxidation of PAR to paraoxon and then hydrolysis to yield p-nitrophenol and diethylphosphoric acid.
9,Under low oxgen conditions PAR was reduced via a third pathway to p-aminoparathion and subsequently hydrolyzed to p-aminophenol and diethylthiophosphoric acid.
10,"PAR hydrolase, an enzyme produced by an isolate from the mixed culture, rapidly hydrolyzed PAR and paraoxon (6.0 mumol/mg per min)."
11,This enzyme was inducible and stable at room temperature and retained 100% of its activity when heated for 55 C for 10 min.Cyclohexylamine oxidase was purified 90-fold from cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas sp.
12,capable of assimilating sodium cyclamate.
13,"The purified enzyme was homogeneous in disc electrophoresis, and the molecular weight was found to be approximately 80,000 by gel filtration."
14,The enzyme catalyzed the following reaction: cyclohexylamine+O2+H2O leads to cyclohexanone+NH3+H2O2.
15,The enzyme thus can be classified as an amine oxidase; it utilized oxygen as the ultimate electron acceptor.
16,"The pH optimum of the reaction was 6.8 and the apparent Km value for cyclohexylamine was 2.5 X 10(-4) M. The enzyme was highly specific for the deamination of alicyclic primary amines such as cyclohexylamine, but was found to be inactive toward ordinary amines used as substrates for amine oxidases."
17,The enzyme solution was yellow in color and showed a typical flavoprotein spectrum; the addition of cyclohexylamine under anaerobic conditions caused reduction of the flavin in the native enzyme.
18,The flavin of the prosthetic group was identified as FAD by thin layer chromatography.
19,"The participation of sulfhydryl groups in the enzymic action was also suggested by the observation that the enzyme activity was inhibited in the presence of PCMB and could be recovered by the addition of glutathione.Phthalate is degraded through 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate and protocatechuate in Pseudomonas testosteroni NH1000."
20,"The ezyme 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylase, catalyzing the conversion of 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate to protocatechuate and carbon dioxide, was purified approximately 130-fold from phthalate-induced cells of a protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase-deficient mutant of P. testosteroni."
21,"The most purified preparation showed a single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide disc gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of 38,000."
22,"The apparent molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by Sephadex G-200 column chromatography was 150,000."
23,"Among the substrate analogs tested, only 4-hydroxyphthalate served as a substrate, which was decarboxylated to form m-hydroxybenzoate."
24,"The apparent Km values for 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate and 4-hydroxyphthalate were estimated to be 10.5 micrometer and 1.25 mM, respectively, and the Vmax for the former was 10 times larger than that for the latter."
25,"Whereas the wild-type strain could utilize 4-hydroxyphthalate as a sole source of carbon, none of the following could grow with the compound: 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylase-deficient, m-hydroxybenzoate-nondegradable, and protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase-deficient mutants."
26,"Since one-step revertants of these mutants could utilize 4-hydroxyphthalate, the compound appears to be metabolized through m-hydroxybenzoate and protocatechuate in P. testosteroni NH1000.A strain of Pseudomonas putida that can utilize naphthalene as its sole source of carbon and energy was isolated from soil."
27,"A mutant strain of this organism, P. putida 119, when grown on glucose in the presence of naphthalene, accumulates optically pure (+)-cis-1(R),2(S)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene in the culture medium."
28,The cis relative stereochemistry in this molecule was established by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry.
29,"Radiochemical trapping experiments established that this cis dihydrodiol is an intermediate in the metabolism of naphthalene by P. Fluorescens (formerly ATCC, 17483), P. putida (ATCC, 17484), and a Pseudomonas species (NCIB 9816), as well as the parent strain of P. putida described in this report."
30,Formation of the cis dihydrodiol is catalyzed by a dioxygenase which requires either NADH or NADPH as an electron donor.
31,A double label procedure is described for determining the origin of oxygen in the cis dihydrodiol under conditions where this metabolite would not normally accumulate.
32,Several aromatic hydrocarbons are oxidized by cell extracts prepared from naphthalene-grown cells of P. putida.
33,"The cis dihydrodiol is converted to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene by an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase."
34,This enzyme is specific for the (+) isomer of the dihydrodiol and shows a primary isotope effect when the dihydrodiol is substituted at C-2 with deuterium.The mutagenicity of 17 aliphatic epoxides was determined using the specially constructed mutants of Salmonella typhimurium developed by Ames.
35,The activity of these epoxides together with those reported in the literature as mutagens in strains TA100 and TA1535 depended on the degree of substitution around the oxirane ring.
36,Monosubstituted oxiranes were the most potent mutagens in both strains.
37,"1,1-Disubstitution resulted in the complete loss or reduction of mutagenicity, trans-1,2-Disubstituted, and tetrasubstituted oxiranes all lacked mutagenicity, while the cis-1,2-disubstituted oxiranes tested were weakly mutagenic in strain TA100 only."
38,For the monosubstituted compounds the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents increased mutagenicity.Pseudomonas sp.
39,N.C.I.B.
40,"9816 strain 11, when grown on salicylate in the presence of dibenzodioxan, accumulated cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrodibenzodioxan and 2-hydroxydibenzodioxan in the culture medium."
41,Each metabolite was isolated in crystalline form and identified by a variety of conventional chemical techniques.
42,"Crude cell extracts prepared from the parental strain grown with naphthalene oxidized cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrodibenzodioxan under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions to 1,2-dihydroxydibenzodioxan."
43,"Further degradation of this metabolite was not detected.An analytical procedure for the separation, detection, and identification of some of the compounds produced by a cell preparation of the fungus Candida humicola from 74As-arsenate, -methylarsonate, and -dimethylarsinate has been devised and tested."
44,"It has been possible to detect five distinct 74As-containing compounds following the incubation of 74As-arsenate with a broken cell homogenate, three of which have been identified as arsenite, methylarsonate, and dimethylarsinate."
45,"With methylarsonate as substrate, dimethylarsinate and trimethylarsine oxide are produced."
46,Products from dimethylarsinate include methylarsonate and trimethylarsine oxide as well as an unknown species.
47,The absence of any transformation when buffer replaces the cell preparation implicates these various compounds as intermediates in a biological synthesis of trimethylarsine.A variety of octane-utilizing bacteria and fungi were screened for growth on some terminally branched dimethyloctane derivatives to explore the effects of iso- and anteiso-termini on the biodegradability of such hydrocarbons.
48,"Of 27 microbial strains tested, only 9 were found to use any of the branched hydrocarbons tested as a sole carbon source, and then only those hydrocarbons containing at least one iso-terminus were susceptible to degradation."
49,Anteiso-or isopropenyl termini prevented biodegradation.
50,None of the hydrocarbonoclastic yeasts tested was able to utilize branched-hydrocarbon growth sustrates.
51,"In the case of pseudomonads containing the OCT plasmid, whole-cell oxidation of n-octane was poorly induced by terminally branched dimethyloctanes."
52,"In the presence of a gratuitous inducer of the octane-oxidizing enzymes, the iso-branched 2,7-dimethyloctane was slowly oxidized by whole cells, whereas the anteiso-branched 3,6-dimethyloctane was not oxidized at all."
53,"This microbial sampling dramatically illustrated the deleterious effect of alkyl branching, especially anteiso-terminal branching, on the biodegradation of hydrocarbons.With different soil and water samples as inoculum and the benzimidazole fungicides benomyl (either as Benlate or as the pure compound) and thiabendazole as selective agents, a large number of, mainly fluorescent, Pseudomonas strains were isolated which nearly all were able to grow in a mineral medium with benomyl as the sole source of carbon."
54,"However, no growth occurred with any of a series of other benzimidazole compounds, viz."
55,"benzimidazole, 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-AB), thiabendazole and fuberidazole."
56,"Although benomyl--or rather its non-enzymatic breakdown product methyl benzimidazol-2-yl carbamate (MBC)--was partially degraded to 2-AB, most probably n-butylamine, which arises after splitting off of the butylcarbamoyl side chain, was the actual carbon source for the Pseudomonas isolates."
57,"When incorporated in a lactate medium, 2-AB markedly inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas spp."
58,"at a concentration of 250 microgram/ml, with complete inhibition being attained at 500 microgram/ml."
59,For Bacillus spp.
60,"grown in liquid peptone media benzimidazole compounds were inhibitory at concentrations of 500-1000 microgram/ml, with a toxicity increasing in the order: benzimidazole less than thiabendazole less than MBC less than 2-AB.The ability of various pseudomonads to utilize acyclic isoprenoids as a sole carbon source was investigated."
61,"Tests for utilization of acyclic isoprenols such as citronellol and geraniol were complicated by toxic effects of these alcohols, and most species tested were killed by exposure to citronellol or geraniol (0.1%, vol/vol) in liquid culture."
62,"In the case of Pseudomonas citronellolis, sensitivity to isoprenols is reduced by prior induction of the isoprenoid degradative pathway via either growth on succinate in the presence of citronellol or growth on citronellic acid."
63,"For this species, citronellic acid proved to be the best isoprenoid growth substrate tested."
64,Geraniol utilization as a taxonomic indicator for different subgroups of pseudomonads is discussed.
65,Only a few of the species tested were able to utilize acyclic isoprenoids.
66,"Two species which utilize C10 acyclic isoprenoids, P. aeruginosa and P. mendocina, were shown to contain the inducible enzyme geranyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, one of the unique enzymes in the isoprenol degradative pathway known to occur in P. citronellolis."
67,"Of the species which utilized geranitol, none showed definite growth on the homologous C15 and C20 isoprenols.A ketone monooxygenase was purified from cells of Pseudomonas cepacia grown on 2-tridecanone as sole carbon source."
68,"Enzyme stability is maintained by the addition of ethanol, EDTA, and dithiothreitol."
69,"Stoichiometric studies show that for 1 mol of undecyl acetate formed, 1 mol of O2 is consumed and 1 mol of NADPH is oxidized."
70,"The monooxygenase, purified to homogeneity, has a molecular weight of approximately 123,000 and consists of two equal subunits with molecular weights of 55,000."
71,The enzyme contains FAD and exhibits absorption maxima at 375 and 488 nm.
72,"Enzyme activity is inhibited by thiol-active reagents and the inhibition by the cations, cadmium, copper, zinc, and mercury, is reversed by dithiothreitol, indicating the presence of essential sulfhydryl groups."
73,Substrate specificity tests show that acetate esters are formed from methyl ketones from C-7 through C-14.
74,The oxygenase is also active on isomers of 2-tridecanone forming esters from 3- through 7-tridecanone.
75,"With 6-tridecanone, two esters are formed, heptyl hexanoate and pentyl octanoate, indicating that oxygen is inserted on either side of the carbonyl group."
76,"In addition, the enzyme catalyzes the lactonization of the cyclic ketone, cyclopentanone, with the formation of 5-valerolactone.A comparison of the oxidation rates of various compounds by whole cells of Pseudomonas putida 3, 5 indicated that m-cresol is metabolized by oxidation to 3-hydroxybenzoate followed by hydroxylation to gentisate, the ring-fission substrate, when grown with 3, 5-xylenol."
77,"However, when m-cresol was the growth substrate, similar experiments suggested a different pathway involving a methyl-substituted catechol, and ring-fission by meta cleavage."
78,Assays of ring-fission enzymes in cell-free extracts confirmed that different pathways are induced by the two growth substrates.
79,"3, 5-Xylenol-grown cells contained high levels of gentisate oxygenase and only very small amounts of catechol oxygenase, whereas gentisate ocygenase could not be detected in m-cresol-grown cells, but levels of catechol oxygenase were greatly increased."
80,"Extracts of m-cresol-grown cells also contained 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase and hydrolase, whose specificities enable them to metabolize the ring-fission products from catechol, 3-methylcatechol, and 4-methylcatechol."
81,This catechol pathway is also used by m-cresol-grown cells for p-cresol metabolism.
82,"In contrast, the results for cells grown with p-cresol point to an alternative pathway involving oxidation to 4-hydroxybenzoate and hydrosylation to protocatechuate as ring-fission substrate."
83,"Extracts of these cells contained high levels of protocatechuate oxygenase and only small amounts of catechol oxygenase.In studying the transformation of diazepam (7-chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one) by fungi isolated from soil."
84,N1-demethylation and cleavage of the diazepine ring were observed.
85,"Three metabolites: 7-chloro-5-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one, 2-acetamido-2""-benzoyl-4""-chloroacetanilide and 2-acetamido-2""-benzoyl-4""-chloro-N-methylacetanilide were isolated and identified.None of the monofluorobenzoates serves as sole source of carbon and energy for growth of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus but all can contribute to growth on other substrates."
86,The monofluorobenzoates are oxidised by bacteria pre-induced for benzoate oxidation and can themselves induce the appropriate enzymes.
87,The initial products of oxidation have been separated and identified by gas-liquid chromatography.
88,"2-Flurobenzoate is oxidised to catechol, fluoride and 3-fluorocatechol; 3-fluorobenzoate gives 3- and 4-fluorocatechol; 4-fluorobenzoate gives 4-fluorocatechol."
89,"The fluorocatechols appear to be partially oxidised beyond the stage of 3-oxoadipate by suitably pre-induced bacteria.Enrichment cultures yielded two strains of Pseudomonas putida capable of growth with orcinol (3,5-dihydroxytoluene) as the sole source of carbon."
90,"Experiments with cell suspensions and cell extracts indicate that orcinol is metabolized by hydroxylation of the benzene ring followed successively by ring cleavage and hydrolyses to give 2 mol of acetate and 1 mol of pyruvate per mol of orcinol as shown: orcinol leads to 2,3,5-trihydroxytoluene leads to 2,4,6-trioxoheptanoate leads to acetate + acetylpyruvate leads to acetate + pyruvate."
91,"Evidence for this pathway is based on: (i) high respiratory activities of orcinol-grown cells towards 2,3,5-trihydroxytoluene; (ii) transient accumulation of a quinone, probably 2-hydroxy-6-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone, during grouth with orcinol; (iii) formation of pyruvate and acetate from orcinol, 2,3,5-trihydroxytoluene, and acetylpyruvate catalyzed by extracts of orcinol, but not by succinate-grown cells; (iv) characterization of the product of oxidation of 3-methylcatechol (an analogue of 2,3,5-trihydroxytoluene) showing that oxygenative cleavage occurs between carbons bearing methyl and hydroxyl substituents; (v) transient appearance of a compound having spectral properties similar to those of acetylpyruvate during 2,3,5-trihydroxytoluene oxidation by extracts of orcinol-grown cells."
92,"Orcinol hydroxylase exhibits catalytic activity when resorcinol or m-cresol is substituted for orcinol; hydroxyquinol and 3-methylcatechol are substrates for the ring cleavage enzyme 2,3,5-trihydroxytoluene-1,2-oxygenase."
93,The enzymes of this pathway are induced by growth with orcinol but not with glucose or succinate.1.
94,The isolation of trimethylamine dehydrogenase (EC 1.5.99.7) from a restricted facultative methylotroph to electrophoretic homogeneity is described.
95,2
96,The molecular weight and subunit molecular weights were found to be 146800 for the enzyme by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation and 70000-80000 for the two non-identical subunits by sodium dodecyl sulphate gel electrophoresis.
97,3
98,Initial velocity studies indicate that the enzymatic reaction proceeds by a Ping-Pong mechanism.
99,4
100,"Further kinetic evidence was obtained by analysis of product inhibition patterns using the alternate substrate diethylamine and the products acetaldehyde and ethylamine as product inhibitors, for the release of ethylamine before the addition of phenazine methosulphate and for the existence of an enzyme-two-carbon unit complex as a stable form of the enzyme."
101,5
102,Some properties of the unusual prosthetic group of trimethylamine dehydrogenase and its photodegradation product are described in preliminary form.The xylene monooxygenase system encoded by the TOL plasmid pWW0 of Pseudomonas putida catalyses the hydroxylation of a methyl side-chain of toluene and xylenes.
103,"Genetic studies have suggested that this monooxygenase consists of two different proteins, products of the xylA and xylM genes, which function as an electron-transfer protein and a terminal hydroxylase, respectively."
104,"In this study, the electron-transfer component of xylene monooxygenase, the product of xylA, was purified to homogeneity."
105,Fractions containing the xylA gene product were identified by its NADH:cytochrome c reductase activity.
106,"The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined to be 40 kDa by SDS/PAGE, and 42 kDa by gel filtration."
107,"The enzyme was found to contain 1 mol/mol of tightly but not covalently bound FAD, as well as 2 mol/mol of non-haem iron and 2 mol/mol of acid-labile sulfide, suggesting the presence of two redox centers, one FAD and one  cluster/protein molecule."
108,"The oxidised form of the protein had absorbance maxima at 457 nm and 390 nm, with shoulders at 350 nm and 550 nm."
109,These absorbance maxima disappeared upon reduction of the protein by NADH or dithionite.
110,"The NADH:acceptor reductase was capable of reducing either one- or two-electron acceptors, such as horse heart cytochrome c or 2,6-dichloroindophenol, at an optimal pH of 8.5."
111,The reductase was found to have a Km value for NADH of 22 microM.
112,The oxidation of NADH was determined to be stereospecific; the enzyme is pro-R (class A enzyme).
113,The titration of the reductase with NADH or dithionite yielded three distinct reduced forms of the enzyme: the reduction of the  center occurred with a midpoint redox potential of -171 mV; and the reduction of FAD to FAD.
114,"(semiquinone form), with a calculated midpoint redox potential of -244 mV."
115,The reduction of FAD.
116,"to FAD.. (dihydroquinone form), the last stage of the titration, occurred with a midpoint redox potential of -297 mV."
117,The  center could be removed from the protein by treatment with an excess of mersalyl acid.
118,"The -depleted protein was still reduced by NADH, giving rise to the formation of the anionic flavin semiquinone observed in the native enzyme, thus suggesting that the electron flow was NADH --> FAD -->  in this reductase."
119,"The resulting protein could no longer reduce cytochrome c, but could reduce 2,6-dichloroindophenol at a reduced rate.By enrichment and isolation techniques bacterial strains with the capacity to grow on aliphatic cyclic ethers (dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxolane) have been isolated."
120,Six strains that degrade tetrahydrofuran were classified as belonging to the genus Rhodococcus.
121,One of two strains that degrade dioxane instead of or in combination with tetrahydrofuran was further characterized and a hypothetical catabolic pathway comprising an initial 2-hydroxylation and several oxidation steps is postulated.A coryneform bacterium that is able to utilize cis- and trans-3-chloroacrylic acid as sole carbon source for growth was isolated from freshwater sediment.
122,"The organism was found to produce two inducible dehalogenases, one specific for the cis- and the other for trans-3-chloroacrylic acid."
123,Both dehalogenases were purified to homogeneity from cells induced for dehalogenase synthesis with 3-chlorocrotonic acid.
124,The enzymes produced muconic acid semialdehyde (3-oxopropionic acid) from their respective 3-chloroacrylic acid substrate.
125,No other substrates were found.
126,The cis-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase consisted of two polypeptide chains of a molecular weight 16.2 kDa.
127,Trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase was a protein with subunits of 7.4 and 8.7 kDa.
128,"The subunit and amino acid compositions and the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the enzymes indicate that they are not closely related.We report the isolation of Pseudomonas cepacia MB2, believed to be the first microorganism to utilize 2-methylbenzoic acid as the sole carbon source."
129,"Its growth range included all mono- and dimethylbenzoates (with the exception of 2,5- and 2,6-dimethylbenzoates) and 3-chloro-2-methylbenzoate (but not 4- or 5-chloro-2-methylbenzoate) but not chlorobenzoates lacking a methyl group."
130,"2-Chlorobenzoate, 3-chlorobenzoate, and 2,3-, 2,4-, and 3,4-dichlorobenzoates inhibited growth of MB2 on 2-methylbenzoate as a result of cometabolism to the corresponding chlorinated catechols which blocked the key enzyme catechol 2,3-dioxygenase."
131,"A metapyrocatechase-negative mutant, MB2-G5, showed accumulation of dimethylcatechols from 2,3- and 3,4-dimethylbenzoates, and phenols were detected in resting-cell transformation extracts bearing the same substitution pattern as the original substrate, presumably following thermal degradation of the intermediate dihydrodiol."
132,2-Methylphenol was also found in extracts of the mutant cells with 2-methylbenzoate.
133,These observations suggested a major route of methylbenzoate metabolism to be dioxygenation to a carboxy-hydrodiol which then forms a catechol derivative.
134,"In addition, the methyl group of 2-methylbenzoate was oxidized to isobenzofuranone (by cells of MB2-G5) and to phthalate (by cells of a separate mutant that could not utilize phthalate, MB2-D2)."
135,"This pathway also generated a chlorinated isobenzofuranone from 3-chloro-2-methylbenzoate.Peptides obtained by cleavage of a Rhodococcus rhodochrous K22 nitrilase, which acts on aliphatic nitriles such as acrylonitrile, crotonitrile, and glutaronitrile, have been sequenced."
136,The data allowed the design of oligonucleotide probes which were used to clone a nitrilase encoding gene.
137,"Plasmid pNK21, in which 2.05-kb sequence covering the region encoding the nitrilase was was placed under the control of the lac promoter, directed overproduction of enzymatically active nitrilase in response to addition of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside in Escherichia coli."
138,"Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the cell extract showed that the amount of nitrilase was about 40% of the total soluble proteins, leading to the establishment of a simple purification of the nitrilase."
139,"The nucleotide sequence of the nitrilase gene predicts a protein composed of 383 amino acids (M(r) = 42,275), including only one cysteine."
140,"The amino acid sequence homology between the Rhodococcus nitrilase and the Klebsiella ozaenae bromoxynil nitrilase  was 38.3%, and a unique cysteinyl residue (Cys-170) in the former nitrilase was conserved at the corresponding position in the latter nitrilase."
141,Cys-170 of the Rhodococcus nitrilase was replaced by Ala or Ser by site-directed mutagenesis.
142,"Both mutations resulted in the complete loss of nitrilase activity, clearly indicating that this cysteinyl residue is essential for the catalytic activity.Superoxide dismutase and Fe3+EDTA catalyzed the nitration by peroxynitrite (ONOO-) of a wide range of phenolics including tyrosine in proteins."
143,Nitration was not mediated by a free radical mechanism because hydroxyl radical scavengers did not reduce either superoxide dismutase or Fe3+EDTA-catalyzed nitration and nitrogen dioxide was not a significant product from either catalyst.
144,"Rather, metal ions appear to catalyze the heterolytic cleavage of peroxynitrite to form a nitronium-like species (NO2+)."
145,The calculated energy for separating peroxynitrous acid into hydroxide ion and nitronium ion is 13 kcal.mol-1 at pH 7.0.
146,Fe3+EDTA catalyzed nitration with an activation energy of 12 kcal.mol-1 at a rate of 5700 M-1.s-1 at 37 degrees C and pH 7.5.
147,"The reaction rate of peroxynitrite with bovine Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase was 10(5) M-1.s-1 at low superoxide dismutase concentrations, but the rate of nitration became independent of superoxide dismutase concentration above 10 microM with only 9% of added peroxynitrite yielding nitrophenol."
148,"We propose that peroxynitrite anion is more stable in the cis conformation, whereas only a higher energy species in the trans conformation can fit in the active site of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase."
149,"At high superoxide dismutase concentrations, phenolic nitration may be limited by the rate of isomerization from the cis to trans conformations of peroxynitrite as well as by competing pathways for peroxynitrite decomposition."
150,"In contrast, Fe3+EDTA appears to react directly with the cis anion, resulting in greater nitration yields.A cDNA clone encoding phenol hydroxylase from the soil yeast Trichosporon cutaneum was isolated and characterized."
151,The clone was identified by hybridization screening of a bacteriophage lambda ZAP-based cDNA library with an oligonucleotide probe which corresponded to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme.
152,The cDNA encodes a protein consisting of 664 amino acids.
153,Amino acid sequences of a number of peptides obtained by Edman degradation of various cleavage products of the purified enzyme were identified in the cDNA-derived sequence.
154,The phenol hydroxylase cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli to yield high levels of active enzyme.
155,"The E. coli-derived phenol hydroxylase is very similar to the T. cutaneum enzyme with respect to the range of substrates acted upon, inhibition by excess phenol, and the order of magnitude of kinetic parameters in the overall reaction."
156,"Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of phenol hydroxylase gene-related sequences in a number of T. cutaneum and Trichosporon beigelii strains and in Cryptococcus elinovii but not in Trichosporon pullulans, Trichosporon penicillatum, or Candida tropicalis.Oxidation of benzocyclobutene by intact cells of Pseudomonas fluorescens 127-68 XVII, containing naphthalene dioxygenase, yielded exclusively benzylic oxidation products; benzocyclobutene-1-ol and benzocyclobutene-1-one."
157,No evidence for incorporation of oxygen into the aromatic ring was found.The bacterium Sphingomonas sp.
158,"strain SS3, which utilizes diphenyl ether and its 4-fluoro, 4-chloro, and (to a considerably lesser extent) 4-bromo derivatives as sole sources of carbon and energy, was enriched from soil samples of an industrial waste deposit."
159,The bacterium showed cometabolic activities toward all other isomeric monohalogenated diphenyl ethers.
160,"During diphenyl ether degradation in batch culture experiments, phenol and catechol were produced as intermediates which were then channeled into the 3-oxoadipate pathway."
161,"The initial step in the degradation follows the recently discovered mechanism of 1,2-dioxygenation, which yields unstable phenolic hemiacetals from diphenyl ether structures."
162,"Oxidation of the structure-related dibenzo-p-dioxin yielded 2-(2-hydroxyphenoxy)-muconate upon ortho cleavage of the intermediate 2,2\',3-trihydroxydiphenyl ether."
163,"Formation of phenol, catechol, halophenol, and halocatechol from the conversion of monohalogenated diphenyl ethers gives evidence for a nonspecific attack of the dioxygenating enzyme system.Two Rhodococcus erythropolis strains, HL 24-1 and HL 24-2, were isolated from soil and river water by their abilities to utilize 2,4-dinitrophenol (0.5 mM) as the sole source of nitrogen."
164,"Although succinate was supplied as a carbon and energy source during selection, both isolates could utilize 2,4-dinitrophenol also as the sole source of carbon."
165,"Both strains metabolized 2,4-dinitrophenol under concomitant liberation of stoichiometric amounts of nitrite and 4,6-dinitrohexanoate as a minor dead-end metabolite.Rhodococcus erythropolis HL 24-2, which was originally isolated as a 2,4-dinitrophenol-degrading bacterium, could also utilize picric acid as a nitrogen source after spontaneous mutation."
166,"During growth, the mutant HL PM-1 transiently accumulated an orange-red metabolite, which was identified as a hydride-Meisenheimer complex of picric acid."
167,This complex was formed as the initial metabolite and further converted with concomitant liberation of nitrite.
168,"2,4,6-Trinitrocyclohexanone was identified as a dead-end metabolite of the degradation of picric acid, indicating the addition of two hydride ions to picric acid.A bacterium (strain B1) utilizing hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride as a carbon and energy source was isolated from activated sludge and tentatively identified as a Pseudomonas sp."
169,This bacterium only grew on alkyltrimethylammonium salts (C12 to C22) and possible intermediates of hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride breakdown such as hexadecanoate and acetate.
170,Pseudomonas strain B1 did not grow on amines.
171,Simultaneous adaptation studies suggested that the bacterium oxidized only the alkyl chain of hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride.
172,This was confirmed by the stoichiometric formation of trimethylamine from hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride.
173,"The initial hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride oxygenase activity, measured by its ability to form trimethylamine, was NAD(P)H and O2 dependent."
174,"Finally, assays of aldehyde dehydrogenase, hexadecanoyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, and isocitrate lyase in cell extracts revealed the potential of Pseudomonas strain B1 to metabolize the alkyl chain via beta-oxidation.The reactions involved in the bacterial metabolism of naphthalene to salicylate have been reinvestigated by using recombinant bacteria carrying genes cloned from plasmid NAH7."
175,"When intact cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 carrying DNA fragments encoding the first three enzymes of the pathway were incubated with naphthalene, they formed products of the dioxygenase-catalyzed ring cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene."
176,These products were separated by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 and were identified by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate (HCCA) and trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate (tHBPA).
177,"HCCA was detected as the first reaction product in these incubation mixtures by its characteristic UV spectrum, which slowly changed to a spectrum indicative of an equilibrium mixture of HCCA and tHBPA."
178,Isomerization of either purified product occurred slowly and spontaneously to give an equilibrium mixture of essentially the same composition.
179,tHBPA is also formed from HCCA by the action of an isomerase enzyme encoded by plasmid NAH7.
180,"The gene encoding this enzyme, nahD, was cloned on a 1.95-kb KpnI-BglII fragment."
181,Extracts of Escherichia coli JM109 carrying this fragment catalyzed the rapid equilibration of HCCA and tHBPA.
182,Metabolism of tHBPA to salicylaldehyde by hydration and aldol cleavage is catalyzed by a single enzyme encoded by a 1-kb MluI-StuI restriction fragment.
183,A mechanism for the hydratase-aldolase-catalyzed reaction is proposed.
184,"The salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase gene, nahF, was cloned on a 2.75-kb BamHI fragment which also carries the naphthalene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase gene, nahB."
185,"On the basis of the identification of the enzymes encoded by various clones, the gene order for the nah operon was shown to be p, A, B, F, C, E, D.During the course of the transformation of 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol (DCP) into (R)-3-chloro-1,2-propanediol  with the cell extract of Corynebacterium sp."
186,"strain N-1074, epichlorohydrin (ECH) was transiently formed."
187,The cell extract was fractionated into two DCP-dechlorinating activities (fractions Ia and Ib) and two ECH-hydrolyzing activities (fractions IIa and IIb) by TSKgel DEAE-5PW column chromatography.
188,"Fractions Ia and Ib catalyzed the interconversion of DCP to ECH, and fractions IIa and IIb catalyzed the transformation of ECH into MCP."
189,"Fractions Ia and IIa showed only low enantioselectivity for each reaction, whereas fractions Ib and IIb exhibited considerable enantioselectivity, yielding R-rich ECH and MCP, respectively."
190,"Enzymes Ia and Ib were isolated from fractions Ia and Ib, respectively."
191,Enzyme Ia had a molecular mass of about 108 kDa and consisted of four subunits identical in molecular mass (about 28 kDa).
192,"Enzyme Ib was a protein of 115 kDa, composed of two different polypeptides (about 35 and 32 kDa)."
193,The specific activity of enzyme Ib for DCP was about 30-fold higher than that of enzyme Ia.
194,Both enzymes catalyzed the transformation of several halohydrins into the corresponding epoxides with liberation of halides and its reverse reaction.
195,Their substrate specificities and immunological properties differed from each other.
196,Enzyme Ia seemed to be halohydrin hydrogen-halide-lyase which was already purified from Escherichia coli carrying a gene from Corynebacterium sp.
197,strain N-1074.We conducted a series of toxicity tests and short-term mutagenic assays of Asulam and 40% (W/V) sodium Asulam.
198,"It was found that the LD50 of Asulam with acute oral toxicity was 30000 mg/kg for mice, and the LD50 of sodium Asulam for mice and rats were equal (8250 mg/kg)."
199,The cumulative coefficient of sodium Asulam in Wistar rats was 9.42.
200,None died from sodium Asulam absorbed via skin.
201,"Negative results were obtained in Ames test, Bacillus subtilis repair test and the micronucleus test."
202,There was no significant difference between the control group and the treated groups in the chromosomal aberration rates of spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes of mice testis.
203,The results indicated that Asulam should be regarded as a substance of low toxicity and low accumulation.
204,No mutagenicity was observed in our experiment.The alkBFGHJKL and alkST operons encode enzymes that allow Pseudomonas putida (oleovorans) to metabolize alkanes.
205,"In this paper we report the nucleotide sequence of a 4592 bp region of the alkBFGHJKL operon encoding the AlkJ, AlkK and AlkL polypeptides."
206,The alkJ gene encodes a protein of 59 kilodaltons.
207,"The predicted amino acid sequence shows significant homology with four flavin proteins: choline dehydrogenase, a glucose dehydrogenase and two oxidases."
208,AlkJ is membrane-bound and converts aliphatic medium-chain-length alcohols into aldehydes.
209,The properties of AlkJ suggest that it is linked to the electron transfer chain.
210,AlkJ is necessary for growth on alkanes only in P. putida alcohol dehydrogenase (AlcA) mutants.
211,AlkK is homologous to a range of proteins which act by an ATP-dependent covalent binding of AMP to their substrate.
212,"This list includes the acetate, coumarate and long-chain fatty acid CoA ligases."
213,"The alkK gene complements a fadD mutation in Escherichia coli, which shows that it indeed encodes an acyl-CoA synthetase."
214,AlkK is a 60 kilodalton protein located in the cytoplasm.
215,"AlkL is homologous to OmpW, a Vibrio cholerae outer membrane protein of unknown function, and a hypothetical polypeptide encoded by ytt4 in E. coli."
216,"AlkL, OmpW and Ytt4 all have a signal peptide and end with a sequence characteristic of outer membrane proteins."
217,The alkL gene product was found in the outer membrane of E. coli W3110 containing the alk-genes.
218,The alkL gene can be deleted without a clear effect on growth rate.
219,Its function remains unknown.
220,"The G+C content of the alkJKL genes is 45%, identical to that of the alkBFGH genes, and significantly lower than the G+C content of the OCT-plasmid and the P. putida chromosome.Biological conversion of the herbicide bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile) was studied in a batch culture of Pseudomonas putida by using HPLC."
221,"The process had a cometabolic character and proceeded only in the presence of another, simultaneously metabolizable, carbon and energy source."
222,"The intensity of degradation correlated with the growth rate, the degradation stopping when the cosubstrate becomes exhausted or the pH value of the medium falls below 6.5."
223,"In a medium with glucose, no lag phase longer than one day was observed concerning growth, sugar and herbicide consumption and formation of metabolic herbicide derivatives (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzamide and 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid)."
224,"In a medium with ribose, the initial lag of the above processes took 2 d. No formation of other degradation products was detected."
225,"Growth inhibition was proportional to the concentration of bromoxynil.Intact cells of (+/-)camphor-grown Pseudomonas putida, ATCC17453(CAM), have been shown to oxidize readily the monoketone derivative of cage hydrocarbon adamantane, forming oxygenated products indicative of both biological Baeyer-Villiger and hydroxylation reactions."
226,"Formed products were identified as 4-oxahomoadamantan-5-one, 5-hydroxyadamantan-2-one and 1-hydroxy-4-oxahomoadamantan-5-one."
227,"Minor products formed as a result of secondary reactions were tentatively identified as syn- and anti-1,4-dihydroxyadamantanes and bicyclononan-3-ol."
228,Adamantanone initial concentrations determined whether 1-hydroxy-4-oxahomoadamantan-5-one was the sole product (below 120 mg/l) or 4-oxahomoadamantan-5-one was the principle (up to 92%) product (240-600 mg/l).
229,"Formation of 1-hydroxy-4-oxahomoadamantan-5-one appears to occur by two routes determined by the sequence of lactonization and hydroxylation.Trichloroethylene (TCE) was reductively dechlorinated to cis-dichloroethylene, trans-dichloroethylene, 1,1-dichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, and ethylene by the CO-reduced CO dehydrogenase enzyme complex from Methanosarcina thermophila; the apparent Km and Vmax values were 1.7 +/- 0.3 mM TCE and 26.2 +/- 1.7 mol TCE dechlorinated/min/mmol factor III."
230,Factor III also catalysed the dechlorination of TCE when in the presence of titanium(III) citrate; the apparent Km and Vmax values were 1.2 +/- 0.3 mM TCE and 34.9 +/- 3.6 mol TCE dechlorinated/min/mmol factor III.
231,The enzyme complex was resolved into the two-subunit nickel/iron-sulfur (Ni/Fe-S) component and the two-subunit factor III-containing corrinoid/iron-sulfur (Co/Fe-S) component.
232,"The Ni/Fe-S component was unable to dechlorinate TCE in the presence of CO; however, reconstitution with the Co/Fe-S component yielded the same dechlorinated products as with the CO dehydrogenase enzyme complex.In the course of our screening for dibenzo-p-dioxin-utilizing bacteria, a Sphingomonas sp."
233,strain was isolated from enrichment cultures inoculated with water samples from the river Elbe.
234,"The isolate grew with both the biaryl ethers dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran (DF) as the sole sources of carbon and energy, showing doubling times of about 8 and 5 h, respectively."
235,"Biodegradation of the two aromatic compounds initially proceeded after an oxygenolytic attack at the angular position adjacent to the ether bridge, producing 2,2\',3-trihydroxydiphenyl ether or 2,2\',3-trihydroxybiphenyl from the initially formed dihydrodiols, which represent extremely unstable hemiacetals."
236,Results obtained from determinations of enzyme activities and oxygen consumption suggest meta cleavage of the trihydroxy compounds.
237,"During dibenzofuran degradation, hydrolysis of 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-hexa-2,4-dienoate yielded salicylate, which was branched into the catechol meta cleavage pathway and the gentisate pathway."
238,"Catechol obtained from the product of meta ring fission of 2,2\',3-trihydroxydiphenyl ether was both ortho and meta cleaved by Sphingomonas sp."
239,"strain RW1 when this organism was grown with dibenzo-p-dioxin.A thiocyanate hydrolase that catalyzes the first step in thiocyanate degradation was purified to homogeneity from Thiobacillus thioparus, an obligate chemolithotrophic eubacterium metabolizing thiocyanate to sulfate as an energy source."
240,"The thiocyanate hydrolase was purified 52-fold by steps involving ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography, and hydroxylapatite column chromatography."
241,The enzyme hydrolyzed 1 mol of thiocyanate to form 1 mol of carbonyl sulfide and 1 mol of ammonia as follows: SCN- + 2H2O----COS + NH3 + OH-.
242,This is the first report describing the hydrolysis of thiocyanate to carbonyl sulfide by an enzyme.
243,"The enzyme had a molecular mass of 126 kDa and was composed of three different subunits: alpha (19 kDa), beta (23 kDa), and gamma (32 kDa)."
244,The enzyme exhibited optimal activities at pH 7.5-8.0 and at temperatures ranging from 30 to 40 degrees C. The Km value for thiocyanate was approximately 11 mM.
245,"Immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies against the purified enzyme suggested that it was induced in T. thioparus cells when the cells were grown with thiocyanate.The nucleotide sequences of two genes involved in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) degradation, by Pseudomonas, have been determined."
246,"One of these, sdsA, codes for an alkyl sulfatase (58,957 Da) and has similarity (31.8% identity over a 201-amino acid stretch) to the N terminus of a predicted protein of unknown function from Mycobacterium tuberculosis."
247,"The other gene, sdsB, codes for a positive activator protein (33,600 Da) that has extensive similarity with the lysR family of helix-turn-helix DNA-binding activator proteins.The enzymes catalyzing the initial reactions in the anaerobic degradation of 2-aminobenzoic acid (anthranilic acid) were studied with a denitrifying Pseudomonas sp."
248,anaerobically grown with 2-aminobenzoate and nitrate as the sole carbon and energy sources.
249,"Cells grown on 2-aminobenzoate are simultaneously adapted to growth with benzoate, whereas cells grown on benzoate degrade 2-aminobenzoate several times less efficiently than benzoate."
250,Evidence for a new reductive pathway of aromatic metabolism and for four enzymes catalyzing the initial steps is presented.
251,"The organism contains 2-aminobenzoate-coenzyme A ligase (2-aminobenzoate-CoA ligase), which forms 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA."
252,"2-Aminobenzoyl-CoA is then reductively deaminated to benzoyl-CoA by an oxygen-sensitive enzyme, 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA reductase (deaminating), which requires a low potential reductant ."
253,The specific activity is 15 nmol of 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA reduced min-1 mg-1 of protein at an optimal pH of 7.
254,The two enzymes are induced by the substrate under anaerobic conditions only.
255,Benzoyl-CoA is further converted in vitro by reduction with Ti(III) to six products; the same products are formed when benzoyl-CoA or 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA is incubated under reducing conditions.
256,Two of them were identified preliminarily.
257,"One product is cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA, the other is trans-2-hydroxycyclohexane-carboxyl-CoA."
258,"The complex transformation of benzoyl-CoA is ascribed to at least two enzymes, benzoyl-CoA reductase (aromatic ring reducing) and cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA hydratase."
259,The reduction of benzoyl-CoA to alicyclic compounds is catalyzed by extracts from cells grown anaerobically on either 2-aminobenzoate or benzoate at almost the same rate (10 to 15 nmol min-1 mg-1 of protein).
260,"In contrast, extracts from cells grown anaerobically on acetate or grown aerobically on benzoate or 2-aminobenzoate are inactive."
261,This suggests a sequential induction of the enzymes.A pentachlorophenol (PCP)-degrading Flavobacterium sp.
262,(strain ATCC 39723) degraded bromoxynil with the production of bromide and cyanide.
263,No aromatic intermediates were detected in the spent culture fluid.
264,The cyanide produced upon bromoxynil metabolism was inhibitory to the Flavobacterium sp.
265,Whole cells degraded PCP more rapidly than they did bromoxynil.
266,"Bromoxynil metabolism and PCP metabolism were coinduced, either substrate serving as the inducer."
267,Purified PCP hydroxylase degraded bromoxynil with stoichiometric accumulation of cyanide and without bromide production.
268,"A product accumulated which was more hydrophilic than bromoxynil upon high-pressure liquid chromatographic analysis and which, when analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, had a mass spectrum consistent with that expected for dibromohydroquinone."
269,"PCP hydroxylase consumed NADPH, oxygen, and bromoxynil in a 2:1:1 molar ratio, producing 1 mol of cyanide per mol of bromoxynil degraded."
270,We propose a pathway by which bromoxynil is metabolized by the same enzymes which degrade PCP.
271,"The initial step in the pathway is the conversion of bromoxynil to 2,6-dibromohydroquinone by PCP hydroxylase."
272,"In addition to its utility for decontaminating PCP-polluted sites, the Flavobacterium sp."
273,may be useful for decontaminating bromoxynil spills.
274,"This is the first report of cyanide production accompanying the metabolism of a benzonitrile derivative.The ligninolytic fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium oxidized phenanthrene and phenanthrene-9,10-quinone (PQ) at their C-9 and C-10 positions to give a ring-fission product, 2,2\'-diphenic acid (DPA), which was identified in chromatographic and isotope dilution experiments."
275,DPA formation from phenanthrene was somewhat greater in low-nitrogen (ligninolytic) cultures than in high-nitrogen (nonligninolytic) cultures and did not occur in uninoculated cultures.
276,"The oxidation of PQ to DPA involved both fungal and abiotic mechanisms, was unaffected by the level of nitrogen added, and was significantly faster than the cleavage of phenanthrene to DPA."
277,"Phenanthrene-trans-9,10-dihydrodiol, which was previously shown to be the principal phenanthrene metabolite in nonligninolytic P. chrysosporium cultures, was not formed in the ligninolytic cultures employed here."
278,"These results suggest that phenanthrene degradation by ligninolytic P. chrysosporium proceeds in order from phenanthrene----PQ----DPA, involves both ligninolytic and nonligninolytic enzymes, and is not initiated by a classical microsomal cytochrome P-450."
279,The extracellular lignin peroxidases of P. chrysosporium were not able to oxidize phenanthrene in vitro and therefore are also unlikely to catalyze the first step of phenanthrene degradation in vivo.
280,"Both phenanthrene and PQ were mineralized to similar extents by the fungus, which supports the intermediacy of PQ in phenanthrene degradation, but both compounds were mineralized significantly less than the structurally related lignin peroxidase substrate pyrene was.Pseudomonas paucimobilis UT26 is capable of growing on gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH)."
281,A genomic library of P. paucimobilis UT26 was constructed in Pseudomonas putida by using the broad-host-range cosmid vector pKS13.
282,"After 2,300 clones were screened by gas chromatography, 3 clones showing gamma-HCH degradation were detected."
283,"A 5-kb fragment from one of the cosmid clones was subcloned into pUC118, and subsequent deletion and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses revealed that a fragment of ca."
284,"500 bp was responsible for the conversion of gamma-HCH to 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene via gamma-pentachlorocyclohexene."
285,Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame (linA) of 465 bp within the fragment.
286,The nucleotide sequence of the linA gene and the deduced amino acid sequence showed no similarity to any known sequences.
287,The product of the linA gene was 16.5 kDa according to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Two bacterial strains were isolated with 3-chloroacrylic acid (CAA) as sole source of carbon and energy.
288,"Strain CAA1, a Pseudomonas cepacia sp., was capable of growth with only the cis-isomer of CAA."
289,"Strain CAA2, a coryneform bacterium, utilized both isomers of CAA as sole source of carbon and energy."
290,"Strain CAA1 contained cis-CAA hydratase and strain CAA2 contained two hydratases, one with cis-CAA hydratase activity and one with trans-CAA hydratase activity."
291,The product of the hydratase activities with CAA was malonate semialdehyde.
292,In both strains malonate semialdehyde was subsequently decarboxylated by a cofactor-independent decarboxylase yielding acetaldehyde and CO2.Soil from a pesticide disposal site was used to enrich for microorganisms that degraded the acylanilide herbicide propachlor (2-chloro-N-isopropylacetanilide).
293,"After seven transfers of the enrichment, the culture contained about six strains."
294,"The highest yield of microbial biomass occurred if just two of these isolates, strains DAK3 and MAB2, were inoculated into a mineral salts medium containing propachlor."
295,"When only strain DAK3 was grown on propachlor, a metabolite (2-chloro-N-isopropylacetamide) was released into the medium."
296,Strain MAB2 could grow on this metabolite.
297,"The results of morphological and physiological tests suggest that strains DAK3 and MAB2 most closely resemble species belonging to the genera Moraxella and Xanthobacter, respectively."
298,"Strain DAK3 can respire and grow on N-substituted acylanilides containing methyl, ethyl, or isopropyl substitutions, but is incapable of respiration or growth on acetanilide, aniline, or the acylanilide herbicides alachlor and metolachlor."
299,"Strain DAK3 appears to use the aromatic C atoms of propachlor for growth, as suggested by the growth yield on propachlor and the induction of catechol 2,3-oxygenase activity in acylanilide-grown cells.Under anaerobic conditions the sulfonated azo dye Mordant Yellow 3 was reduced by the biomass of a bacterial consortium grown aerobically with 6-aminonaphthalene-2-sulfonic acid."
300,Stoichiometric amounts of the aromatic amines 6-aminonaphthalene-2-sulfonate and 5-aminosalicylate were generated and excreted into the medium.
301,"After re-aeration of the culture, these amines were mineralized by different members of the bacterial culture."
302,"Thus, total degradation of a sulfonated azo dye was achieved by using an alternating anaerobic-aerobic treatment."
303,"The ability of the mixed bacterial culture to reduce the azo dye was correlated with the presence of strain BN6, which possessed the ability to oxidize various naphthalenesulfonic acids."
304,It is suggested that strain BN6 has a transport system for naphthalenesulfonic acids which also catalyzes uptake of sulfonated azo dyes.
305,These dyes are then gratuitously reduced in the cytoplasm by unspecific reductases.A series of halogenated propanes were studied for renal and testicular necrogenic effects in the rat and correlated to their ability to induce in vivo renal and testicular DNA damage and in vitro testicular DNA damage.
306,"1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP) and 1,2,3-tribromopropane were most potent in causing organ damage in both kidney and testes."
307,Extensive necrosis was evident at 85 mumol/kg in kidney and at 170 mumol/kg in testis.
308,"The dibromomonochlorinated analogue 1,3-dibromo-2-chloropropane was less organ toxic than DBCP and 1,2,3-tribromopropane, but induced more organ damage than the dichloromonobrominated analogues 1-bromo-2,3-dichloropropane and 1,3-dichloro-2-bromopropane."
309,Dihalogenated propanes were even less necrogenic.
310,These observed differences in toxic potency between the halogenated propanes could not be explained by relative differences in tissue concentrations.
311,The ability of the halogenated propanes to induce DNA damage in vivo correlated well with their ability to induce organ damage.
312,"However, DNA damage occurred at lower doses and at a shorter period of exposure than organ necrosis."
313,This indicates that DNA damage might be an initial event in the development of organ necrosis by halogenated propanes in general.
314,"Further, testicular DNA damage induced by the halogenated propanes in vivo correlated well with the DNA damage observed in isolated testicular cells in vitro, showing that toxicity was due to in situ activation."
315,"The numbers, positions, and the types of halogen substituents appear to be important determinants in causing DNA damage and necrogenic effects."
316,(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)Microbial enzyme systems may be used in the biodegradation of persistent environmental pollutants.
317,"The three polypeptide components of one such system, the 4-chlorobenzoate dehalogenase system, have been isolated, and the chemical steps of the 4-hydroxybenzoate-forming reaction that they catalyze have been identified."
318,The genes contained within a 4.5-kilobase Pseudomonas sp.
319,strain CBS3 chromosomal DNA fragment that encode dehalogenase activity were selectively expressed in transformed Escherichia coli.
320,"Oligonucleotide sequencing revealed a stretch of homology between the 57-kilodalton (kD) polypeptide and several magnesium adenosine triphosphate (MgATP)-cleaving enzymes that allowed MgATP and coenzyme A (CoA) to be identified as the dehalogenase cosubstrate and cofactor, respectively."
321,"The dehalogenase activity arises from two components, a 4-chlorobenzoate:CoA ligase-dehalogenase (an alpha beta dimer of the 57- and 30-kD polypeptides) and a thioesterase (the 16-kD polypeptide).Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 metabolizes toluene as a carbon source by a previously unknown pathway."
322,The initial step of the pathway is hydroxylation of toluene to form p-cresol by a multicomponent toluene-4-monooxygenase (T4MO) system.
323,The T4MO enzyme system has broad substrate specificity and provides a new opportunity for biodegradation of toxic compounds and bioconversions.
324,Its known activities include conversion of a variety of phenyl compounds into the phenolic derivatives and the complete degradation of trichloroethylene.
325,We have cloned and characterized a gene cluster from KR1 that determines the offO activity.
326,"To clone the T4MO genes, KR1 DNA libraries were constructed in Escherichia coli HB101 by using a broad-host-range vector and transferred to a KR1 mutant able to grow on p-cresol but not on toluene."
327,An insert consisting of two SacI fragments of identical size (10.2 kb) was shown to complement the mutant for growth on toluene.
328,"One of the SacI fragments, when cloned into the E. coli vector pUC19, was found to direct the synthesis of indigo dye."
329,The indigo-forming property was correlated with the presence of T4MO activity.
330,"The T4MO genes were mapped to a 3.6-kb region, and the direction of transcription was determined."
331,"DNA sequencing and N-terminal amino acid determination identified a five-gene cluster, tmoABCDE, within this region."
332,Expression of this cluster carrying a single mutation in each gene demonstrated that each of the five genes is essential for T4MO activity.
333,"Other evidence presented indicated that none of the tmo genes was involved in the regulation of the tmo gene cluster, in the control of substrate transport for the T4MO system, or in major processing of the products of the tmo genes."
334,It was tentatively concluded that the tmoABCDE genes encode structural polypeptides of the T4MO enzyme system.
335,One of the tmo genes was tentatively identified as a ferredoxin gene.The enzymes catalyzing the formation of coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters of benzoate and 2-aminobenzoate were studied in a denitrifying Pseudomonas sp.
336,anaerobically grown with these aromatic acids and nitrate as sole carbon and energy sources.
337,"Three different rather specific aromatic acyl-CoA ligases, E1, E2, and E3, were found which catalyze the formation of CoA thioesters of benzoate, fluorobenzoates, and 2-aminobenzoate."
338,ATP is cleaved into AMP and pyrophosphate.
339,"The enzymes were purified, their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined, and their catalytic and molecular properties were studied."
340,Cells anaerobically grown on benzoate and nitrate contain one CoA ligase (AMP forming) for benzoic acid (E1).
341,"It is a homodimer of Mr 120,000 which prefers benzoate as a substrate but shows some activity also with 2-aminobenzoate and fluorobenzoates, although with lower Km."
342,Cells anaerobically grown on 2-aminobenzoate and nitrate contain three different CoA ligases for aromatic acids.
343,The first one is identical with benzoate-CoA ligase (E1).
344,The second enzyme is a 2-aminobenzoate-CoA ligase (E2).
345,"It is a monomer of Mr 60,000 which prefers 2-aminobenzoate but also activates benzoate, fluorobenzoates and, less effectively, 2-methylbenzoate, with lower affinities to the latter substrates."
346,The enzymes E1 and E2 have similar activity levels; a third minor CoA ligase activity is due to a different 2-aminobenzoate-CoA ligase.
347,"The enzyme (E3) is a monomer of Mr, 65,000 which 2-aminobenzoate pathway (U. Altenschmidt, C. Eckerskorn, and G. Fuchs, Eur."

349,"194:647-653, 1990); apparently, it is not completely repressed under anaerobic conditions and therefore also is induced to a small extent by 2-aminobenzoate under anaerobic growth conditions.Pseudomonas cepacia G4 possesses a novel pathway of toluene catabolism that is shown to be responsible for the degradation of trichloroethylene (TCE)."
350,This pathway involves conversion of toluene via o-cresol to 3-methylcatechol.
351,"In order to determine the enzyme of toluene degradation that is responsible for TCE degradation, chemically induced mutants, blocked in the toluene ortho-monooxygenase (TOM) pathway of G4, were examined."
352,"Mutants of the phenotypic class designated TOM A- were all defective in their ability to oxidize toluene, o-cresol, m-cresol, and phenol, suggesting that a single enzyme is responsible for conversion of these compounds to their hydroxylated products (3-methylcatechol from toluene, o-cresol, and m-cresol and catechol from phenol) in the wild type."
353,Mutants of this class did not degrade TCE.
354,"Two other mutant classes which were blocked in toluene catabolism, TOM B-, which lacked catechol-2,3-dioxygenase, and TOM C-, which lacked 2-hydroxy-6-oxoheptadienoic acid hydrolase activity, were fully capable of TCE degradation."
355,"Therefore, TCE degradation is directly associated with the monooxygenation capability responsible for toluene, cresol, and phenol hydroxylation.Furfural, a byproduct formed during the thermal/chemical pretreatment of hemicellulosic biomass, was degraded to methane and carbon dioxide under anaerobic conditions."
356,The consortium of anaerobic microbes responsible for the degradation was enriched using small continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) systems with daily batch feeding of biomass pretreatment liquor and continuous addition of furfural.
357,"Although the continuous infusion of furfural was initially inhibitory to the anaerobic CSTR system, adaptation of the consortium occurred rapidly with high rates of furfural addition."
358,"Addition rates of 7.35 mg furfural/700-mL reactor/d resulted in biogas productions of 375%, of that produced in control CSTR systems, fed the biomass pretreatment liquor only."
359,"The anaerobic CSTR system fed high levels of furfural was stable, with a sludge pH of 7.1 and methane gas composition of 69%, compared to the control CSTR, which had a pH of 7.2 and 77% methane."
360,CSTR systems in which furfural was continuously added resulted in 80% of the theoretically expected biogas.
361,Intermediates in the anaerobic biodegradation of furfural were determined by spike additions in serum-bottle assays using the enriched consortium from the CSTR systems.
362,"Furfural was converted to several intermediates, including furfuryl alcohol, furoic acid, and acetic acid, before final conversion to methane and carbon dioxide.The xylXYZ DNA region is carried on the TOL pWW0 plasmid in Pseudomonas putida and encodes a benzoate dioxygenase with broad substrate specificity."
363,"The DNA sequence of the region is presented and compared with benABC, the chromosomal region encoding the benzoate dioxygenase of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus."
364,"Corresponding genes from the two biological sources share common ancestry: comparison of aligned XylX-BenA, XylY-BenB, and XylZ-BenC amino acid sequences revealed respective identities of 58.3, 61.3, and 53%."
365,The aligned genes have diverged to assume G+C contents that differ by 14.0 to 14.9%.
366,Usage of the unusual arginine codons AGA and AGG appears to have been selected in the P. putida xylX gene as it diverged from the ancestor it shared with A. calcoaceticus benA.
367,"Homologous A. calcoaceticus and P. putida genes exhibit different patterns of DNA sequence repetition, and analysis of one such pattern suggests that mutations creating different DNA slippage structures made a significant contribution to the evolutionary divergence of xylX.Ligninolytic fungi are unique among eukaryotes in their ability to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), but the mechanism for this process is unknown."
368,"Although certain PAHs are oxidized in vitro by the fungal lignin peroxidases (LiPs) that catalyze ligninolysis, it has never been shown that LiPs initiate PAH degradation in vivo."
369,"To address these problems, the metabolism of anthracene (AC) and its in vitro oxidation product, 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ), was examined by chromatographic and isotope dilution techniques in Phanerochaete chrysosporium."
370,"The fungal oxidation of AC to AQ was rapid, and both AC and AQ were significantly mineralized."
371,"Both compounds were cleaved by the fungus to give the same ring-fission metabolite, phthalic acid, and phthalate production from AQ was shown to occur only under ligninolytic culture conditions."
372,These results show that the major pathway for AC degradation in Phanerochaete proceeds AC----AQ----phthalate + CO2 and that it is probably mediated by LiPs and other enzymes of ligninolytic metabolism.Pseudomonas sp.
373,"strain P51 is able to use 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as sole carbon and energy sources."
374,"Two gene clusters involved in the degradation of these compounds were identified on a catabolic plasmid, pP51, with a size of 110 kb by using hybridization."
375,"They were further characterized by cloning in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida KT2442, and Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP222."
376,"Expression studies in these organisms showed that the upper-pathway genes (tcbA and tcbB) code for the conversion of 1,2-dichlorobenzene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene to 3,4-dichlorocatechol and 3,4,6-trichlorocatechol, respectively, by means of a dioxygenase system and a dehydrogenase."
377,"The lower-pathway genes have the order tcbC-tcbD-tcbE and encode a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase II, a cycloisomerase II, and a hydrolase II, respectively."
378,"The combined action of these enzymes degrades 3,4-dichlorocatechol and 3,4,6-trichlorocatechol to a chloromaleylacetic acid."
379,"The release of one chlorine atom from 3,4-dichlorocatechol takes place during lactonization of 2,3-dichloromuconic acid.In an earlier publication, we reported that corrinoids catalyze the sequential reduction of CCl4 to CHCl3, CH2Cl2, CH3Cl, and CH4 with titanium(III) citrate as electron donor ."
380,"However, the recovery of these products was less than 50%, indicating that other products were formed."
381,"We now report that, under the same experimental conditions, CCl4 is also converted to carbon monoxide."
382,"These studies were extended to include FREONs 11, 12, 13, and 14."
383,"Corrinoids were found to catalyze the reduction of CFCl3, CF2Cl2, and CF3Cl to CO and, in the case of CFCl3, to a lesser extent, to formate."
384,CF4 was not reduced.
385,The rate of CO and formate formation paralleled that of fluoride release.
386,"Both rates decreased in the series CFCl3, CF2Cl2, CCl4, and CF3Cl."
387,"The reduction of CFCl3 gave, in addition to CO and formate, CHFCl2, CH2FCl, CH3F, C2F2Cl2, and C2F2Cl4."
388,"The product pattern indicates that the corrinoid-mediated reduction of halogenated C1-hydrocarbons involves the intermediacy of dihalocarbenes, which may be a reason why these compounds are highly toxic for anaerobic bacteria.A protein was purified from crude extracts of the soil fungus Myrothecium verrucaria by gel filtration and hydrophobic chromatography to homogeneity; this protein catalyzed the stoichiometric hydration of the fertilizer cyanamide to urea with high substrate specificity."
389,"This cyanamide hydratase (urea hydro-lyase; EC 4.2.1.69) contained zinc and consisted of six identical subunits with Mr = 27,700."
390,It was partially sequenced.
391,The protein was detectable only when the fungus was grown on cyanamide as the sole nitrogen source.
392,"Genomic DNA from the fungus was cloned, and the gene encoding the enzyme was mapped with an oligonucleotide probe derived from the amino acid sequence within a 25,800-base-pair DNA region."
393,The subunit of the enzyme is encoded by a 795-base-pair DNA sequence containing a 63-base-pair intron.
394,A cDNA clone containing the intronless gene with an open reading frame encoding a sequence of 244 amino acids expressed the enzyme in active form in Escherichia coli with excellent yield.Several hundred million tons of toxic mercurials are dispersed in the biosphere.
395,"Microbes can detoxify organo-mercurials and mercury salts through sequential action of two enzymes, organomercury lyase and mercuric ion reductase (MerA)."
396,"The latter, a homodimer with homology to the FAD-dependent disulphide oxidoreductases, catalyses the reaction NADPH + Hg(II)----NADP+ + H+ + Hg(0), one of the very rare enzymic reactions with metal substrates."
397,"Human glutathione reductase serves as a reference molecule for FAD-dependent disulphide reductases and between its primary structure and that of MerA from Tn501 (Pseudomonas), Tn21 (Shigella), p1258 (Staphylococcus) and Bacillus, 25-30% of the residues have been conserved."
398,All MerAs have a C-terminal extension about 15 residues long but have very varied N termini.
399,"Although the enzyme from Streptomyces lividans has no addition, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Tn501 and Bacillus sp."
400,"strain RC607 it has one and two copies respectively of a domain of 80-85 residues, highly homologous to MerP, the periplasmic component of proteins encoded by the mer operon."
401,These domains can be proteolytically cleaved off without changing the catalytic efficiency.
402,We report here the crystal structure of MerA from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus sp.
403,strain RC607.
404,Analysis of its complexes with nicotinamide dinucleotide substrates and the inhibitor Cd(II) reveals how limited structural changes enable an enzyme to accept as substrate what used to be a dangerous inhibitor.
405,Knowledge of the mode of mercury ligation is a prerequisite for understanding this unique detoxification mechanism.The possible genotoxic effects of the organophosphorus insecticides methyl parathion and triazophos were evaluated by their ability to induce gene and chromosome mutations in male germ cells of Drosophila melanogaster.
406,"Sex-linked recessive lethal (SLRL), total and partial sex-chromosome losses (SCL), and non-disjunction (ND) assays were conducted."
407,"The routes of administration included adult feeding, injection, and larval feeding."
408,"Methyl parathion was unable to induce point mutations or chromosome mutations, although a small increase in the frequency of non-disjunction was detected after larval treatment."
409,"Triazophos induced point mutations when assayed in the SLRL test and induced a weak increase in the non-disjunction frequency, but gave negative results in the SCL test.The constitutive xanthine dehydrogenase and the inducible 2-furoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase could be labeled with tungstate."
410,This labeling was used as a reporter to purify both labile proteins.
411,The radioactivity cochromatographed predominantly with the residual enzymatic activity of both enzymes during the first purification steps.
412,Both radioactive proteins were separated and purified to homogeneity.
413,"Antibodies raised against the larger protein also exhibited cross-reactivity toward the second smaller protein and removed xanthine dehydrogenase and 2-furoyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity up to 80 and 60% from the supernatant of cell extracts, respectively."
414,"With use of cell extract, Western immunoblots showed only two bands which correlated exactly with the activity stains for both enzymes after native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."
415,"Molybdate was absolutely required for incorporation of 185W, formation of cross-reacting material, and enzymatic activity."
416,The latter parameters showed a perfect correlation.
417,This evidence proves that the radioactive proteins were actually xanthine dehydrogenase and 2-furoyl-CoA dehydrogenase.
418,"The apparent molecular weight of the native xanthine dehydrogenase was about 300,000, and that of 2-furoyl-CoA dehydrogenase was 150,000."
419,"Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of both enzymes revealed two protein bands corresponding to molecular weights of 55,000 and 25,000."
420,"The xanthine dehydrogenase contained at least 1.6 mol of molybdenum, 0.9 ml of cytochrome b, 5.8 mol of iron, and 2.4 mol of labile sulfur per mol of enzyme."
421,"The composition of the 2-furoyl-CoA dehydrogenase seemed to be similar, although the stoichiometry was not determined."
422,The oxidation of furfuryl alcohol to furfural and further to 2-furoic acid by Pseudomonas putida Fu1 was catalyzed by two different dehydrogenases.1.
423,"A strain of Azotobacter chroococcum which could use 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) as sole carbon source was isolated."
424,2
425,"The strain metabolized 2,4-D via p-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, p-chlorophenol and 4-chlorocatechol; the last metabolite was cleaved by catechol 1,2-dioxygenase."
426,3
427,The enzyme exhibited broad substrate specificity.Bacterial strains (190) capable of growth on epsilon-caprolactam as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen were isolated from epsilon-caprolactam industrial sewage.
428,Most of the strains (90%) were found to contain plasmids.
429,Some of the strains (36.8%) assigned provisionally to the genus Pseudomonas contained plasmids controlling epsilon-caprolactam catabolism.
430,The plasmids had a molecular mass from 50 to 300 MDa.
431,Certain plasmids differed in the frequency of conjugation transfer and in the presence of other genetic determinants (resistance against heavy metal ions) and also determined the different character of bacterial growth on epsilon-caprolactam and on its intermediate catabolites.The electron flux through the MoFe-protein of nitrogenase from Klebsiella pneumoniae determines the absolute and relative rates of 2H+ reduction to H2 and acetylene (C2H2) reduction to ethylene (C2H4) at saturating levels of reductant (Na2S2O4) and MgATP.
432,"High electron flux, induced by a high Fe-protein (Kp2)/MoFe protein (Kp1) ratio, favours C2H2 reduction."
433,"These data can be explained if ethylene, the two-electron reduction product of C2H2, is not released until three electrons have been transferred from Kp2 to Kp1."
434,This explanation is also consistent with a pre-steady-state lag phase for C2H4 formation of 250 ms observed when functioning enzyme is quenched with acid.
435,Electron flux through nitrogenase is inhibited by C2H2 at high protein concentrations.
436,"This is because the association rate between Kp1 and oxidized Kp2 is enhanced by C2H2, leading to an increased steady-state concentration of the inhibitory complex Kp2oxKp1C2H2."
437,This effect is not relieved by CO.
438,"Thus CO and C2H2 (or C2H4) must be bound at the same time to distinct sites, presumably at Mo or Fe centres, on the enzyme.Permeabilized cells and cell extracts of Pelobacter acidigallici catalyzed the conversion of pyrogallol (1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene) to phloroglucinol (1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene) in the presence of 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene."
439,Pyrogallol consumption by resting cells stopped after lysis by French press or mild detergent (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ) treatment.
440,"Addition of 1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene to the assay mixture restored pyrogallol consumption and led to stoichiometric phloroglucinol accumulation."
441,The stoichiometry of pyrogallol conversion to phloroglucinol was independent of the amount of tetrahydroxybenzene added.
442,"The tetrahydroxybenzene concentration limited the velocity of the transhydroxylation reaction, which reached a maximum at 1.5 mM tetrahydroxybenzene (1 U/mg of protein)."
443,Transhydroxylation was shown to be reversible.
444,"The equilibrium constant of the reaction was determined, and the free-energy change (delta G degree\') of phloroglucinol formation from pyrogallol was calculated to be -15.5 kJ/mol."
445,Permeabilized cells and cell extracts also catalyzed the transfer of hydroxyl moieties between other hydroxylated benzenes.
446,"Tetrahydroxybenzene and hydroxyhydroquinone participated as hydroxyl donors and as hydroxyl acceptors in the reaction, whereas pyrogallol, resorcinol, and phloroglucinol were hydroxylated by both donors."
447,"A novel mechanism deduced from these data involves intermolecular transfer of the hydroxyl moiety from the cosubstrate (1,2,3,5-tetrahydroxybenzene) to the substrate (pyrogallol), thus forming the product (phloroglucinol) and regenerating the cosubstrate.Indole and its derivatives form a class of toxic recalcitrant environmental pollutants."
448,"The growth of Aspergillus niger was inhibited by very low concentrations (0.005 to 0.02%) of indole, even when 125- to 500-fold excess glucose was present in the medium."
449,"When 0.02% indole was added, the fungus showed a lag phase for about 30 h and the uptake of glucose was inhibited."
450,"Indole was metabolized by a new pathway via indoxyl (3-hydroxyindole), N-formylanthranilic acid, anthranilic acid, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, and catechol, which was further degraded by ortho cleavage."
451,"The enzymes N-formylanthranilate deformylase, anthranilate hydroxylase, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, and catechol dioxygenase were induced by indole as early as after 5 h of growth, and their activities were demonstrated in a cell-free system.Enzymatic conversion of 4-fluorocatechol in the simultaneous presence of partially purified preparations of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas cepacia and muconate cycloisomerase from Alcaligenes eutrophus 335 yielded a product that was unambiguously identified as (+)-4-fluoromuconolactone ."
452,"This compound was shown to be the only major product formed from 3-fluoro-cis,cis-muconate by the action of muconate cycloisomerases from A. eutrophus 335, A. eutrophus JMP134, and P. cepacia as well as by the action of dichloromuconate cycloisomerase from A. eutrophus JMP134."
453,"This finding implies that dichloromuconate cycloisomerase, like the muconate cycloisomerases, catalyzes primarily a cycloisomerization reaction, which only in the case of chloro- and bromo-substituted substrates is connected to a dehalogenation."
454,"4-Fluoromuconolactone at pH 7 decomposes by spontaneous reactions mainly to maleylacetate, which then decarboxylates to give cis-acetylacrylate."
455,"Although significant amounts of an unidentified compound are also formed from the fluorolactone, HF elimination to the two isomeric dienelactones (4-carboxymethylenebut-2-en-4-olides) is negligible."
456,"However, all spontaneous reactions proceed so slowly that an enzymatic conversion of 4-fluoromuconolactone must be assumed."
457,Participation of dienelactone hydrolases in this reaction is indicated by their induction during growth of various strains with 4-fluorobenzoate.
458,"However, experiments with cell extracts of P. putida A3.12 suggest that at least one other hydrolytic enzyme is able to contribute to 4-fluoromuconolactone conversion."
459,"In light of these observations, earlier proposals for a 4-fluorobenzoate degradative pathway are discussed.We have investigated the substrate specificity of ammonia monooxygenase in whole cells of the nitrifying bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea for a number of aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons."
460,"To determine the effect of the halogen substituent and carbon chain length on substrate reactivity, we measured the rates of oxidation of the monohalogenated ethanes (fluoroethane, chloroethane, bromoethane, and iodoethane) and n-chlorinated C1 to C4 alkanes by whole cells of N. europaea."
461,"For monohalogenated ethanes, acetaldehyde was the major organic product and little or none of any of the alternate predicted products (2-halogenated alcohols) were detected."
462,The maximum rate of haloethane oxidation increased with decreasing halogen molecular weight from iodoethane to chloroethane (19 to 221 nmol/min per mg of protein).
463,"In addition, the amount of substrate required for the highest rate of haloethane oxidation increased with decreasing halogen molecular weight."
464,"For the n-chlorinated alkanes, the rate of dechlorination, as measured by the appearance of the corresponding aldehyde product, was greatest for chloroethane and decreased dramatically for chloropropane and chlorobutane (118, 4, and 8 nmol of aldehyde formed per min per mg of protein, respectively)."
465,The concentration profiles for halocarbon oxidation by ammonia monooxygenase showed apparent substrate inhibition when ammonia was used as the reductant source.
466,"When hydrazine was used as the electron donor, no substrate inhibition was observed, suggesting that the inhibition resulted from reductant limitation.The enzymes involved in the anaerobic degradation of cyclohexanol were searched for in a denitrifying Pseudomonas species which metabolizes this alicyclic compound to CO2 anaerobically."
467,All postulated enzyme activities were demonstrated in vitro with sufficient specific activities.
468,Cyclohexanol dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of the substrate to cyclohexanone.
469,Cyclohexanone dehydrogenase oxidizes cyclohexanone to 2-cyclohexenone.
470,"2-Cyclohexenone hydratase and 3-hydroxycyclohexanone dehydrogenase convert 2-cyclohexenone via 3-hydroxycyclohexanone into 1,3-cyclohexanedione."
471,"Finally, the dione is cleaved by 1,3-cyclohexanedione hydrolase into 5-oxocaproic acid."
472,"Some kinetic and regulatory properties of these enzymes were studied.Quinoline catabolism was investigated with different bacterial strains, able to use quinoline as sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy."
473,Some degradation products of quinoline were isolated from the culture fluids and identified.
474,"With Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida we found 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, 8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, 8-hydroxycoumarin and 2,3-dihydroxyphenylpropionic acid as intermediates."
475,"With a Rhodococcus strain 2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, 6-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, a red meta-cleavage product and a blue fluorescent compound were isolated."
476,The red compound was identified as 5-hydroxy-6-(3-carboxy-3-oxopropenyl)-1H-2-pyridone.
477,From this the blue fluorescent azacoumarin 2H-pyrano-2-one--5H-6-pyridone is formed by chemical decomposition.
478,Therefore it can be considered a by-product of quinoline-degradation in Rhodococcus spec.
479,With the present results two different degradation pathways for quinoline in different microorganisms are proposed.Six bacterial strains able to use 4-fluorobenzoic acid as their sole source of carbon and energy were isolated by selective enrichment from various water and soil samples from the Stuttgart area.
480,"According to their responses in biochemical and morphological tests, the organisms were assigned to the genera Alcaligenes, Pseudomonas, and Aureobacterium."
481,"To elucidate the degradation pathway of 4-fluorobenzoate, metabolic intermediates were identified."
482,"Five gram-negative isolates degraded this substrate via 4-fluorocatechol, as described in previous studies."
483,"In growth experiments, these strains excreted 50 to 90% of the fluoride from fluorobenzoate."
484,Alcaligenes sp.
485,strains RHO21 and RHO22 used all three isomers of monofluorobenzoate.
486,Alcaligenes sp.
487,strain RHO22 also grew on 4-chlorobenzoate.
488,Aureobacterium sp.
489,"strain RHO25 transiently excreted 4-hydroxybenzoate into the culture medium during growth on 4-fluorobenzoate, and stoichiometric amounts of fluoride were released."
490,"In cell extracts from this strain, the enzymes for the conversion of 4-fluorobenzoate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate could be detected."
491,All these enzymes were inducible by 4-fluorobenzoate.
492,These data suggest a new pathway for the degradation of 4-fluorobenzoate by Aureobacterium sp.
493,"strain RHO25 via 4-hydroxybenzoate and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate.We investigated the transformation of 2,4-dichloroaniline (2,4-DiCA) and 3,4-DiCA to monochloroanilines (CA) in anaerobic pond sediment."
494,"Dechlorination of 3,4-DiCA to 3-CA started after a lag period of 3 weeks and was complete after an additional 5 weeks."
495,"Although 2,4-DiCA disappeared over 8 weeks, the appearance of a CA product could not be detected."
496,"In contrast, anaerobic bacteria in pond sediment acclimated to dehalogenate 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DiCP) or 3,4-DiCP rapidly dechlorinated 2,4-DiCA and 3,4-DiCA without any lag time."
497,"By comparison, anaerobic sediment bacteria acclimated to 3,4-DiCA rapidly degraded 3,4-DiCP without a lag."
498,"In all cases, the CA products were stable for the duration of the experiments."
499,It is concluded that cross-acclimation occurred.Microbial transformation rate constants were determined for seven amides in natural pond water.
500,A second-order mathematical rate expression served as the model for describing the microbial transformation.
501,Also investigated was the relationship between the infrared spectra and the second-order rate constants for these amides.
502,"Second-order rate constants (k2) ranged from a low of 2.0 X 10(-14) to a high of 1.1 X 10(-9) liters organism-1 h-1 for niclosamide (2\',5-dichloro-4\'-nitrosalicylanilide) and propachlor (2-chloro-N-isopropylacetanilide), respectively."
503,"The mechanism of degradation (i.e., microbially mediated hydrolysis) of the amides was consistent with that of other organic chemicals previously studied in a variety of natural waters."
504,Preliminary investigations indicate that temporal variations in measured second-order rate constants are small.
505,A simple linear regression of the infrared carbonyl-stretching frequency with log K2 gave a correlation coefficient (r2) of 0.962.Degradation of trichloroethylene (TCE) by the methanotrophic bacterium Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b was studied by using cells grown in continuous culture.
506,"TCE degradation was a strictly cometabolic process, requiring the presence of a cosubstrate, preferably formate, and oxygen."
507,M. trichosporium OB3b cells degraded TCE only when grown under copper limitation and when the soluble methane monooxygenase was derepressed.
508,"During TCE degradation, nearly total dechlorination occurred, as indicated by the production of inorganic chloride, and only traces of 2,2,2-trichloroethanol and trichloroacetaldehyde were produced."
509,TCE degradation proceeded according to first-order kinetics from 0.1 to 0.0002 mM TCE with a rate constant of 2.14 ml min-1 mg of cells-1.
510,TCE concentrations above 0.2 mM inhibited degradation in cell suspensions of 0.42 mg of cells ml-1.
511,Other chlorinated aliphatics were also degraded by M. trichosporium OB3b.
512,"Dichloromethane, chloroform, 1,1-dichloroethane, and 1,2-dichloroethane were completely degraded, with the release of stoichiometric amounts of chloride."
513,"trans-1,2-Dichloroethylene, cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, and 1,2-dichloropropane were completely converted, but not all the chloride was released because of the formation of chlorinated intermediates, e.g., trans-2,3-dichlorooxirane, cis-2,3-dichlorooxirane, and 2,3-dichloropropanol, respectively."
514,"1,1,1-Trichloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethylene, and 1,3-dichloropropylene were incompletely converted, and the first compound yielded 2,2,2-trichloroethanol as a chlorinated intermediate."
515,"The two perchlorinated compounds tested, carbon tetrachloride and tetrachloroethylene, were not converted.The toxic effects elicited by synthetic pyrethroids in animals are varied in degree and nature."
516,Their relative safety to birds and mammals contrasts sharply with their acute effects on fish and arthropods.
517,Explantation of their differences in toxicity depends on examination of all factors of their comparative toxicology.
518,"Routes of exposure are important, as are metabolism and elimination rates, especially for mammals and birds with their considerable capabilities for biotransformation."
519,Significant differences in sensitivity at the sites of toxic action may also play a role in differential responses to these insecticides.
520,"Finally, physical properties that influence the environmental disposition and subsequently affect bioavailability of the compounds in water, soil, air, produce, and nontarget species are also instrumental in determining the impact of current and future synthetic pyrethroid insecticides.A gram-positive, strictly anaerobic, motile, endospore-forming rod, tentatively identified as a proteolytic Clostridium sp., was isolated from the effluent of an anaerobic suspended-growth bioreactor."
521,"The organism was able to biotransform 1,1,1-trichloroethane, trichloromethane, and tetrachloromethane."
522,"1,1,1-Trichloroethane was completely transformed (greater than or equal to 99.5%) by reductive dehalogenation to 1,1-dichloroethane (30 to 40%) and, presumably by other mechanisms, to acetic acid (7%) and unidentified products."
523,"The reductive dehalogenation of tetrachloromethane led to the intermediate trichloromethane, which was further transformed to dichloromethane (8%) and unidentified products."
524,"The biotransformation occurred during the exponential growth phase, as well as during the stationary phase."
525,"Tetrachlorethene, trichloroethene, 1,1-dichloroethene, chloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, and dichloromethane were not biotransformed significantly by the organism.The chronic toxicity and carcinogenic potential of morpholine were evaluated in 60 Sprague-Dawley rats/sex/group receiving morpholine at mean inhalation exposure concentrations of 0, 10, 50 and 150 ppm for 6 hr/day, 5 days/week, for 104 weeks."
526,"Survival, body weight gains, organ weights, hematology, and clinical chemistries were normal in exposed groups and comparable to those of the control animals."
527,"The incidences of palpable tissue masses and of histologically confirmed neoplasia were comparable among all groups, including the control groups, and were typical of the strain and age of the rats tested."
528,"In-life clinical examinations revealed increased incidences of irritation around the eyes and nares, chromadacryorrhea, and urine stains on the fur, predominantly in high-dose animals."
529,Morpholine exposure was associated with corneal irritation seen by ophthalmoscopic examination and confirmed microscopically as keratitis limited to the highest exposure group.
530,"Irritation of the maxillary and nasoturbinates as indicated by infiltration of neutrophils, focal squamous metaplasia of the turbinate epithelium, and necrosis of the turbinate bone was observed in high-dose animals."
531,"Therefore, chronic exposure of rats to morpholine for 2 years at concentrations of 150 ppm or less revealed no carcinogenic potential or chronic systemic toxicity."
532,"Consistent with its known irritating properties, morpholine produced only local irritation, which was limited almost exclusively to high-dose animals.Nitrilase was purified from an extract of isovaleronitrile-induced cells of Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 in seven steps."
533,"In the last step, the enzyme was crystallized by adding ammonium sulfate."
534,"The crystallized enzyme appeared to be homogeneous by polyacrylamide electrophoresis, ampholyte electrofocusing and double immunodiffusion in agarose."
535,The enzyme has a molecular mass of about 78 kDa and consists of two subunits identical in molecular mass.
536,"The purified enzyme exhibits a pH optimum of 7.6 and a temperature optimum of 45 degrees C. The enzyme catalyzed stoichiometrically the hydrolysis of benzonitrile to benzoic acid and ammonia, and no formation of amide was detected."
537,"The enzyme required thiol compounds such as dithiothreitol, L-cysteine or reduced glutathione to exhibit maximum activity."
538,"The enzyme was specific for nitrile groups attached to an aromatic or heteroaromatic ring, e.g."
539,"benzonitrile, 3-chlorobenzonitrile, 4-tolunitrile, 2-furonitrile and 2-thiophenecarbonitrile."
540,"The comparison of the properties of the enzyme with other nitrilases and nitrile hydratases has been also discussed.A Klebsiella ozaenae nitrilase which converts the herbicide bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile) to 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid has been expressed at 5-10% of the total protein in Escherichia coli from a cloned K. ozaenae DNA segment and purified 10.3-fold to homogeneity."
541,"The purified polypeptide is molecular weight 37,000 in size, but the active form of the enzyme is composed of two identical subunits."
542,The purified enzyme exhibits a pH optimum of 9.2 and a temperature optimum of 35 degrees C. The purified enzyme is also quite sensitive to thiol-specific reagents.
543,The nitrilase is highly specific for bromoxynil as substrate with a Km of 0.31 mM and Vmax of 15 mumol of NH3 released/min/mg protein.
544,Analysis of bromoxynil-related substrates indicates the enzyme exhibits preference for compounds containing two meta-positioned halogen atoms.
545,"Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 1,212-base pair PstI-HincII DNA segment containing the locus (bxn) encoding the bromoxynil-specific nitrilase reveals a single open reading frame encoding a polypeptide 349 amino acids in length."
546,The predicted sequence of the purified enzyme was derived from the nucleotide sequence of the bxn gene.Phthalate oxygenase catalyzes the oxygenation of phthalate to form a cis-dihydrodiol.
547,It is comprised of two proteins: a flavo-iron-sulfur protein with NADH-dependent oxidoreductase activity (POR) and a nonheme iron protein with oxygenase activity (PO).
548,The latter is a tetramer of 48 kDa units and contains a Rieske  center and one mononuclear iron per monomer.
549,The mononuclear iron is likely the site of oxygenation.
550,This system can be isolated in large quantities and is sufficiently stable for detailed mechanistic studies.
551,"We briefly describe some of our studies on this system which include kinetics, and visible, magnetic resonance, EXAFS, and ENDOR spectroscopies.Phloroglucinol reductase was purified 90-fold to homogeneity from the anaerobic rumen organism Eubacterium oxidoreducens strain G-41."
552,The enzyme is stable in the presence of air and is found in the soluble fraction after ultracentrifugation of cell extract.
553,"Ion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and affinity chromatography were used to purify the enzyme."
554,"The native Mr is 78,000, and the subunit Mr is 33,000 indicating an alpha 2 homodimer."
555,The enzyme is specific for phloroglucinol and NADPH.
556,"The Km and Vmax are 600 microM and 640 mumol min-1 mg-1 (pH 7.2) for phloroglucinol, and 6.7 microM and 550 mumol min-1 mg-1 (pH 6.8) for NADPH; the Km and Vmax for the reverse direction are 290 microM and 140 mumol min-1 mg-1 (pH 7.2) for dihydrophloroglucinol, and 27 microM and 220 mumol min-1 mg-1 (pH 7.2) for NADP."
557,Temperature and pH optima are 40 degrees C and 7.8 in the forward direction.
558,The pure enzyme is colorless in solution and flavins are absent.
559,"Analysis for cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, vanadium, tungsten, selenium, copper, nickel, iron, and zinc indicated that these metals are not components of the phloroglucinol reductase."
560,"Cupric chloride, n-ethylmaleimide, and p-chloromercuribenzoate are potent inhibitors of enzyme activity."
561,The properties of phloroglucinol reductase indicate that it functions in the pathway of anaerobic degradation of trihydroxybenzenes by catalyzing reduction of the aromatic nucleus prior to ring fission.Clinical cases of sensory neuropathy produced by a megadose of vitamin B6 have been reported in English literatures.
562,"We investigated the ordinary daily dosage and maximal dose of vitamin B6 widely adopted in Japan, and the amount of vitamin B6 per unit (per tablet, capsule or ampule) available in our medical practice."
563,We concluded that in Japan it is very rare to administer such a large dose of vitamin B6 that produced sensory neuropathy described in the literatures.
564,"In our experimental study, Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally given a total amount of 14,000 mg/kg of body weight of pyridoxine hydrochloride in ten separate doses."
565,They developed an ataxic gait.
566,The occurrence of the degeneration of nerve cell bodies and peripheral axons of lumbar primary sensory neurons were histologically demonstrated.
567,"Although in Japan no clinical cases of neuropathy produced by a megadose of vitamin B6 have been reported to our knowledge, it is necessary to be aware of the possible occurrence of such neuropathy among patients with polyneuropathy of unknown etiology or who have been receiving vitamin B6 for a long time.Pure cultures of Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, and Achromobacter sp."
568,were shown to transform five pyrethroid insecticides in the presence of Tween 80.
569,"One of the major products, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid, was further transformed to 4-hydroxy-3-phenoxybenzoic acid."
570,"Permethrin was the most rapidly transformed of the pyrethroids, with a half-life of less than 5 days.Dibenzothiophene is degraded to 3-hydroxy-2-formyl benzothiophene by various bacteria, including a strain of Pseudomonas putida that also forms dibenzothiophene sulfone via an alternate pathway."
571,"By using these end products as substrates, mixed enrichment cultures that could degrade 3-hydroxy-2-formyl benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene sulfone with the formation of CO2 were established.Toluene dioxygenase, a multicomponent enzyme system known to oxidize mononuclear aromatic hydrocarbons to cis-dihydrodiols, oxidized indene and indan to 1-indenol and 1-indanol, respectively."
572,"In addition, the enzyme catalyzed dioxygen addition to the nonaromatic double bond of indene to form cis-1,2-indandiol."
573,"The oxygen atoms in 1-indenol and cis-1,2-indandiol were shown to be derived from molecular oxygen, whereas 70% of the oxygen in 1-indanol was derived from water."
574,All of the isolated products were optically active as demonstrated by 19F NMR and HPLC discrimination of diastereomeric esters and by chiroptic methods.
575,The high optical purity of (-)-(1R)-indanol (84% enantiomeric excess) and the failure of scavengers of reactive oxygen species to inhibit the monooxygenation reaction supported the contention that the monooxygen insertion is mediated by an active-site process.
576,Experiments with 3-indene indicated that equilibration between C-1 and C-3 occurred prior to the formation of the carbon-oxygen bond to yield 1-indenol.
577,"Naphthalene dioxygenase also oxidized indan to 1-indanol, which suggested that benzylic monoxygenation may be typical of this group of dioxygenases.A naphthalene-2,6-disulfonic acid (2,6NDS)-degrading Moraxella strain was isolated from an industrial sewage plant."
578,"This culture could also be adapted to naphthalene-1,6-disulfonic acid as growth substrate."
579,"Regioselective 1,2-dioxygenation effected desulfonation and catabolism to 5-sulfosalicylic acid (5SS), which also could be used as the sole carbon source."
580,"5SS-grown cells exhibited high gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase activity."
581,"Neither 5SS- nor gentisate-grown cells oxidized 2,6NDS; therefore, 2,6NDS or an early metabolite must serve as an inducer of the initial catabolic enzyme(s).Enrichment of soil samples for organisms able to utilize the herbicide bromoxynil (3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile) as a nitrogen source yielded bacterial isolates capable of rapidly metabolizing this compound."
582,"One isolate, identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp."
583,"ozaenae, could completely convert 0.05% bromoxynil to 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid and use the liberated ammonia as a sole nitrogen source."
584,Assays of cell extracts of this organism for the ability to produce ammonia from bromoxynil revealed the presence of a nitrilase (EC 3.5.51) activity.
585,"The enzyme could not utilize 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzamide as a substrate, and no 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzamide could be detected as a product of bromoxynil transformation."
586,"Comparison of related aromatic nitriles as substrates demonstrated that the Klebsiella enzyme is highly specific for bromoxynil.The 987-base-pair coding region of the tdc gene of Escherichia coli K-12 encoding biodegradative threonine dehydratase , previously cloned in this laboratory, was sequenced."
587,"The deduced polypeptide consists of 329 amino acid residues with a calculated Mr of 35,238."
588,"Although the purified enzyme was shown to contain tryptophan, no tryptophan codon was found in the tdc reading frame."
589,"Incubation of purified Tdc with tryptophan revealed apparent ""covalent"" binding of tryptophan, indicating posttranslational modification of the enzyme."
590,"A heptapeptide, 54Thr-55Gly-56Ser-57Phe-58Lys-59Ile- 60Arg, was found to contain Lys-58, which binds pyridoxal phosphate coenzyme."
591,"A comparison of amino acid sequences between the Tdc polypeptide and the biosynthetic threonine dehydratases of yeast (encoded by ILV1) and E. coli (encoded by ilvA) and the E. coli D-serine dehydratase (DsdA, encoded by dsdA) revealed various extents of homology: five domains of the Tdc polypeptide were 63-93% homologous with the yeast enzyme, and three of these same regions were 80% homologous with the biosynthetic E. coli dehydratase; two different domains showed 67% and 83% homology with DsdA."
592,"In addition, two other sequences were highly conserved in all four proteins, one of which was shown to contain the conserved lysine residue that binds pyridoxal phosphate in the Tdc and DsdA polypeptides."
593,"These observations suggest that, despite their diverse origin and metabolic significance, these enzymes may have evolved from a common ancestral protein.Organomercurial lyase mediates the first of two steps in the microbial detoxification of organomercurial salts."
594,This enzyme encoded on the plasmid R831 obtained from Escherichia coli J53-1 has been overproduced to the level of 3% of the soluble cell protein in E. coli by a construction using the T7 promoter.
595,The enzyme has been purified to homogeneity in quantity in three steps.
596,"It is a monomer of Mr 22,400 with no detectable cofactors or metal ions."
597,"It catalyzes the protonolysis of the C-Hg bond in a wide range of organomercurial salts (primary, secondary, tertiary, alkyl, vinyl, allyl, and aryl) to the hydrocarbon and mercuric ion with turnover rates in the range of 1-240 min-1.A majority of heterotrophic bacteria isolated from soil, water, sediment, vegetation, and marine algae cultures methylated sulfide, producing methanethiol."
598,"This was demonstrated with intact cells by measuring the emission of methanethiol with a sulfur-selective chemiluminescence detector, and in cell extracts by detection of sulfide-dependent thiol methyltransferase activity."
599,"Extracts of two Pseudomonas isolates were fractionated by gel-filtration and ion-exchange chromatography, and with sulfide as the substrate a single peak of thiol methyltransferase activity was seen in each case."
600,Extracts of several bacterial strains also contained thiol methyltransferase activity with organic thiols as substrates.
601,"Thus, S-adenosylmethionine-dependent thiol methyltransferase activities are widespread in bacteria and may contribute to biogenic emissions of methylated sulfur gases and to the production of methyl thioethers.The renal changes produced by 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, a constituent of unleaded gasoline, are studied in Wistar rats."
602,The compound was given at a dose of 2 ml/kg daily by gavage dissolved in corn oil (2:1) to nine Wistar Albino rats.
603,Nine control male rats received an equivalent dose of corn oil.
604,Six animals were housed in metabowls to allow the collection of urine for enzyme and urinanalysis.
605,The remaining three animals of each group were housed in a normal animal cage.
606,"After 2 days of treatment, all the test rats were noted to have lost weight and were killed on this or on the subsequent day."
607,"Macroscopic examination of the livers and kidneys revealed no visible lesions on the kidney, but two of the rats had white, slightly raised patches on the liver."
608,"Microscopic examination demonstrated centrilobular and confluent necrosis, hydropic degeneration and vacuolation of hepatocytes."
609,"Microscopic examination of the kidneys indicated eosinophilic hyaline droplet accumulation in the cells of the tubules, and tubular dilation."
610,Analysis of plasma alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase activity revealed increases consistent with liver damage.
611,Analysis of urinary N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and alkaline phosphatase activity showed increases consistent with renal toxicity.
612,"An apparent increase in the amount of cellular debris in the urine was also found, when the sediment was examined microscopically."
613,"From this study, it would appear that 2,2,4-trimethylpentane possess hepatotoxic as well as nephrotoxic properties.Benzo(a)pyrene was oxidized with crude and purified extracellular ligninase preparations from Phanerochaete chrysosporium."
614,"Both the crude enzyme and the purified fractions oxidized the substrate to three organic soluble products, namely benzo(a)pyrene 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-quinones."
615,"These findings support the recent proposition that lignin-degrading enzymes are peroxidases, mediating oxidation of aromatic compounds via aryl cation radicals."
616,"The ligninase which was unstable in the presence of hydrogen peroxide could be stabilized by addition of 3,4-dimethoxy benzyl alcohol to the reaction mixture."
617,The oxidation of benzo(a)pyrene was enhanced in the presence of this alcohol.Pseudomonas putida B2 is able to grow on o-nitrophenol (ONP) as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen.
618,ONP was converted by a nitrophenol oxygenase to nitrite and catechol.
619,"Catechol was then attacked by a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and further degraded through an ortho-cleavage pathway."
620,"ONP derivatives which were para-substituted with a methyl-, chloro-, carboxy-, formyl- or nitro-group failed to support growth of strain B2."
621,Relevant catabolic enzymes were characterized to analyze why these derivatives were not mineralized.
622,"Nitrophenol oxygenase of strain B2 is a soluble, NADPH-dependent enzyme that is stimulated by magnesium, manganese, and calcium ions."
623,"It is active toward ONP, 4-methyl-, 4-chloro-, and to a lesser extent, 4-formyl-ONP but not toward 4-carboxy- or 4-nitro-ONP."
624,"In addition, 4-formyl-, 4-carboxy-, and 4-nitro-ONP failed to induce the formation of nitrophenol oxygenase."
625,"Catechol 1,2-dioxygenase of strain B2 is active toward catechol and 4-methyl-catechol but only poorly active toward chlorinated catechols."
626,"4-Methyl-catechol is likely to be degraded to methyl-lactones, which are often dead-end metabolites in bacteria."
627,"Thus, of the compounds tested, only unsubstituted ONP acts as an inducer and substrate for all of the enzymes of a productive catabolic pathway.5-Pyridoxic-acid oxygenase, a cytoplasmic enzyme formed when Arthrobacter Cr-7 is grown with pyridoxine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen, was purified about 190-fold to homogeneity from fully induced cells."
628,"The enzyme catalyzes Reaction a, (Formula: see text) the essential ring-opening step in the degradation of pyridoxine, and provides a second example of an FAD-dependent oxygenase that adds both two hydrogen and two oxygen atoms to its substrate."
629,"5-Pyridoxic-acid oxygenase has an isoelectric point of 4.6, functions optimally between pH 7 and 8, appears to contain a single subunit of Mr = 51,000 and one FAD (but no iron) per subunit, and is readily resolved by precipitation with ammonium sulfate at pH 3.0."
630,"FMN and riboflavin do not replace FAD as coenzyme, but their presence enhances a normally minor side reaction (Reaction b) NAD(P)H + H+ + O2----NAD(P)+ + H2O2 (b) catalyzed by the holoenzyme."
631,"Reaction b also is enhanced when the poorly utilized analogues, 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-5-carboxylic acid or NADH, replace 5-pyridoxic acid or NADPH, respectively, as substrates in Reaction a."
632,Each of the enzymes required in two different pathways for degradation of pyridoxine to anabolic intermediates has now been studied.
633,"A comparison of these two pathways and their enzymes is provided.Carbon-phosphorus bond cleavage activity, found in bacteria that utilize alkyl- and phenylphosphonic acids, has not yet been obtained in a cell-free system."
634,"Given this constraint, a systematic examination of in vivo C-P lyase activity has been conducted to develop insight into the C-P cleavage reaction."
635,"Six bacterial strains were obtained by enrichment culture, identified, and characterized with respect to their phosphonic acid substrate specificity."
636,"One isolate, Agrobacterium radiobacter, was shown to cleave the carbon-phosphorus bond of a wide range of substrates, including fosfomycin, glyphosate, and dialkyl phosphinic acids."
637,"Furthermore, this organism processed vinyl-, propenyl-, and propynylphosphonic acids, a previously uninvestigated group, to ethylene, propene, and propyne, respectively."
638,"A determination of product stoichiometries revealed that both C-P bonds of dimethylphosphinic acid are cleaved quantitatively to methane and, furthermore, that the extent of C-P bond cleavage correlated linearly with the specific growth rate for a range of substrates."
639,The broad substrate specificity of Agrobacterium C-P lyase and the comprehensive characterization of the in vivo activity make this an attractive system for further biochemical and mechanistic experiments.
640,"In addition, the failure to observe the activity in a group of gram-positive bacteria holds open the possibility that a periplasmic component may be required for in vivo expression of C-P lyase activity.Nitrile hydratase of Pseudomonas chlororaphis B23 was completely stabilized by the addition of 22 mM n-butyric acid."
641,The enzyme was purified from extracts of methacrylamide-induced cells of P. chlororaphis B23 in eight steps.
642,"At the last step, the enzyme was crystallized by adding ammonium sulfate."
643,"The crystallized enzyme appeared to be homogeneous from analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, analytical ultracentrifuge, and double diffusion in agarose."
644,The enzyme has a molecular mass of about 100 kDa and consists of four subunits identical in molecular mass (approximately 25 kDa).
645,The enzyme contained approximately 4 mol iron/mol enzyme.
646,The concentrated solution of highly purified nitrile hydratase had a pronounced greyish green color and exhibited a broad absorption in visible range with a absorption maxima at 720 nm.
647,A loss of enzyme activity occurred in parallel with the disappearance of the absorption in the visible range under a variety of conditions.
648,"The enzyme catalyzed stoichiometrically the hydration of nitrile to amide, and no formation of acid and ammonia were detected."
649,"The enzyme was active toward various aliphatic nitriles, particularly, nitriles with 3-6 carbon atoms, e.g."
650,"propionitrile, n-butyronitrile, acrylonitrile and cyclopropyl cyanide, served as the most suitable substrates.A series of substituted thioamides have been studied to establish whether their structure-activity pattern against Mycobacterium leprae is similar to that displayed against M. tuberculosis."
651,Antileprosy activity was evaluated in the mouse foot pad using both the kinetic and continuous methods.
652,Ethionamide and prothionamide were found to be the most active compounds and to be of approximately equal potency.
653,Thioisonicotinamide was about five times less active.
654,"2-t-Butyl-thioisonicotinamide, 2-dimethylamino-thioisonicotinamide, and pyrazine carbonic thioamide were inactive at the dosages tested."
655,High-pressure liquid chromatographic methods were devised to study the potential influence of pharmacological factors on their in vivo activity.
656,Fecal measurements suggested that all of the thioamides were well absorbed when fed in the diet.
657,"After intravenous administration, all of the thioamides were rapidly eliminated from the mouse."
658,The differences in their elimination rates probably played only a minor role in affecting their relative antileprosy activities.
659,"It was concluded that the structural requirements for antileprosy and antituberculosis activity of the thioamides are probably similar.Comparison of the properties of a purified benzoate-4-hydroxylase, using benzoic acid and its chlorinated derivatives as substrate, suggests that the same enzyme operates during the initial hydroxylation of benzoate, 2-chlorobenzoate (2-cba), and 3-chlorobenzoate (3-cba) in A.niger.Moraxella sp."
660,"strain G is able to utilize as sole source of carbon and nitrogen aniline, 4-fluoroaniline, 2-chloroaniline, 3-chloroaniline, 4-chloroaniline (PCA), and 4-bromoaniline but not 4-iodoaniline, 4-methylaniline, 4-methoxyaniline, or 3,4-dichloroaniline."
661,The generation time on PCA was 6 h. The pathway for the degradation of PCA was investigated by analysis of catabolic intermediates and enzyme activities.
662,Mutants of strain G were isolated to enhance the accumulation of specific pathway intermediates.
663,"PCA was converted by an aniline oxygenase to 4-chlorocatechol, which in turn was degraded via a modified ortho-cleavage pathway."
664,Synthesis of the aniline oxygenase was inducible by various anilines.
665,This enzyme exhibited a broad substrate specificity.
666,Its specific activity towards substituted anilines seemed to be correlated more with the size than with the electron-withdrawing effect of the substituent and was very low towards anilines having substituents larger than iodine or a methyl group.
667,"The initial enzyme of the modified ortho-cleavage pathway, catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, had similar characteristics to those of corresponding enzymes of pathways for the degradation of chlorobenzoic acid and chlorophenol, that is, a broad substrate specificity and high activity towards chlorinated and methylated catechols.1."
668,The first metabolic step in the biodegradation of 4-hydroxypyridine by an Agrobacterium sp.
669,"was hydroxylation to form pyridine-3,4-diol."
670,2
671,"Extracts required 1mol of O(2) and 1mol of NADH or NADPH for the conversion of 4-hydroxypyridine into pyridine-3,4-diol, suggesting that the enzyme responsible, 4-hydroxypyridine-3-hydroxylase, was a mixed function mono-oxygenase."
672,3
673,After treatment with acidic (NH(4))(2)SO(4) the enzyme required FAD for activity; FMN and riboflavin would not substitute for FAD.
674,4
675,"The rate of anaerobic reduction of FAD by NAD(P)H was increased more than tenfold in the presence of 4-hydroxypyridine, suggesting that the mechanism of hydroxylation was similar to that of other aromatic hydroxylases which are of the mono-oxygenase type."
676,5
677,The partially purified enzyme was extremely specific for its heterocyclic substrate but would utilize either NADH or NADPH.
678,6
679,4-Hydroxypyridine-3-hydroxylase was strongly inhibited by high substrate concentration (above 0.5mm) especially below pH7.5.
680,8
681,"The inflexion at pH8.4 in a pK(m) versus pH plot, together with strong inhibition by p-chloromercuribenzoate, suggested a role for thiol groups in substrate binding.1."
682,"Pyridine-3,4-diol (3,4-dihydroxypyridine, 3-hydroxypyrid-4-one), an intermediate in 4-hydroxypyridine metabolism by an Agrobacterium sp (N.C.I.B."
683,"10413), was converted by extracts into 1mol of pyruvate, 2mol of formate and 1mol of NH(3) at pH7.0."
684,2
685,"Formate, but not the alternative likely product formamide, was further oxidized fivefold faster by 4-hydroxypyridine-grown washed cells than by similar organisms grown on succinate."
686,3
687,"The oxidation of pyridine-3,4-diol by crude extracts at pH8.5 required 1mol of O(2)/mol of substrate, produced 1mol of acid and led to the formation of formate and a new compound with an extinction maximum of 285nm (Compound I)."
688,"This step was believed to be mediated by a new labile dioxygenase (t((1/2))=4h at pH7.0, 4 degrees C) cleaving the pyridine ring between C-2 and C-3."
689,4
690,"Many of the properties of this pyridine-3,4-diol dioxygenase paralleled those of the extradiol (;meta\') oxygenases of aromatic-ring cleavage."
691,The extreme lability of the enzyme has so far precluded extensive purification.
692,5
693,"Compound I showed changes in the u.v.-absorption spectrum with pH but after acidification it was converted into a new product, 3-formylpyruvate, with an extinction maximum now at 279nm."
694,6
695,Both Compound I and 3-formylpyruvate were metabolized by extracts but at very different rates.
696,"The slower rate of metabolism of Compound I was nevertheless consistent with that of pyridine-3,4-diol metabolism."
697,7
698,On acidification Compound I released about 0.65mol of NH(3) and has been identified as 3-formiminopyruvate.
699,8
700,3-Formylpyruvate was hydrolysed to formate and pyruvate (K(m) 2mum) by an acylpyruvate hydrolase active against several other dioxo homologues.
701,"The activity of this enzyme was much lower in extracts of succinate-grown cells.An inducible acetylesterase (EC 3.1.1.6) that hydrolyzes ethyl acetate, an intermediate in the degradation of 2-butanone by Nocardia strain LSU-169, was purified."
702,"The polypeptide molecular weight as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 39,500, and the enzyme molecular weight determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation was 84,000."
703,The purified enzyme demonstrated aggregation in polyacrylamide gels.
704,"The esterase hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl acetate, ethyl acetate, and methyl acetate; however, enzymatic hydrolysis of phosphates, sulfates, dipeptides, lactones, or the ethyl esters of N-benzoyl-l-tyrosine could not be detected."
705,"The apparent K(m) for esterase activity with p-nitrophenyl acetate as the substrate was 6.7 x 10(-5) M, and the maximal velocity (V) was 1,223 mumol/min per mg of protein at 30 C. With ethyl acetate as the substrate, the apparent K(m) was 3.6 x 10(-4) M and V was 1,026 mumol/min per mg of protein."
706,"No significant inhibition of esterase activity was obtained with organophosphates, mercuric compounds, eserine sulfate, sodium arsanilate, NaF, CaCl(2), CoCl(2), or MnCl(2)."
707,"At concentrations from 7 x 10(-4) to 4 x 10(-3) M, 2-butanol and primary alcohols with chain lengths of four or more carbons inhibited esterase activity from 59 to 86%."
708,Linear noncompetitive inhibition of esterase activity by 3-methyl-1-butanol with a K(i) of 1.0 x 10(-3) M was demonstrated.1.
709,Several species of micro-organisms that were capable of utilizing pyridine compounds as carbon and energy source were isolated from soil and sewage.
710,Compounds degraded included pyridine and the three isomeric hydroxypyridines.
711,2
712,"Suitable modifications of the cultural conditions led to the accumulation of pyridinediols (dihydroxypyridines), which were isolated and characterized."
713,3
714,"Three species of Achromobacter produced pyridine-2,5-diol from 2- or 3-hydroxypyridine whereas an uncommon Agrobacterium sp."
715,(N.C.I.B.
716,"10413) produced pyridine-3,4-diol from 4-hydroxypyridine."
717,4
718,"On the basis of chemical isolation, induction of the necessary enzymes in washed suspensions and the substrate specificity exhibited by the isolated bacteria, the initial transformations proposed are: 2-hydroxypyridine --> pyridine-2,5-diol; 3-hydroxypyridine --> pyridine-2,5-diol and 4-hydroxypyridine --> pyridine-3,4-diol."
719,5
720,"A selected pyridine-utilizer, Nocardia Z1, did not produce any detectable hydroxy derivative from pyridine, but carried out a slow oxidation of 3-hydroxypyridine to pyridine-2,3-diol and pyridine-3,4-diol."
721,These diols were not further metabolized.
722,6
723,"Addition of the isomeric hydroxypyridines to a model hydroxylating system resulted in the formation of those diols predicted by theory.Pseudomonas putida 39/D oxidized p-xylene to cis-3,6-dimethyl-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,2-diol (cis-p-xylene dihydrodiol)."
724,The latter compound was isolated in crystalline form and its physical properties were determined.
725,"The cis configuration of the hydroxyl groups in the oxidation product was inferred from its ability to form an isopropylidene derivative with 2,2-dimethoxypropane."
726,"Acid treatment of cis-p-xylene dihydrodiol resulted in the formation of 2,5-dimethylphenol."
727,"A partially purified preparation of cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase oxidized cis-p-xylene dihydrodiol to 1,2-dihydroxy-3,6-dimethylbenzene (3,6-dimethylpyrocatechol)."
728,"P. putida 39/D oxidized m-xylene to a compound whose spectral and chromatographic characteristics were consistent with the structure 3,5-dimethyl-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,2-diol."
729,"This product was very unstable, and all attempts to isolate it led to the formation of 2,4-dimethylphenol.A Beijerinckia sp."
730,"and a mutant strain, Beijerinckia sp."
731,"strain B8/36, were shown to cooxidize the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons acenaphthene and acenaphthylene."
732,"Both organisms oxidized acenaphthene to the same spectrum of metabolites, which included 1-acenaphthenol, 1-acenaphthenone, 1,2-acenaphthenediol, acenaphthenequinone, and a compound that was tentatively identified as 1,2-dihydroxyacenaphthylene."
733,"In contrast, acenaphthylene was oxidized to acenaphthenequinone and the compound tentatively identified as 1,2-dihydroxyacenaphthylene by the wild-type strain of Beijerinckia."
734,"Both of these products were also formed when the organism was incubated with synthetic cis-1,2-acenaphthenediol."
735,"A metabolite identified as cis-1,2-acenaphthenediol was formed from acenaphthylene by the mutant Beijerinckia sp."
736,strain B8/36.
737,Cell extracts prepared from the wild-type Beijerinckia strain contain a constitutive pyridine nucleotide-dependent dehydrogenase which can oxidize 1-acenaphthenol and 9-fluorenol.
738,"The results indicate that although acenaphthene and acenaphthylene are both oxidized to acenaphthenequinone, the pathways leading to the formation of this end product are different.A Nocardia rhodochrous strain capable of utilizing acetylene as its sole source of carbon and energy exhibited slow growth on low concentrations of acetaldehyde."
739,"Resting cells incubated with acetylene formed a product identified as acetaldehyde, but attempts to demonstrate acetylene hydrase activity in cell-free extracts were unsuccessful."
740,"Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in N. rhodochrous was found to be NAD+ linked and nonacylating, converting acetaldehyde to acetate."
741,"Specific activities of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, acetothiokinase, and isocitrate lyase were enhanced in cells grown on acetylene and ethanol as compared with cells grown on alternate substrates."
742,"These results suggest that acetylene is catabolized via acetaldehyde to acetate and eventually to acetyl coenzyme A. Acetylene oxidation in N. rhodochrous appears to be constitutive and is not inhibited in the presence of either ethylene, nitrous oxide, or methane.The oxidation of thiobenzamide (TB) and its S-oxide (TBSO) has been investigated using rat liver microsomes."
743,"In the presence of O2 and NADPH, TB is rapidly converted to TBSO plus small amounts of benzamide (BA) by rat liver microsomes; neither benzonitrile nor other metabolites were detected."
744,"Under similar conditions, TBSO is converted solely to BA."
745,"Studies with metabolic inhibitors and inducing agents indicated that both the S-oxidation of TB and its further conversion to BA, probably via enzymatic oxidation to TBSO2 (a chemically reactive sulfene), are catalyzed mainly by the microsomal FAD-containing monooxygenase."
746,"No clear evidence for the involvement of cytochromes P-450 was obtained, but neither could this possibility be excluded."
747,The overall pathway for biotransformation of TB in vitro can be represented as: TB leads to TBSO leads to  leads to BA.
748,The possible role of TBSO and TBSO2 in the in vivo hepatotoxicity of TB and TBSO are discussed in light of their chemical reactivities.The nylon oligomer (6-aminohexanoic acid cyclic dimer) degradation genes on plasmid pOAD2 of Flavobacterium sp.
749,KI72 were cloned into Escherichia coli vector pBR322.
750,"The locus of one of the genes, the structural gene of 6-aminohexanoic acid linear oligomer hydrolase, was determined by constructing various deletion plasmids and inserting the lacUV5 promoter fragment of E. coli into the deletion plasmid."
751,Two kinds of repeated sequences (RS-I and RS-II) were detected on pOAD2 by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments.
752,These repeated sequences appeared five times (RS-I) or twice (RS-II) on pOAD2.
753,One of the RS-II regions and the structural gene of the hydrolase overlapped.A fragment of plasmid NAH7 from Pseudomonas putida PpG7 has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli HB101.
754,Growth of the recombinant Escherichia coli in nutrient medium results in the formation of indigo.
755,The production of this dye is increased in the presence of tryptophan or indole.
756,Several bacteria that oxidize aromatic hydrocarbons to cis-dihydrodiols also oxidize indole to indigo.
757,"The results suggest that indigo formation is due to the combined activities of tryptophanase and naphthalene dioxygenase.The s-triazine cyclopropylmelamine (N-cyclopropyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine) was degraded to about 6 mol of NH4+/mol of substrate by a mixture of two bacteria (strains A and D, both Pseudomonas spp.)"
758,Only strain A grew with cyclopropylmelamine as sole and limiting source of nitrogen.
759,The organism obtained 2 mol of nitrogen/mol of substrate and excreted a product that was identified as cyclopropylammelide .
760,Proteins in extracts from strain A were separated on a Sephadex G-200 column.
761,"Cyclopropylmelamine was found to be deaminated in two separable steps to cyclopropylammelide via cyclopropylammeline , which was identified."
762,"Strain D could not utilize cyclopropylmelamine or cyclopropylammeline, but could utilize cyclopropylammelide (or homologue) as sole and limiting source of nitrogen and obtain about 4 mol of nitrogen/mol of substrate."
763,Proteins in cell extracts from strain D were separated on a DEAE-cellulose column.
764,Alkylammelides were degraded quantitatively by one enzyme fraction to 1 mol of cyanuric acid plus 1 mol of alkylamine/mol of substrate.
765,The specific activities of enzymes in extracts of the two strains were as high as the activities observed during growth.
766,The three activities studied in the two strains were all active under aerobic and oxygen-free conditions.
767,"The reactions appear to be hydrolytic, yielding 2 mol of NH4+ plus 1 mol of cyclopropylamine and 1 mol of cyanuric acid/mol of substrate.The fungus Cunninghamella elegans oxidized anthracene and phenanthrene to form predominately trans-dihydrodiols."
768,The metabolites were isolated by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography for structural and conformational analyses.
769,"Comparison of the circular dichroism spectrum of the fungal trans-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydroanthracene to that formed by rat liver microsomes indicated that the major enantiomer of the trans-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydroanthracene formed by C. elegans had an S,S absolute stereochemistry, which is opposite to the predominately 1R,2R dihydrodiol formed by rat liver microsomes."
770,"C. elegans oxidized phenanthrene primarily in the 1,2-positions to form trans-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydrophenanthrene."
771,"In addition, a minor amount of trans-3,4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrophenanthrene was detected."
772,"Metabolism at the K-region (9,10-positions) of phenanthrene was not detected."
773,"Comparison of the circular dichroism spectra of the phenanthrene trans-1,2- and trans-3,4-dihydrodiols formed by C. elegans to those formed by mammalian enzymes indicated that each of the dihydrodiols formed by C. elegans had an S,S absolute configuration."
774,The results indicate that there are differences in both the regio- and stereoselective metabolism of anthracene and phenanthrene between the fungus C. elegans and rat liver microsomes.The suitability of dimethyl ether as a C1 compound was examined with the obligate methylobacterium Methylococcus capsulatus (Texas).
775,The ether did not support growth and was not formed during growth on methane; it was an inhibitor of growth and oxidation of methane and a poor oxidation substrate for cell suspensions.
776,"NADH stimulation of methane, but not dimethyl ether, oxidation occurred in cell extracts.Previously, Pseudomonas putida was shown to degrade (+)-camphor, and cleavage of the first ring of the bicyclic structure involved two monooxygenases (a hydroxylase and a ring oxygen-inserting enzyme), a dehydrogenase, and spontaneous cleavage of an unstable oxygenation product (lactone)."
777,"Cleavage of the second ring was not demonstrated but was assumed also to occur by ring oxygen insertion, since the predicted oxygenation product was extracted from whole-cell incubation systems."
778,"Our investigation established that metabolism of the first ring cleavage intermediate, 2-oxo-delta 3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetic acid, occurred through the sequential action of two inducible enzymes, a coenzyme A ester synthetase and an oxygenase."
779,"The oxygenase was purified to homogeneity and had a molecular weight of 106,000."
780,This enzyme carried a single molecule of flavin adenine dinucleotide and consisted of two identical subunits.
781,Iron was not present at a significant level.
782,"The oxygenase was specific for NADPH as the electron donor and absolutely specific for the coenzyme A ester of 2-oxo-delta 3-4,5,5-trimethylcyclopentenylacetic acid as the substrate."
783,"The reaction stoichiometry was compatible with this enzyme being a monooxygenase, and a mass spectral analysis of the methyl ester of the product confirmed the insertion of a single oxygen atom."
784,"The enzyme appeared to be analogous to, although distinct from."
785,"2,5-diketocamphane 1,2-monooxygenase in catalyzing a ""biological Baeyer-Villiger"" reaction with the formation of a lactone."
786,"Structural analogy suggested that this lactone, like the first, was also unstable and susceptible to spontaneous ring opening, although this was not experimentally established.The initiation of patulin biosynthesis in submerged batch cultures of Penicillium urticae NRRL 2159A was investigated at the enzyme level."
787,"In contrast to earlier studies, this study achieved a clear temporal separation of growing cells devoid of secondary metabolism-specific enzymes from nongrowing cells, which rapidly produce these enzymes."
788,"A spore inoculum, silicone-treated flasks, and two new media which supported a rapid, pellet-free, filamentous type of growth were used."
789,"In yeast extract-glucose-buffer medium, a marked drop in the specific growth rate (approximately equal to 0.26 h-1) coincided with the appearance of the first pathway-specific enzyme, 6-methylsalicylic acid synthetase, at about 19 h after inoculation."
790,"About 3 h later, when replicatory growth had ceased entirely, the sparsely branched mycelia (length, approximately equal to 550 microns) began the rapid synthesis of a later pathway enzyme, m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase."
791,"A similar sequence of events occurred in a defined nitrate-glucose-buffer medium; 12 other strains or isolates of P. urticae, as well as some patulin-producing aspergilli, behaved in a similar manner."
792,The age at which a culture produced m-hydroxybenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase was increased by increasing the nutrient nitrogen content of the medium or by decreasing the size of the spore inoculum.
793,In each instance the appearance of enzyme was determined by the nutritional status of the culture and not by its age.
794,A similar appearance of patulin pathway enzymes occurred when a growing culture was resuspended in a nitrogen-free 4% glucose solution with or without 0.1 M phosphate (pH 6.5).
795,The appearance of both the synthetase and the dehydrogenase was arrested by the addition of cycloheximide (0.4 to 5 micrograms/ml) or actinomycin D (20 to 80 micrograms/ml).
796,"This requirement for de novo protein and ribonucleic acid syntheses was confirmed by the incorporation of labeled leucine into the dehydrogenase, and the possibility that latent or preformed proteins were being activated was eliminated.Constitutive synthesis of enzymes responsible for methyl group oxidation in 3,5-xylenol degradation and an associated p-cresol methylhydroxylase in Pseudomonas putida NCIB 9869 was shown by their retention at high specific activities in cells transferred from 3,5-xylenol medium to glutamate medium."
797,"The specific activities of other enzymes of the 3,5-xylenol pathway declined upon removal of aromatic substrate, consistent with their inducible control."
798,"Specific activities of the methyl-oxidizing enzymes showed an eventual decline concomitant with a decrease in the fraction of bacteria capable of growth with 3,5-xylenol; a simultaneous loss of the ability to grow with m-hydroxybenzoate was also observed."
799,"The property of 3,5-xylenol utilization could be transferred to another strain of P. putida."
800,"It is proposed that enzymes of the 3,5-xylenol pathway and those for conversion of p-cresol to p-hydroxybenzoate are plasmid encoded, that the early methyl-oxidizing enzymes are expressed constitutively, and that the later enzymes are inducible.The degradation of  - cis, trans-permethrin was studied in Dubbs fine sandy loam soil incubated at 10, 25, and 40 degrees C from 0 to 64 days."
801,"The most rapid degradation of permethrin to  - cis, trans -3- (2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid (DCVA) and ultimately 14CO2 occurred at 25 degrees C. Rapid degradation to DCVA also occurred at 40 degrees C, however, further degradation of DCVA to 14CO2 was reduced."
802,Permethrin degradation to 14CO2 was slowest at 10 degrees C. The degradation rate of trans-permethrin was greater than the cis-permethrin at all temperatures tested.
803,"The halflives of cis- and trans-permethrin were 55 and 14 days at 10 degrees C, 12 and 5 days at 25 degrees C, and 27 and 4 days at 40 degrees C, respectively."
804,"Compounds identified from treated soil were the original -cis, trans-permethrin and the major degradation products cis-, and trans-DCVA.Dominant lethal studies were conducted in SD male rats with 5 halogenated 3-carbon compounds that are structurally similar to a known mutagen 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP)."
805,"1,2,3-Tribromopropane induced dominant lethal mutation especially in the early spermatid stage."
806,This finding was almost the same as that obtained after DBCP treatment.
807,"The estimated dominant lethal mutation index of a group treated with 1,2-dibromopropane was marginal at week 1 of testing."
808,"On the other hand, bromopropane, 1,2,3-trichloropropane and 1-chloropropane produced negative responses for induction of dominant lethals.Several strains of Micrococcus have been isolated by enrichment with one of several phthalate esters as sole carbon source."
809,They have been separated into four groups by their esterase content and nutritional characteristics.
810,The catabolic potential for phthalate utilization found in these strains provides further support for designation of the four groups.
811,"Pathways for phthalate utilization by 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate and/or 3,4-dihydroxyphthalate and protocatechuate and/or 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate are outlined, which suggests that micrococci possess substantial potential for the catabolism of aromatic compounds.The presence of naturally occurring volatile halohydrocarbons in marine organisms, seawater, and the upper atmosphere has prompted a serach for their biosynthetic origin."
812,"An earlier report documented the preparation of an enzyme extract from a marine algae which catalyzed the formation of dibromomethane, tribromomethane, and 1-bromopentane from 3-oxooctanoic acid."
813,"This report did not establish a pathway nor did it examine potential intermediates involved in the synthesis of the halometabolites (Theiler, R., Cook, J., Hager, L., & Siuda, J."
814,"(1978) Science (Washington, D.C.) 202, 1094-1096)."
815,"This paper shows that an extract of the green marine algae, Penicillus capitatus, which contains a potent bromoperoxidase activity, is capable of catalyzing the incorporation of bromide ion into organic combination in the presence of 3-oxooctanoic acid."
816,"By use of gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy, it has been possible to identify tribromomethane, 1-bromo-2-heptanone, 1,1-dibromo-2-heptanone, and 1,1,1-tribromo-2-heptanone as products of this reaction."
817,The properties of the enzymatically synthesized products have been compared to authentic compounds and found to be identical.
818,"The mono- and dibromoheptanones can be utilized as precursors for the enzymatic formation of tribromoheptanone, but the final hydrolysis of the tribromoheptanone to bromoform appears to be a nonenzymatic reaction with the P. capitatus extracts.Trimethylarsine oxide, a probable intermediate in the biological transformation of arsenate, was reduced to volatile trimethylarsine by Candida humicola."
819,A simple assay for the rate of trimethylarsine production from trimethylarsine oxide by the fungus was developed.
820,"The optimum pH for the reduction was determined as 5.1-5.2, and the optimum temperature was 40 degrees C. The rate of reduction was directly proportional to cell concentration and followed Michaelis-Menten type kinetics."
821,There was almost no trimethylarsine produced by heated or broken cells.
822,"The reaction was inhibited by a number of electron transport inhibitors and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation including cyanide, azide, and 2,4-dinitrophenol."
823,"The rate of reduction was modified by arsenate, methylarsonate, dimethylarsinate, selenate, and tellurate."
824,Preincubation of cells with trimethylarsine oxide increased the rate of reduction 69-fold; this increase in activity was blocked if the cells were incubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide.The enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACPC deaminase) from a pseudomonad is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) linked catalyst which fragments the cyclopropane substrate to alpha-ketobutyrate and ammonia .
825,Enzymatic incubations in D2O yield alpha-ketobutyrate with one deuterium at the C-4 methyl group and one deuterium at one of the C-3 prochiral methylene hydrogens.
826,Stereochemical analysis of the location of the C-3 deuteron was accomplished by in situ enzymatic reduction to (2S)-2-hydroxybutyrate with L-lactate dehydrogenase and conversion to the phenacyl ester.
827,The C-3 hydrogens of the (2S)-2-hydroxybutyryl moiety are fully resolved in a 250-MHz NMR spectrum.
828,"Absolute assignment of 3S and 3R loci was obtained with phenacyl (2S,3S)-2-hydroxybutyrate generated enzymatically by D-serine dehydratase action on D-threonine."
829,ACPC deaminase shows a stereoselective outcome with a 3R:3S deuterated product ratio of 72:28.
830,2-Vinyl-ACPC is also a fragmentation substrate with exclusive regiospecific cleavage to yield the straight-chain keto acid product 2-keto-5-hexenoate.
831,"The D isomer of vinylglycine is processed to alpha-ketobutyrate and ammonia at 8% the Vmax of ACPC, while L-vinylglycine is not a substrate."
832,It is likely that ACPC and D-vinylglycine yield a common intermediate--the vinylglycine-PLP-p-quinoid adduct--which is then protonated sequentially at C-4 and then C-3 to account for the observed deuterium incorporation.
833,"The D isomers of beta-substituted alanines (fluoroalanine, chloroalanine, and O-acetyl-D-serine) partition between catalytic elimination and enzyme inactivation."
834,"Each shows a different partition ratio, arguing against the common aminoacrylyl-PLP as the inactivating species.Higher than normal levels of organic fluorine were found in the blood of workers exposed to fluorochemicals in an industrial environment."
835,No ill health effects attributable to exposure to fluorochemicals were found among these workers.
836,The ambient air in the process operation areas in the plant was found to contain measurable amounts of organic fluorine.
837,Through certain modifications in the process steps and improvements in engineering controls.
838,A substantial reduction in the airborne fluorochemical levels within the plant was achieved.Pseudomonas cepacia F297 grew with fluorene as a sole source of carbon and energy; its growth yield corresponded to an assimilation of about 40% of fluorene carbon.
839,The accumulation of a ring meta-cleavage product during growth and the identification of 1-indanone in growth media and washed-cell suspensions suggest that strain F297 metabolizes fluorene by mechanisms analogous to those of naphthalene degradation.
840,"In addition to fluorene, strain F297 utilized for growth a wide variety of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), including naphthalene, 2,3-dimethylnaphthalene, phenanthrene, anthracene, and dibenzothiophene."
841,"Fluorene-induced cells of the strain also transformed 2,6-dimethylnaphthalene, biphenyl, dibenzofuran, acenaphthene, and acenaphthylene."
842,"The identification of products formed from those substrates (by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) in washed-cell suspensions indicates that P. cepacia F297 carries out the following reactions: (i) aromatic ring oxidation and cleavage, apparently using the pyruvate released for growth, (ii) methyl group oxidations, (iii) methylenic oxidations, and (iv) S oxidations of aromatic sulfur heterocycles."
843,"Strain F297 grew with a creosote-PAC mixture, producing an almost complete removal of all aromatic compounds containing 2 to 3 rings in 14 days, as demonstrated by gas chromatography analysis of the remaining PACs recovered from cultures."
844,The identification of key chemicals confirmed that not only are certain compounds depleted but also the anticipated reaction products are found.A study was conducted to determine whether competition for inorganic nutrients affects the biodegradation of mixtures of substrates.
845,"Little benzylamine was mineralized by Pseudomonas putida in solutions with no added P, but the substrate was degraded if the medium contained 100 nM P. The enhancement by P addition did not occur if the medium also contained caprolactam and a caprolactam-utilizing strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa."
846,The suppression by the second bacterium was overcome by a higher P concentration.
847,"The rate of caprolactam utilization by P. aeruginosa was reduced if benzylamine and P. putida were also present in media with 100 nM P, but the suppression was absent if the solution contained a higher P concentration."
848,Glutamate increased and inorganic N plus P decreased the length of the acclimation phase prior to benzylamine mineralization in lake water.
849,We suggest that the effect of one biodegradable substrate on the metabolism of a second often results from a competition for inorganic nutrients.Many Pseudomonads are able to use linear alkanes as sole carbon and energy source.
850,"The genetics and enzymology of alkane metabolism have been investigated in depth for Pseudomonas oleovorans, which is able to oxidize C5-C12 n-alkanes by virtue of two gene regions, localized on the OCT-plasmid."
851,"The so-called alk-genes have been cloned in pLAFR1, and were subsequent analyzed using minicell expression experiments, DNA sequencing and deletion analysis."
852,This has led to the identification and characterization of of the alkBFGHJKL and alkST genes which encode all proteins necessary to convert alkanes to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives.
853,"These then enter the beta-oxidation-cycle, and can be utilized as carbon- and energy sources."
854,"Medium (C6-C12)- or long-chain (C13-C20) n-alkanes can be utilized by many strains, some of which have been partially characterized."
855,The alkane-oxidizing enzymes used by some of these strains (e.g.
856,"two P. aeruginosa strains, a P. denitrificans strain and a marine Pseudomonas sp.)"
857,"appear to be closely related to those encoded by the OCT-plasmid.New antibiotics were isolated from the culture broth of the myxobacterium, Sorangium cellulosum, strain So ce 678."
858,The antibiotics were active against Gram-positive bacteria and mammalian cells.
859,They were named tartrolon A and B. Tartrolon B contains a boron atom.
860,The boron binding region of tartrolon is identical with that of boromycin and aplasmomycin.Biodegradation is increasingly being considered as a less expensive alternative to physical and chemical means of decomposing organic pollutants.
861,"Pathways of biodegradation have been characterized for a number of heterotrophic microorganisms, mostly soil isolates, some of which have been used for remediation of water."
862,"Because cyanobacteria are photoautotrophic and some can fix atmospheric nitrogen, their use for bioremediation of surface waters would circumvent the need to supply biodegradative heterotrophs with organic nutrients."
863,"This paper demonstrates that two filamentous cyanobacteria have a natural ability to degrade a highly chlorinated aliphatic pesticide, lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane); presents quantitative evidence that this ability can be enhanced by genetic engineering; and provides qualitative evidence that those two strains can be genetically engineered to degrade another chlorinated pollutant, 4-chlorobenzoate.Burkholderia cepacia AC1100 utilizes 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) as a sole source of carbon and energy."
864,"PT88 is a chromosomal deletion mutant of B. cepacia AC1100 and is unable to grow on 2,4,5-T."
865,"The nucleotide sequence of a 5.5-kb chromosomal fragment from B. cepacia AC1100 which complemented PT88 for growth on 2,4,5-T was determined."
866,"The sequence revealed the presence of six open reading frames, designated ORF1 to ORF6."
867,"Five polypeptides were produced when this DNA region was under control of the T7 promoter in Escherichia coli; however, no polypeptide was produced from the fourth open reading frame, ORF4."
868,"Homology searches of protein sequence databases were performed to determine if the proteins involved in 2,4,5-T metabolism were similar to other biodegradative enzymes."
869,"In addition, complementation studies were used to determine which genes were essential for the metabolism of 2,4,5-T."
870,"The first gene of the cluster, ORF1, encoded a 37-kDa polypeptide which was essential for complementation of PT88 and showed significant homology to putative trans-chlorodienelactone isomerases."
871,"The next gene, ORF2, was necessary for complementation and encoded a 47-kDa protein which showed homology to glutathione reductases."
872,"ORF3 was not essential for complementation; however, both the 23-kDa protein encoded by ORF3 and the predicted amino acid sequence of ORF4 showed homology to glutathione S-transferases."
873,"ORF5, which encoded an 11-kDa polypeptide, was essential for growth on 2,4,5-T, but the amino acid sequence did not show homology to those of any known proteins."
874,"The last gene of the cluster, ORF6, was necessary for complementation of PT88, and the 32-kDa protein encoded by this gene showed homology to catechol and chlorocatechol-1,2-dioxygenases.Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia PR1(23) has been shown to constitutively express to toluene catabolic pathway distinguished by a unique toluene ortho-monooxygenase (Tom)."
875,This strain has also been shown to contain two extrachromosomal elements of < 70 and > 100 kb.
876,"A derivative strain cured of the largest plasmid, PR1(23) Cure, was unable to grow on phenol or toluene as the sole source of carbon and energy, which requires expression of the Tom pathway."
877,Transfer of the larger plasmid from strain G4 (the parent strain inducible for Tom) enabled PR1(23) Cure to grow on toluene or phenol via inducible Tom pathway expression.
878,Conjugal transfer of TOM23c from PR1(23) to an antibiotic-resistant derivative of PR1(23) Cure enabled the transconjugant to grow with either phenol or toluene as the sole source of carbon and energy through constitutive expression of the Tom pathway.

1063,"The (R)-3-hydroxy-1-indanone was formed in 62% enantiomeric excess (ee) (R:S, 81:19), while the 2-hydroxy-1-indanone was racemic."
1064,The same cells also formed 2-hydroxy-1-indanone from 2-indanone.
1065,Purified NDO components oxidized 1-indanone and 2-indanone to the same products produced by strain 9816/11.
1066,"P. putida F39/D cells, expressing TDO, oxidized 2-indanone to (S)-2-hydroxy-1-indanone of 76% ee (R:S, 12:88) but did not oxidize 1-indanone efficiently."
1067,"Purified TDO components also oxidized 2-indanone to (S)-2-hydroxy-1-indanone of 90% ee (R:S, 5:95) and failed to oxidize 1-indanone."
1068,Oxidation of 1- and 2-indanone in the presence of oxygen indicated that the hydroxyindanones were formed by the incorporation of a single atom of molecular oxygen (monooxygenation) rather than by the dioxygenation of enol tautomers of the ketone substrates.
1069,"As alternatives to chemical synthesis, these biotransformations represent direct routes to 3-hydroxy-1-indanone and 2-hydroxy-1-indanone as the major products from 1-indanone and 2-indanone, respectively.The enzymes involved in the microbial metabolism of many important phosphorus- or sulfur-containing xenobiotics, including organophosphate insecticides and precursors to organosulfate and organosulfonate detergents and dyestuffs have been characterized."
1070,In several instances their genes have been cloned and analysed.
1071,"For phosphonate xenobiotics, the enzyme system responsible for the cleavage of the carbon-phosphorus bond has not yet been observed in vitro, though much is understood on a genetic level about phosphonate degradation."
1072,"Phosphonate metabolism is regulated as part of the Pho regulon, under phosphate starvation control."
1073,"For organophosphorothionate pesticides the situation is not so clear, and the mode of regulation appears to depend on whether the compounds are utilized to provide phosphorus, carbon or sulfur for cell growth."
1074,"The same is true for organosulfonate metabolism, where different (and differently regulated) enzymatic pathways are involved in the utilization of sulfonates as carbon and as sulfur sources, respectively."
1075,"Observations at the protein level in a number of bacteria suggest that a regulatory system is present which responds to sulfate limitation and controls the synthesis of proteins involved in providing sulfur to the cell and which may reveal analogies between the regulation of phosphorus and sulfur metabolism.Eight homoacetogenic strains of the genera Acetobacterium, Clostridium and Sporomusa were tested for their ability to dechlorinate tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethene, PCE)."
1076,Of the organisms tested only Sporomusa ovata was able to reductively dechlorinate PCE with methanol as an electron donor.
1077,Resting cells of S. ovata reductively dechlorinated PCE at a rate of 9.8 nmol h-1 (mg protein)-1 to trichloroethylene (TCE) as the sole product.
1078,The dechlorination activity depended on concomitant acetogenesis from methanol and CO2.
1079,"Cell-free extracts of S. ovata, Clostridium formicoaceticum, Acetobacterium woodii, and the methanogenic bacterium Methanolobus tindarius transformed PCE to TCE with Ti(III) or carbon monoxide as electron donors."
1080,Corrinoids were shown in S. ovata to be involved in the dechlorination reaction of PCE to TCE as evident from the reversible inhibition with propyl iodide.
1081,"Rates of dechlorination followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic.Seven bacterial isolates which degraded the herbicide metamitron (3-methyl-4-amino-6-phenyl-1,2,4-triazin-5-one) were obtained from field-enhanced soil by liquid enrichment culture."
1082,"All isolates appeared to be identical and a representative, 0246b, was identified as a Rhodococcus sp."
1083,by cell wall and fatty acid analyses.
1084,This isolate degraded metamitron as the sole source of carbon within 24 h at 25 degrees C and this is the first report of a bacterium capable of growing with metamitron as the sole source of carbon.
1085,Metamitron was degraded less rapidly when it was the sole source of both carbon and nitrogen.
1086,The rate and extent of degradation was affected by the presence and type of additional sources of carbon and nitrogen in the culture medium.
1087,In studies with -phenyl-labelled metamitron Rhodococcus sp.
1088,0246b partly mineralized the phenyl ring.2-Aminobenzenesulphonic acid (2AS) is degraded by Alcaligenes sp.
1089,strain O-1 via a previously detected but unidentified intermediate.
1090,"A mutant of strain O-1 was found to excrete this intermediate, which was isolated and identified by m.s., 1H- and 13C-n.m.r."
1091,as 3-sulphocatechol (3SC).
1092,Proteins from cell extracts of strain O-1 were separated by anion-exchange chromatography.
1093,"A multicomponent oxygenase was observed to convert 1 mol each of NADH, O2 and 2AS into 1 mol each of 3SC, NH3 and NAD+."
1094,"The enzyme presumably catalysed formation of the ring of a 2-amino-2,3-diol moiety, and elimination in the amino group led to a rearomatization."
1095,"3SC was further degraded via meta ring cleavage, which could be prevented by inactivation of the 3-sulphocatechol-2,3-dioxygenase (3SC23O) with 3-chlorocatechol."
1096,"In Tris buffer, the separated 3SC23O catalysed the reaction of 1 mol each of 3SC and O2 involving a transient yellow intermediate, and release of 1 mol of sulphite and two organic products."
1097,The major product was identified by n.m.r.
1098,and by g.c./m.s.
1099,"as 5-carboxypenta-2,4-dien-5-olide (CPDO), an indicator of formation of 2-hydroxymuconic acid (2HM)."
1100,"The second product was identified as the Z,E isomer of 2HM by comparison with authentic material."
1101,"When the CPDO in the product mixture was chemically hydrolysed to (Z,E)-2HM, 1 mol of (Z,E)-2HM/mol of 3SC was observed."
1102,"If oxygenation of 3SC by 3SC23O was carried out in phosphate buffer, only a single product was detected, a keto form of 2HM."
1103,"This dioate was also formed from authentic (Z,E)-2HM in phosphate buffer."
1104,"Formation of the natural product (Z,E)-2HM from the xenobiotic, 3SC, seems to involve oxygenation to the unstable 2-hydroxy-6-sulphonomuconic acid semialdehyde, which hydrolyses spontaneously to 2HM."
1105,"There would appear to be at least one spontaneous reaction per enzyme reaction in this pathway.Rhodococcus rhodochrous NCIMB 13259 grows on styrene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and benzene as sole carbon sources."
1106,"Simultaneous induction tests with cells grown on styrene or toluene showed high rates of oxygen consumption with toluene cis-glycol and 3-methylcatechol, suggesting the involvement of a cis-glycol pathway."
1107,3-Vinylcatechol accumulated when intact cells were incubated with styrene in the presence of 3-fluorocatechol to inhibit catechol dioxygenase activity.
1108,Experiments with 18O2 showed that 3-vinylcatechol was produced following a dioxygenase ring attack.
1109,"Extracts contained a NAD-dependent cis-glycol dehydrogenase, which converted styrene cis-glycol to 3-vinylcatechol."
1110,"Both catechol 1,2- and 2,3-dioxygenase activities were present, and these were separated from each other and from the activities of cis-glycol dehydrogenase and 2-hydroxymuconic acid semialdehyde hydrolase by ion-exchange chromatography of extracts."
1111,"2-Vinylmuconate accumulated in the growth medium when cells were grown on styrene, apparently as a dead-end product, and extracts contained no detectable muconate cycloisomerase activity."
1112,"3-Vinylcatechol was cleaved by catechol 2,3-dioxygenase to give a yellow compound, tentatively identified as 2-hydroxy-6-oxoocta-2,4,7-trienoic acid, and the action of 2-hydroxymuconic acid semialdehyde hydrolase on this produced acrylic acid."
1113,"A compound with the spectral characteristics of 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate was produced by the action of 2-hydroxymuconic acid semialdehyde hydrolase on the 2,3-cleavage product of 3-methylcatechol."
1114,"Extracts were able to transform 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate and 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate into acetaldehyde and pyruvate."
1115,"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)Pseudomonas putida CSV86, a soil bacterium, grows on 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene as the sole source of carbon and energy."
1116,"In order to deduce the pathways for the biodegradation of 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene, metabolites were isolated from the spent medium and purified by thin layer chromatography."
1117,"Emphasis has been placed on the structural characterisation of isolated intermediates by GC-MS, demonstration of enzyme activities in the cell free extracts and measurement of oxygen uptake by whole cells in the presence of various probable metabolic intermediates."
1118,The data obtained from such a study suggest the possibility of occurrence of multiple pathways in the degradation of 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene.
1119,"We propose that, in one of the pathways, the aromatic ring adjacent to the one bearing the methyl moiety is oxidized leading to the formation of methylsalicylates and methylcatechols."
1120,In another pathway the methyl side chain is hydroxylated to -CH2-OH which is further converted to -CHO and -COOH resulting in the formation of naphthoic acid as the end product.
1121,"In addition to this, 2-hydroxymethylnaphthalene formed by the hydroxylation of the methyl group of 2-methylnaphthalene undergoes aromatic ring hydroxylation."
1122,The resultant dihydrodiol is further oxidised by a series of enzyme catalysed reactions to form 4-hydroxymethyl catechol as the end product of the pathway.The nucleotide sequence of the upstream region of the bphC gene from Pseudomonas sp.
1123,strain KKS102 was determined.
1124,Four genes were found in this region.
1125,"Deduced amino acid sequences of the first, second, third and fourth genes showed significant homology with a large subunit of iron-sulfur protein, a small subunit of iron-sulfur protein, ferredoxin and dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, respectively, from other bacteria which degrade biphenyl/polychlorinated biphenyls, toluene and benzene."
1126,"E. coli, in which the four genes, bphC and the gene for ferredoxin reductase from benzene degrading bacterium were expressed, was able to produce meta-cleavage compounds from chlorinated biphenyls."
1127,These results show that these gene products are functional in both biphenyl and polychlorinated biphenyls degradation.Alcaligenes sp.
1128,"strain O-1 utilizes three sulphonated aromatic compounds as sole sources of carbon and energy for growth in minimal salts medium-benzenesulphonate (BS), 4-toluenesulphonate (TS) and 2-aminobenzenesulphonate (2AS)."
1129,"The degradative pathway(s) in 2AS-grown cells are initiated with membrane transport, NADH-dependent dioxygenation and meta ring cleavage."
1130,The specific activity of the NADH-dependent dioxygenation(s) varied with the growth phase and was maximal near the end of exponential growth for each growth substrate.
1131,"Cells were harvested at this point from BS-, TS- and 2AS-salts medium."
1132,"Cells grown with each sulphonated substrate could oxygenate all three compounds, but only 2AS-grown cells consumed 2 mol O2 per mol 2AS or BS or TS."
1133,"BS- and TS-grown cells consumed 2 mol O2 per mol BS or TS but failed to oxygenate the product of oxygenation of 2AS, 3-sulphocatechol (3SC)."
1134,"These observations were repeated with cell extracts and we concluded that there were two sets of desulphonative pathways in the organism, one for 2AS and one for BS and TS."
1135,"We confirmed this hypothesis by separating the degradative enzymes from 2AS-, BS- or TS-grown cells."
1136,"A 2AS dioxygenase system and a 3SC-2,3-dioxygenase (3SC23O) were detected in 2AS-grown cells only."
1137,"In both BS- and TS-grown cells a dioxygenase system for BS and TS was observed as well as a principal catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (C23O-III), neither of which was present in 2AS-grown cells."
1138,"The 3SC23O was purified to near homogeneity, found to be monomeric (M(r) 42,000), and to catalyse 2,3-dioxygenation to a product that decayed spontaneously to sulphite and 2-hydroxymuconate."
1139,The 2AS dioxygenase system could cause not only deamination of 2AS but also desulphonation of BS and TS.
1140,The BS dioxygenase could desulphonate BS and apparently either desulphonate or deaminate 2AS.
1141,"Strain O-1 thus seems to contain two putative, independently regulated operons involving oxygenation and spontaneous desulphonation(s)."
1142,One operon encodes at least the 2AS dioxygenase system and 3SC23O whereas the other encodes at least the BS/TS dioxygenase system and C23O-III.The degradation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) by Moraxella and Pseudomonas spp.
1143,involves an initial monooxygenase-catalyzed removal of the nitro group.
1144,The resultant hydroquinone is subject to ring fission catalyzed by a dioxygenase enzyme.
1145,"We have isolated a strain of an Arthrobacter sp., JS443, capable of degrading PNP with stoichiometric release of nitrite."
1146,"During induction of the enzymes required for growth on PNP, 1,2,4-benzenetriol was identified as an intermediate by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) and radiotracer studies."
1147,"1,2,4-Benzenetriol was converted to maleylacetic acid, which was further degraded by the beta-ketoadipate pathway."
1148,"Conversion of PNP to 1,2,4-benzenetriol is catalyzed by a monooxygenase system in strain JS443 through the formation of 4-nitrocatechol, 4-nitroresorcinol, or both."
1149,Our results clearly indicate the existence of an alternative pathway for the biodegradation of PNP.Methyl fluoride and dimethyl ether were previously identified as inhibitors of ammonia oxidation and N2O production in autotrophic nitrifying bacteria.
1150,"We demonstrate that methyl fluoride and dimethyl ether are substrates for ammonia monooxygenase and are converted to formaldehyde and a mixture of methanol and formaldehyde, respectively.With triethanolamine as sole source of energy and organic carbon, a strictly anaerobic, gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium, strain LuTria 3, was isolated from sewage sludge and was assigned to the genus Acetobacterium on the basis of morphological and physiological properties."
1151,The G+C content of the DNA was 34.9 +/- 1.0 mol %.
1152,The new isolate fermented triethanolamine to acetate and ammonia.
1153,"In cell-free extracts, a triethanolamine-degrading enzyme activity was detected that formed acetaldehyde as reaction product."
1154,Triethanolamine cleavage was stimulated 30-fold by added adenosylcobalamin (co-enzyme B12) and inhibited by cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin.
1155,"Ethanolamine ammonia lyase, acetaldehyde:acceptor oxidoreductase, phosphate acetyltransferase, acetate kinase, and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase were measured in cell-free extracts of this strain."
1156,"Our results establish that triethanolamine is degraded by a corrinoid-dependent shifting of the terminal hydroxyl group to the subterminal carbon atom, analogous to a diol dehydratase reaction, to form an unstable intermediate that releases acetaldehyde."
1157,"No anaerobic degradation of triethylamine was observed in similar enrichment assays.Biotransformation of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) by Alcaligenes eutrophus A5 was demonstrated by analysis of ethyl acetate-extracted products from resting cell cultures."
1158,Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry characterization of the neutral extracts revealed two hydroxy-DDT intermediates (m/z = 370) with retention times at 19.55 and 19.80 min that shared identical mass spectra.
1159,This result suggested that the hydroxylations occurred at the ortho and meta positions on the aromatic ring.
1160,"UV-visible spectrum spectrophotometric analysis of a yellow metabolite in the culture supernatant showed a maximum A402 with, under acidic and basic conditions, spectrophotometric characteristics similar to those of the aromatic ring meta-cleavage products."
1161,4-Chlorobenzoic acid was detected by thin-layer chromatography radiochemical scanning in samples from mineralization experiments by comparison of Rf values of DDT intermediates with that of an authentic standard.
1162,These results were further confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.
1163,This study indicates that DDT appears to be oxidized by a dioxygenase in A. eutrophus A5 and that the products of this oxidation are subsequently subjected to ring fission to eventually yield 4-chlorobenzoic acid as a major stable intermediate.Bisphenol A (BPA) is metabolized by a Gram-negative aerobic bacterium via a novel pathway involving oxidative skeletal rearrangement of the BPA.
1164,"Oxidation of the aliphatic methyl group of BPA leads to coproduction of the methyl-hyroxylated 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol and a skeletally rearranged triol 1,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol."
1165,The major route of metabolism (> 80%) is through the rearrangement.
1166,"The 1,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-propanol is dehydrated to 4,4\'-dihydroxy-alpha-methylstilbene, which is rapidly cleaved by oxidation to 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 4-hydroxyacetophenone."
1167,4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde is oxidized to 4-hydroxybenzoic acid.
1168,Both 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-hydroxyacetophenone are mineralized.
1169,"The minor product of BPA hydroxylation, 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-propanol, is further oxidized to form both 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid and a skeletally rearranged tetraol, 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2-propanediol."
1170,"As is the case in the hydroxylation of BPA, the major product is skeletally rearranged."
1171,"2,3-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,2-propanediol is slowly transformed to 4-hydroxyphenacyl alcohol.A 25-kb DNA SalI fragment cloned from the chromosomal DNA of Pseudomonas putida OUS82, which utilizes phenanthrene (Phn+) and naphthalene (Nah+), carried all of the genes necessary for upper naphthalene catabolism."
1172,Cosmid recombinant pIP7 complemented both the Nah- and Phn- defects of OUS8211 (Trp-Nah-Phn-Sal+Hna+) and only the Phn- defect of OUS8212 (Trp-Nah-Phn-Sal-Hna+).
1173,The results indicate that strain OUS82 uses different pathways after o-hydroxycarboxylic aromatics in the catabolism of naphthalene and phenanthrene.Phenylacetic acid (PhAcOH) and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4HOPhAcOH) are catabolized in Pseudomonas putida U through two different pathways.
1174,"Mutation carried out with the transposon Tn5 has allowed the isolation of several mutants which, unlike the parental strain, are unable to grow in chemically defined medium containing either PhAcOH or 4HOPhAcOH as the sole carbon source."
1175,"Analysis of these strains showed that the ten mutants unable to grow in PhAcOH medium grew well in the one containing 4HOPhAcOH, whereas four mutants handicapped in the degradation of 4HOPhAcOH were all able to utilize PhAcOH."
1176,"These results show that the degradation of these two aromatic compounds in P. putida U is not carried out as formerly believed through a single linear and common pathway, but by two unrelated routes."
1177,"Identification of the blocked point in the catabolic pathway and analysis of the intermediate accumulated, showed that the mutants unable to utilize 4HOPhAcOH corresponded to two different groups: those blocked in the gene encoding 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid-3-hydroxylase; and those blocked in the gene encoding homoprotocatechuate-2,3-dioxygenase."
1178,"Mutants unable to use PhAcOH as the sole carbon source have been also classified into two different groups: those which contain a functional PhAc-CoA ligase protein; and those lacking this enzyme activity.Plasmid pRO1957, which contains a 26.5-kb fragment from the chromosome of Pseudomonas pickettii PKO1, allows P. aeruginosa PAO1 to grow on toluene or benzene as a sole carbon and energy source."
1179,"A subclone of pRO1957, designated pRO1966, when present in P. aeruginosa PAO1 grown in lactate-toluene medium, accumulates m-cresol in the medium, indicating that m-cresol is an intermediate of toluene catabolism."
1180,"Moreover, incubation of such cells in the presence of 18O2 followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of m-cresol extracts showed that the oxygen in m-cresol was derived from molecular oxygen."
1181,"Accordingly, this suggests that toluene-3-monooxygenation is the first step in the degradative pathway."
1182,Toluene-3-monooxygenase activity is positively regulated from a locus designated tbuT.
1183,"Induction of the toluene-3-monooxygenase is mediated by either toluene, benzene, ethylbenzene, or m-cresol."
1184,"Moreover, toluene-3-monooxygenase activity induced by these effectors also metabolizes benzene and ethylbenzene to phenol and 3-ethylphenol, respectively, and also after induction, o-xylene, m-xylene, and p-xylene are metabolized to 3,4-dimethylphenol, 2,4-dimethylphenol, and 2,5-dimethylphenol, respectively, although the xylene substrates are not effectors."
1185,"Styrene and phenylacetylene are transformed into more polar products.From a soil isolate, Pseudomonas strain C18, we cloned and sequenced a 9.8-kb DNA fragment that encodes dibenzothiophene-degrading enzymes."
1186,Nine open reading frames were identified and designated doxABDEFGHIJ.
1187,"Collectively, we refer to these genes as the DOX pathway."
1188,"At the nucleotide level, doxABD are identical to the ndoABC genes that encode naphthalene dioxygenase of Pseudomonas putida."
1189,"The DoxG protein is 97% identical to NahC (1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase) of P. putida."
1190,DoxE has 37% identity with cis-toluene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase.
1191,DoxF is similar to the aldehyde dehydrogenases of many organisms.
1192,The predicted DoxHIJ proteins have no obvious sequence similarities to known proteins.
1193,Gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector and mass spectroscopy confirmed that the DOX proteins convert naphthalene to salicylate and converting phenanthrene to 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid.
1194,"doxI mutants convert naphthalene to trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate, indicating that the DoxI protein is similar to NahE (trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate hydratase-aldolase)."
1195,Comparison of the DOX sequence with restriction maps of cloned naphthalene catabolic pathway (NAH) genes revealed many conserved restriction sites.
1196,"The DOX gene arrangement is identical to that proposed for NAH, except that the NAH equivalent of doxH has not been recognized."
1197,"DoxH may be involved in the conversion of 2-hydroxy-4-(2\'-oxo-3,5-cyclohexadienyl)-buta-2,4-dienoat e to cis-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate."
1198,doxJ encodes an enzyme similar to NahD (isomerase).
1199,"Our findings indicate that a single genetic pathway controls the metabolism of dibenzothiophene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene in strain C18 and that the DOX sequence encodes a complete upper naphthalene catabolic pathway similar to NAH.The Alcaligenes eutrophus 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate/alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase, encoded by the tfdA gene of plasmid pJP4, is an Fe(II)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate to 2,4-dichlorophenol and glyoxylate concomitant with the decomposition of alpha-ketoglutarate to form succinate and carbon dioxide (Fukumori, F., and Hausinger, R. P. (1993) J. Bacteriol."
1200,"175, 2083-2086)."
1201,"Using recombinant Escherichia coli cells that overexpress the tfdA gene, the thermolabile enzyme (stable only up to 30 degrees C) was purified to apparent homogeneity (specific activity of 16.9 mumol of substrate converted min-1 mg of protein-1) by a simple two-step procedure."
1202,"The native protein has an apparent M(r) of 50,000 +/- 2,500, consistent with a homodimeric structure."
1203,Ferrous ion is absolutely required for activity and cannot be replaced by several other divalent cations tested.
1204,Ascorbic acid stimulates dioxygenase activity and reduces the rate of enzyme inactivation by a metal ion-mediated process.
1205,"The enzyme exhibits maximum activity at pH 6.5-7, however, it is stable over a pH range of 6.5-11."
1206,"Although capable of hydroxylating a wide range of phenoxyacetates and related compounds, the enzyme exhibits the greatest affinity (Km 17.5 +/- 1.0 microM) and highest catalytic efficiency for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate."
1207,"Similarly, alpha-ketoglutarate is the preferred co-substrate (Km 3.20 +/- 0.54 microM) for the enzyme, but it can utilize a range of other alpha-ketoacids with lower efficiency."
1208,Results from chemical modification studies are consistent with the presence of multiple essential histidine residues in the enzyme.The initial step in the anoxic metabolism of nitrilotriacetate (NTA) was investigated in a denitrifying member of the gamma subgroup of the Proteobacteria.
1209,"In membrane-free cell extracts, the first step of NTA oxidation was catalyzed by a protein complex consisting of two enzymes, NTA dehydrogenase (NTADH) and nitrate reductase (NtR)."
1210,The products formed were iminodiacetate and glyoxylate.
1211,"Electrons derived from the oxidation of NTA were transferred to nitrate only via the artificial dye phenazine methosulfate, and nitrate was stoichiometrically reduced to nitrite."
1212,NTADH activity could be measured only in the presence of NtrR and vice versa.
1213,The NTADH-NtrR enzyme complex was purified and characterized.
1214,"NTADH and NtrR were both alpha 2 dimers and had molecular weights of 170,000 and 105,000, respectively."
1215,"NTADH contained covalently bound flavin cofactor, and NtrR contained a type b cytochrome."
1216,Optimum NTA-oxidizing activity was achieved at a molar ratio of NTADH to NtrR of approximately 1:1.
1217,"So far, NTA is the only known substrate for NTADH."
1218,"This is the first report of a redox enzyme complex catalyzing the oxidation of a substrate and concomitantly reducing nitrate.Naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp."
1219,NCIB 9816-4 and biphenyl dioxygenase from Beijerinckia sp.
1220,B8/36 oxidized the aromatic N-heterocycle carbazole to 3-hydroxycarbazole.
1221,Toluene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida F39/D did not oxidize carbazole.
1222,"Transformations were carried out by mutant strains which oxidize naphthalene and biphenyl to cis-dihydrodiols, and with a recombinant E. coli strain expressing the structural genes of naphthalene 1,2-dioxgenase from Pseudomonas sp."
1223,NCIB 9816-4.
1224,3-Hydroxycarbazole is presumed to result from the dehydration of an unstable cis-dihydrodiol.The mechanism for U(VI) reduction by Desulfovibrio vulgaris (Hildenborough) was investigated.
1225,The H2-dependent U(VI) reductase activity in the soluble fraction of the cells was lost when the soluble fraction was passed over a cationic exchange column which extracted cytochrome c3.
1226,Addition of cytochrome c3 back to the soluble fraction that had been passed over the cationic exchange column restored the U(VI)-reducing capacity.
1227,"Reduced cytochrome c3 was oxidized by U(VI), as was a c-type cytochrome(s) in whole-cell suspensions."
1228,"When cytochrome c3 was combined with hydrogenase, its physiological electron donor, U(VI) was reduced in the presence of H2."
1229,Hydrogenase alone could not reduce U(VI).
1230,Rapid U(VI) reduction was followed by a subsequent slow precipitation of the U(IV) mineral uraninite.
1231,Cytochrome c3 reduced U(VI) in a uranium-contaminated surface water and groundwater.
1232,Cytochrome c3 provides the first enzyme model for the reduction and biomineralization of uranium in sedimentary environments.
1233,"Furthermore, the finding that cytochrome c3 can catalyze the reductive precipitation of uranium may aid in the development of fixed-enzyme reactors and/or organisms with enhanced U(VI)-reducing capacity for the bioremediation of uranium-contaminated waters and waste streams.Chromium reduction by Escherichia coli ATCC 33456 quantitatively transferred hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), to trivalent chromium, Cr(III)."
1234,The reduced chromium was predominantly present in the external medium.
1235,"Supernatant fluids of cell extract, obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 and 150,000 x g, showed almost the same Cr(VI) reduction activity, indicating that Cr(VI) reduction by E. coli ATCC 33456 was a largely soluble reductase activity."
1236,"In studies with respiratory inhibitors, no inhibitory effects on aerobic and anaerobic Cr(VI) reduction were demonstrated by addition of cyanide, azide, and rotenone into both intact cell cultures and supernatant fluids of E. coli ATCC 33456."
1237,"Although cytochromes b and d were identified in the membrane fraction of cell extracts, Cr(VI) was not reduced by the membrane fraction alone."
1238,The cytochrome difference spectra analysis also indicated that these cytochromes of the respiratory chain require the presence of the soluble Cr(VI) reductase to mediate electron transport to Cr(VI).
1239,"Stimulation of Cr(VI) reduction by an uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol, indicated that the respiratory-chain-linked electron transport to Cr(VI) was limited by the rate of dissipation of the proton motive force.A new type of nylon oligomer degradation enzyme (EIII) was purified from an Escherichia coli clone harboring the EIII gene (nylC)."
1240,"This enzyme hydrolyzed the linear trimer, tetramer, and pentamer of 6-aminohexanoate by an endo-type reaction, and this specificity is different from that of the EI (nylA gene product) and EII (nylB gene product)."
1241,Amino acid sequencing and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified EIII demonstrated that the enzyme is made of two polypeptide chains arising from an internal cleavage between amino acid residues 266 and 267.The well-characterized plasmid-encoded naphthalene degradation pathway in Pseudomonas putida PpG7(NAH7) was used to investigate the role of the NAH plasmid-encoded pathway in mineralizing phenanthrene and anthracene.
1242,"Three Pseudomonas strains, designated 5R, DFC49, and DFC50, were recovered from a polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading inoculum developed from a manufactured gas plant soil slurry reactor."
1243,"Plasmids pKA1, pKA2, and pKA3, approximately 100 kb in size, were isolated from these strains and characterized."
1244,These plasmids have homologous regions of upper and lower NAH7 plasmid catabolic genes.
1245,"By conjugation experiments, these plasmids, including NAH7, have been shown to encode the genotype for mineralization of phenanthrene and anthracene, as well as naphthalene."
1246,"One strain, Pseudomonas fluorescens 5RL, which has the complete lower pathway inactivated by transposon insertion in nahG, accumulated a metabolite from phenanthrene and anthracene degradation."
1247,"This is the first direct evidence to indicate that the NAH plasmid-encoded catabolic genes are involved in degradation of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons other than naphthalene.5-Aminosalicylate (5AS) was converted to L-malate, pyruvate and ammonia by cell-free extracts from Pseudomonas sp."
1248,BN9 in the presence of glutathione.
1249,"In the absence of glutathione, 5AS was oxidized to the ring-fission product cis-4-amino-6-carboxy-2-oxo-hexa-3,5-dienoate (cis-ACOHDA)."
1250,Glutathione catalysed the spontaneous isomerization of cis-ACOHDA to its trans-isomer.
1251,The same reaction was catalysed by light and by acidic conditions.
1252,"trans-ACOHDA was enzymically deaminated to fumarylpyruvate (trans-2,4-dioxo-5-hexenoate)."
1253,The trans-ACOHDA hydrolase was induced after growth of Pseudomonas sp.
1254,"BN9 with 5AS, but not after growth with acetate or nutrient broth."
1255,"At the fumarylpyruvate stage, the metabolism of 5AS converged with a pathway described for the degradation of gentisate."
1256,Fumarylpyruvate was cleaved by Pseudomonas sp.
1257,"BN9 to fumarate and pyruvate.A Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes able to use nitrobenzene as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy was isolated from soil and groundwater contaminated with nitrobenzene."
1258,"The range of aromatic substrates able to support growth was limited to nitrobenzene, hydroxylaminobenzene, and 2-aminophenol."
1259,Washed suspensions of nitrobenzene-grown cells removed nitrobenzene from culture fluids with the concomitant release of ammonia.
1260,"Nitrobenzene, nitrosobenzene, hydroxylaminobenzene, and 2-aminophenol stimulated oxygen uptake in resting cells and in extracts of nitrobenzene-grown cells."
1261,"Under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, crude extracts converted nitrobenzene to 2-aminophenol with oxidation of 2 mol of NADPH."
1262,"Ring cleavage, which required ferrous iron, produced a transient yellow product with a maximum A380."
1263,"In the presence of NAD, the product disappeared and NADH was produced."
1264,"In the absence of NAD, the ring fission product was spontaneously converted to picolinic acid, which was not further metabolized."
1265,These results indicate that the catabolic pathway involves the reduction of nitrobenzene to nitrosobenzene and then to hydroxylaminobenzene; each of these steps requires 1 mol of NADPH.
1266,"An enzyme-mediated Bamberger-like rearrangement converts hydroxylaminobenzene to 2-aminophenol, which then undergoes meta ring cleavage to 2-aminomuconic semialdehyde."
1267,The mechanism for release of ammonia and subsequent metabolism are under investigation.Sphingomonas sp.
1268,"strain RW1 synthesized a constitutive enzyme system that oxygenated dibenzofuran (DBF) to 2,2\',3-trihydroxybiphenyl (THB)."
1269,"We purified this dibenzofuran 4,4a-dioxygenase system (DBFDOS) and found it to consist of four components which catalyzed three activities."
1270,"Two isofunctional, monomeric flavoproteins (components A1 and A2; M(r) of about 44,000) transferred electrons from NADH to the second component (B; M(r) of about 12,000), a ferredoxin, which transported electrons to the heteromultimeric (alpha 2 beta 2) oxygenase component (C; M(r) of alpha, 45,000; M(r) of beta, 23,000)."
1271,"DBFDOS consumed 1 mol each of NADH, O2, and DBF, which was dioxygenated to about 1 mol of THB; no intermediate was observed."
1272,The reaction was thus the dioxygenation of DBF at the 4 and 4a positions to give a diene-diol-hemiacetal which rearomatized by spontaneous loss of a phenolate group to form THB.
1273,"Components A1 and A2 each reduced dichlorophenolindophenol but had negligible activity with cytochrome c; each lost the yellow color, observed to be flavin adenine dinucleotide, upon purification."
1274,"Component B, which transported electrons to the oxygenase or cytochrome c, had an N-terminal amino acid sequence with high homology to the putidaredoxin of cytochrome P-450cam."
1275,The oxygenase had the UV spectrum of a Rieske iron-sulfur center.
1276,"We presume DBFDOS to be a class IIA dioxygenase system (EC 1.14.12.-), functionally similar to pyrazon dioxygenase.Corynebacterium sp."
1277,"strain C125, originally isolated on o-xylene, was selected for its ability to grow on tetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) as the sole source of carbon and energy."
1278,The catabolism of tetralin in Corynebacterium sp.
1279,"strain C125 was shown to proceed via initial hydroxylation of the benzene nucleus at positions C-5 and C-6, resulting in the formation of the corresponding cis-dihydro diol."
1280,"Subsequently, the dihydro diol was dehydrogenated by a NAD-dependent dehydrogenase to 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,2-naphthalene diol."
1281,"The aromatic ring was cleaved in the extradiol position by a catechol-2,3-dioxygenase."
1282,"The ring fission product was subject to a hydrolytic attack, resulting in the formation of a carboxylic acid-substituted cyclohexanone."
1283,"This is the first report of the catabolism of tetralin via degradation of the aromatic moiety.Staphylococcus auriculans DBF63, which can grow on dibenzofuran (DBF) or fluorene (FN) as the sole source of carbon and energy, was isolated."
1284,Salicylic acid and gentisic acid accumulated in the culture broth of this strain when DBF was supplied as a growth substrate.
1285,"Also, the formation of 9-fluorenol, 9-fluorenone, 4-hydroxy-9-fluorenone, and 1-hydroxy-9-fluorenone was demonstrated, and accumulation of 1,1a-dihydroxy-1-hydro-9-fluorenone was observed when this strain grew on FN."
1286,"On the basis of these results, the degradation pathways of DBF and FN were proposed."
1287,"The analogous oxidation products of dibenzo-p-dioxin were obtained by incubation with DBF-grown S. auriculans DBF63 cells.A bacterial strain which utilizes 3-methylquinoline as sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy was isolated from activated sludge."
1288,"On the basis of its morphological and physiological characteristics, this isolate was classified as Comamonas testosteroni."
1289,"Four metabolites of 3-methylquinoline degradation were isolated from the culture supernatant and identified as 3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, 6-hydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline, 5,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline and 2,5,6-trihydroxy-3-methylpyridine."
1290,"Based on these results, a degradation pathway for 3-methylquinoline is proposed.Pseudomonas putida ATCC 17453 grew with either (+)- or (-)-camphor as sole carbon source."
1291,Enantiomer-specific \'biological Baeyer-Villiger\' monooxygenases were synthesized irrespective of the camphor isomer used for growth.
1292,The two enzymes are probably the products of separate genes but showed many similarities.
1293,"Each consisted of two electrophoretically identical subunits, bound flavin mononucleotide (FMN) non-covalently and accepted electrons from an induced NADH dehydrogenase which interacted with the FMN bound to the oxygenating component."
1294,"They showed minor differences in M(r) with 3,6-diketocamphane 1,6-monooxygenase being the smaller enzyme."
1295,Isoelectric focussing showed the two enzymes to have different acidic pI values.
1296,"Polyclonal antibodies raised against 3,6-diketocamphane 1,6-monooxygenase also cross-reacted with 2,5-diketocamphane 1,2-monooxygenase and its subunits.The two-component alkyl hydroperoxide reductase enzyme system from Salmonella typhimurium catalyzes the pyridine nucleotide-dependent reduction of alkyl hydroperoxide and hydrogen peroxide substrates."
1297,"This system is composed of a flavoenzyme, AhpF, which is related to the disulfide-reducing enzyme thioredoxin reductase, and a smaller protein, AhpC, which lacks a chromophoric cofactor."
1298,We have demonstrated that NADH-linked reduction of AhpF under anaerobic conditions converts two cystine disulfide centers to their dithiol forms.
1299,"The AhpC cystine disulfide center, shown to exist as an intersubunit disulfide bond, is stoichiometrically reducible by NADH in the presence of a catalytic amount of AhpF and can be reoxidized by ethyl hydroperoxide."
1300,"Disulfide bridges within oxidized AhpF form between Cys129 and Cys132 and between Cys345 and Cys348; the two C-terminal half-cystine residues, Cys476 and Cys489, exist as free thiol groups in oxidized AhpF and play no role in catalysis."
1301,"Removal of the N-terminal 202-amino acid segment containing the Cys129-Cys132 disulfide center obliterates the ability of AhpF to transfer electrons to 5,5\'-dthiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and AhpC."
1302,"NADH added anaerobically to AhpF causes spectral changes consistent with preferential reduction of both disulfides relative to flavin reduction; the reduction potentials of the disulfide centers are thus appropriately poised for electron transfer from NADH and flavin to disulfide-containing substrates (AhpC or DTNB), and ultimately to peroxides from AhpC."
1303,"Blue, neutral flavin semiquinone is also generated in high yields during reductive titrations (91% yield during dithionite titrations), although the relatively slow formation of this species indicates its catalytic incompetence."
1304,"A long wavelength absorbance band beyond 900 nm attributable to an FADH2-->NAD+ charge transfer interaction is generated during NADH, but not dithionite, titrations and may be indicative of a species directly involved in the catalytic cycle."
1305,A catalytic mechanism including the transient formation of cysteine sulfenic acid within AhpC is proposed.The bacterial degradation and detoxification of chlorinated xenobiotic compounds requires the production of enzymes that are capable of recognizing and converting compounds which do not occur at significant concentrations in nature.
1306,"We have studied the catabolic route of 1,2-dichloroethane as an example of a pathway for the conversion of such a synthetic compound."
1307,"In strains of Xanthobacter and Ancylobacter that have been isolated on 1,2-dichloroethane, the first catabolic step is catalyzed by a hydrolytic haloalkane dehalogenase."
1308,"The enzyme converts 1,2-dichloroethane to 2-chloroethanol but is also active with many other environmentally important haloalkanes such as methylchloride, methylbromide, 1,2-dibromoethane, epichlorohydrin, and 1,3-dichloropropene."
1309,Further degradation of 2-chloroethanol proceeds by oxidation to the carboxylic acid and dehalogenation to glycolate.
1310,The aldehyde dehydrogenase prevents toxicity of the reactive chloroacetaldehyde that is formed as an intermediate and is necessary for establishing a functional 2-chloroethanol degradative pathway in a strain that is not capable of growth on this compound.Comamonas testosteroni YZW-D was isolated from Passaic River sediment for its ability to degrade isophthalate and terephthalate.
1311,Degradation of the two isomeric compounds proceeds via separately inducible catabolic pathways that converge at protocatechuate.
1312,Analysis of the catabolic pathways by which these two isomers are degraded demonstrated that a cis-dihydrodiol intermediate is involved in both pathways.
1313,The genes for the conversion of isophthalate and terephthalate to protocatechuate were cloned on a single fragment of genomic DNA from C. testosteroni YZW-D.
1314,The two operons were located by subcloning and mutant complementation experiments.
1315,The regions coding for the two degradative pathways were sequenced.
1316,"Analysis of the nucleotide sequence for the isophthalate degradation operon located genes for a dioxygenase, a transport protein, a cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and a reductase."
1317,"Analysis of the nucleotide sequence for the terephthalate degradation operon located genes for a regulatory protein, a transport protein, a dioxygenase large subunit, a dioxygenase small subunit, a cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and a reductase.The degradation of three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), pyrene (PYR), benzanthracene (BAA), and benzopyrene (BaP), by Mycobacterium sp."
1318,strain RJGII-135 was studied.
1319,The bacterium was isolated from an abandoned coal gasification site soil by analog enrichment techniques and found to mineralize PYR.
1320,Further degradation studies with PYR showed three metabolites formed by Mycobacterium sp.
1321,"strain RJGII-135, including 4,5-phenanthrene-dicarboxylic acid not previously isolated, 4-phenanthrene-carboxylic acid, and 4,5-pyrene-dihydrodiol."
1322,"At least two dihydrodiols, 5,6-BAA-dihydrodiol and 10,11-BAA-dihydrodiol, were confirmed by high-resolution mass spectral and fluorescence analyses as products of the biodegradation of BAA by Mycobacterium sp."
1323,strain RJGII-135.
1324,"Additionally, a cleavage product of BAA was also isolated."
1325,Mass spectra and fluorescence data support two different routes for the degradation of BaP by Mycobacterium sp.
1326,strain RJGII-135.
1327,"The 7,8-BaP-dihydrodiol and three cleavage products of BaP, including 4,5-chrysene-dicarboxylic acid and a dihydro-pyrene-carboxylic acid metabolite, have been isolated and identified as degradation products formed by Mycobacterium sp."
1328,strain RJGII-135.
1329,These latter results represent the first example of the isolation of BaP ring fission products formed by a bacterial isolate.
1330,"We propose that while this bacterium appears to attack only one site of the PYR molecule, it is capable of degrading different sites of the BAA and BaP molecules, and although the sites of attack may be different, the ability of this bacterium to degrade these PAH is well supported."
1331,The proposed pathways for biodegradation of these compounds by this Mycobacterium sp.
1332,strain RJGII-135 support the dioxygenase enzymatic processes reported previously for other bacteria.
1333,Microorganisms like Mycobacterium sp.
1334,strain RJGII-135 will be invaluable in attaining the goal of remediation of sites containing mixtures of these PAH.A mixed culture that could utilize cocaine as the sole source of carbon and energy for growth was isolated by selective enrichment.
1335,The individual microorganisms within this mixed culture were identified as Pseudomonas fluorescens (termed MBER) and Comamonas acidovorans (termed MBLF).
1336,Each microorganism was shown to be unable to grow to any appreciable extent on 10 mM cocaine in the absence of the other.
1337,C. acidovorans MBLF was found to possess an inducible cocaine esterase which catalyzed the hydrolysis of cocaine to ecgonine methyl ester and benzoate.
1338,C. acidovorans was capable of growth on benzoate at concentrations below 5 mM but was unable to metabolize ecgonine methyl ester.
1339,P. fluorescens MBER was capable of growth on either benzoate as the sole source of carbon or ecgonine methyl ester as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen.
1340,"P. fluorescens MBER was found to initiate the degradation of ecgonine methyl ester via ecgonine, pseudoecgonine, and pseudoecgonyl-coenzyme A. Subcellular studies resulted in the identification of an ecgonine methyl esterase, an ecgonine epimerase, and a pseudoecgonyl-coenzyme A synthetase which were induced by growth on ecgonine methyl ester or ecgonine."
1341,"Further metabolism of the ecgonine moiety is postulated to involve nitrogen debridging, with the production of carbonyl-containing intermediates.Corynebacterium sepedonicum KZ-4, described earlier as a strain capable of growth on 2,4-dichlorobenzoate (G.M."

1348,"53:810-815, 1987)."
1349,"2-Chloro-4-fluorobenzoate was found to be converted stoichiometrically to 4-fluorobenzoate by resting cells of strain KZ-4, compatible with a reductive process."
1350,"Experiments with cell extracts demonstrated that Mg - ATP and coenzyme A (CoA) were required to stimulate reductive dehalogenation, consistent with the intermediacy of 2-chloro-4-fluoro-benzoyl-CoA and 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl-CoA thioesters."
1351,"2,4-Dichlorobenzoyl-CoA was shown to be converted to 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA in a novel NADPH-dependent reaction in extracts of both KZ-4 and NTB-1."
1352,"In addition to the ligase and reductive dehalogenase activities, hydrolytic 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA dehalogenase and thioesterase activities, 4-hydroxybenzoate 3-monooxygenase, and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase activities were demonstrated to be present in the soluble fraction of KZ-4 extracts following ultracentrifugation."
1353,"We propose that the pathway for 2,4-dichlorobenzoate catabolism in strains KZ-4 and NTB-1 involves formation of 2,4-dichlorobenzoyl-CoA, NADPH-dependent ortho dehalogenation yielding 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA, hydrolytic removal of chlorine from the para position to generate 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA, hydrolysis to form 4-hydroxybenzoate, oxidation to yield protocatechuate, and oxidative ring cleavage.The chlorobenzene degradation pathway of Pseudomonas sp."
1354,strain P51 is an evolutionary novelty.
1355,"The first enzymes of the pathway, the chlorobenzene dioxygenase and the cis-chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, are encoded on a plasmid-located transposon Tn5280."
1356,"Chlorobenzene dioxygenase is a four-protein complex, formed by the gene products of tcbAa for the large subunit of the terminal oxygenase, tcbAb for the small subunit, tcbAc for the ferredoxin, and tcbAd for the NADH reductase."
1357,"Directly downstream of tcbAd is the gene for the cis-chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, tcbB."
1358,"Homology comparisons indicated that these genes and gene products are most closely related to those for toluene (todC1C2BAD) and benzene degradation (bedC1C2BA and bnzABCD) and distantly to those for biphenyl, naphthalene, and benzoate degradation."
1359,"Similar to the tod-encoded enzymes, chlorobenzene dioxygenase and cis-chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase were capable of oxidizing 1,2-dichlorobenzene, toluene, naphthalene, and biphenyl, but not benzoate, to the corresponding dihydrodiol and dihydroxy intermediates."
1360,"These data strongly suggest that the chlorobenzene dioxygenase and dehydrogenase originated from a toluene or benzene degradation pathway, probably by horizontal gene transfer."
1361,This evolutionary event left its traces as short gene fragments directly outside the tcbAB coding regions.Pseudomonas putida F1 utilizes p-cumate (p-isopropylbenzoate) as a growth substrate by means of an eight-step catabolic pathway.
1362,"A 35.75-kb DNA segment, within which the cmt operon encoding the catabolism of p-cumate is located, was cloned as four separate overlapping restriction fragments and mapped with restriction endonucleases."
1363,"By examining enzyme activities in recombinant bacteria carrying these fragments and sub-cloned fragments, genes encoding most of the enzymes of the p-cumate pathway were located."
1364,"Subsequent sequence analysis of 11,260 bp gave precise locations of the 12 genes of the cmt operon."
1365,"The first three genes, cmtAaAbAc, and the sixth gene, cmtAd, encode the components of p-cumate 2,3-dioxygenase (ferredoxin reductase, large subunit of the terminal dioxygenase, small subunit of the terminal dioxygenase, and ferredoxin, respectively); these genes are separated by cmtC, which encodes 2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate 3,4-dioxygenase, and cmtB, coding for 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydro-p-cumate dehydrogenase."
1366,"The ring cleavage product, 2-hydroxy-3-carboxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate, is acted on by a decarboxylase encoded by the seventh gene, cmtD, which is followed by a large open reading frame, cmtI, of unknown function."
1367,"The next four genes, cmtEFHG, encode 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-7-methylocta-2,4-dienoate hydrolase, 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate hydratase, 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase, and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, respectively, which transform the decarboxylation product to amphibolic intermediates."
1368,The deduced amino acid sequences of all the cmt gene products except CmtD and CmtI have a recognizable but low level of identity with amino acid sequences of enzymes catalyzing analogous reactions in other catabolic pathways.
1369,"This identity is highest for the last two enzymes of the pathway (4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase ), which have identities of 66 to 77% with the corresponding enzymes from other aromatic meta-cleavage pathways."
1370,Recombinant bacteria carrying certain restriction fragments bordering the cmt operon were found to transform indole to indigo.
1371,"This reaction, known to be catalyzed by toluene 2,3-dioxygenase, led to the discovery that the tod operon, encoding the catabolism of toluene, is located 2.8 kb downstream from and in the same orientation as the cmt operon in P. putida F1.On the basis of the available high-resolution structures of mandelate racemase (MR) from Pseudomonas putida , Lys 166 and His 297 are positioned appropriately to participate in catalysis as acid/base catalysts, with Lys 166 participating as the (S)-specific acid/base catalyst and His 297 participating as the (R)-specific acid/base catalyst."
1372,The dependence of kcat on pH for the racemization of both (R)- and (S)-mandelates suggests that the pKaS of the conjugate acids of Lys 166 and His 297 are both approximately 6.4 .
1373,Both acid/base catalysts are in close proximity to and approximately equidistant to the epsilon-ammonium group of Lys 164 and the essential Mg2+.
1374,"The positive electrostatic potential provided by these cationic groups might be expected to increase the acidities of the cationic conjugate acids of the acid/base catalysts, thereby explaining the depressed pKa of Lys 166 but not the ""normal"" pKa of His 297."
1375,"Asp 270 is hydrogen bonded of N delta of His 297 and, therefore, may allow the pKa of His 297 to be normal."
1376,In this paper we report the structural and mechanistic properties of the mutant in which Asp 270 is replaced with asparagine (D270N).
1377,"The structure of D270N with (S)-atrolactate bound in the active site reveals no geometric alterations in the active site when compared to the structure of wild-type MR complexed with (S)-atrolactate, with the exception that the side chain of His 297 is tilted and displaced approximately 0.5 A away from Asn 270 and toward the (S)-atrolactate."
1378,The kcatS for both (R)- and (S)-mandelates are reduced approximately 10(4)-fold.
1379,"In accord with the proposal that Asp 270 influences the pKa of His 297, in the (R)- to (S)-direction no ascending limb is detected in the dependence of kcat of pH; instead, kcat decreases from a low pH plateau as described by a pKa of 10."
1380,In the (S)- to (R)-direction the dependence of kcat of pH is a bell-shaped curve that is described by pKaS of 6.4 and 10.
1381,"In analogy to the previously reported properties of the H297N mutant , D270N catalyzes both the facile exchange of the alpha-proton of (S)- but not (R)-mandelate with solvent and the stereospecific elimination of bromide ion from (S)-p-(bromomethyl)mandalate."
1382,"These observations suggest that His 297 and Asp 270 function as a catalytic dyad, with Asp 270 being at least partially responsible for the normal pKa of His 297 in wild-type MR.Using a wide variety of N- and S-oxide compounds we have shown by kinetic analysis that only two N-oxides, trimethylamine-N-oxide and 4-methylmorpholine-N-oxide, can be considered good substrates for trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) reductase on the basis of their kcat/Km ratio."
1383,This result demonstrates that TMAO reductase possesses a high substrate specificity.
1384,Induction of the torCAD operon using the same S- and N-oxide compounds was also analyzed.
1385,We demonstrate that there is no correlation between the ability for a compound to be reduced by TMAO reductase and to induce TMAO reductase synthesis.Naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) from Pseudomonas sp.
1386,"strain NCIB 9816-4 adds both atoms of the dioxygen molecule to styrene to form (R)-l-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol."
1387,Product formation is tightly coupled to dioxygen consumption and NADH oxidation.
1388,NDO oxidizes styrene-d8 at almost the same initial rate as styrene.
1389,"The results indicate that dioxygen activation by NDO is different from that by cytochrome P-450 and other monooxygenases, which oxidize styrene to styrene 1,2-oxide.Tetrachloroethene reductive dehalogenase from the tetrachloroethene-utilizing anaerobe, Dehalospirillum multivorans, was purified approximately 100-fold to apparent homogeneity."
1390,"The purified dehalogenase catalyzed the reductive dechlorination of tetrachloroethene (PCE) to trichloroethene and of trichloroethene to cis-1,2-dichloroethene with reduced methyl viologen as the electron donor at a specific activity of 2.6 microkatal/mg."
1391,"The apparent Km values for tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene were 0.20 and 0.24 mM, respectively."
1392,The apparent molecular mass of the native enzyme was determined by gel filtration to be 58 kDa.
1393,Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis revealed a single protein band with a molecular mass of 57 kDa.
1394,"One mol of dehalogenase contained 1.0 mol of corrinoid, 9.8 mol of iron, and 8.0 mol of acid-labile sulfur."
1395,The pH optimum was about 8.0.
1396,The enzyme had a temperature optimum of 42 degrees C. It was slightly oxygen-sensitive and was thermolabile above 50 degrees C. The dechlorination of PCE was stimulated by ammonium ions.
1397,"Chlorinated methanes severely inhibited PCE dehalogenase activity.The polyether-macrolide antibiotic, boromycin, was isolated as a potent anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibiotic from a fermentation broth of Streptomyces sp."

1399,Boromycin was found to strongly inhibit the replication of the clinically isolated HIV-1 strain as well as the cultured strain in in vitro laboratory experiments.
1400,"The mechanism for the anti-HIV activity of boromycin is suggested to involve blocking the later stage of HIV infection, and probably the maturity step for replication of the HIV molecule.Toluene is degraded anoxically to CO2 by the denitrifying bacterium Thauera aromatica."
1401,Toluene first becomes oxidized to benzoyl-CoA by O2-independent reactions.
1402,Benzoyl-CoA is then reduced to non-aromatic products by benzoyl-CoA reductase.
1403,We set out to study the reactions employed for the initial activation of toluene and its oxidation to the level of benzoate.
1404,Evidence is provided for a novel way of toluene degradation based on experiments with cell-free extracts and with whole toluene-grown cells: Cell-free extracts oxidized toluene to benzoyl-CoA via several radioactive intermediates.
1405,"This reaction was strictly dependent on the presence of fumarate, coenzyme A and nitrate as electron acceptor; acetyl-CoA and ATP were not necessary for the reaction."
1406,The first product formed in vitro was benzylsuccinate; (2H8)toluene was converted to (2H7)benzylsuccinate.
1407,"Formation of benzylsuccinate from toluene was independent of coenzyme A and nitrate, but it required the presence of fumarate."
1408,Other tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates were converted to fumarate in cell extracts and therefore could partially substitute for fumarate.
1409,Benzylsuccinate was oxidized further to benzoyl-CoA and benzoate in cell extracts if coenzyme A and nitrate were present.
1410,No benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde and no phenylpropionate could be detected as intermediates.
1411,"In isotope trapping experiments with cell suspensions, two intermediates from toluene were detected, benzoate and benzylsuccinate."
1412,This corroborates the sequence of reactions deduced from in vitro experiments.
1413,A hypothetical degradation pathway for the anaerobic oxidation of toluene to benzoyl-CoA via an initial addition of fumarate to the methyl group of toluene and following beta-oxidation of the benzylsuccinate formed is suggested.Purified naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) from Pseudomonas sp.
1414,"strain NCIB 9816-4 oxidized toluene to benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde by reactions involving benzylic monooxygenation and dioxygen-dependent alcohol oxidation, respectively."
1415,Xylene and nitrotoluene isomers were also oxidized to substituted benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde derivatives.
1416,NDO oxidized ethylbenzene sequentially through (S)-1-phenethyl alcohol (77% enantiomeric excess) and acetophenone to 2-hydroxyacetophenone.
1417,"In addition, NDO also oxidized ethylbenzene through styrene to (R)-1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol (74% enantiomeric excess) by reactions involving desaturation and dihydroxylation, respectively."
1418,"Isotope experiments with 18O2, H2 18O, and D2O suggest that 1-phenethyl alcohol is oxidized to acetophenone by a minor reaction involving desaturation followed by tautomerization."
1419,"The major reaction in the conversion of 1-phenethyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol to acetophenone and benzaldehyde, respectively, probably involves monohydroxylation to form a gem-diol intermediate which stereospecifically loses the incoming hydroxyl group to leave the carbonyl product."
1420,"These results are compared with similar reactions catalyzed by cytochrome P-450.The oxidation of 9,10-dihydroanthracene and 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene was examined with mutant and recombinant strains expressing naphthalene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida (NCIB 9816.4."
1421,"Salicylate-induced cells of P. putida strain 9816/11 and isopropylthiogalactopyranoside-induced cells of Escherichia coli JM109(DE3)(pDTG141) oxidized 9,10-dihydroanthracene to (+)-cis-1R,2S)-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2,9,10-tetrahydroanthracene (> 95% relative yield; > 95% enantiomeric excess) as the major product."
1422,"9-Hydroxy-9,10-dihydroanthracene (< 5% relative yield) was a minor product formed by both organisms."
1423,"The same cells oxidized 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene to (+)-cis-(3S,4R)-3,4-dihydroxy-3,4,9,10-tetrahydrophenanthrene (70% relative yield; > 95% enantiomeric excess) and (+)-(S)-9-hydroxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene (30% relative yield)."
1424,"The major reaction catalyzed by naphthalene dioxygenase with 9,10-dihydroanthracene and 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene was stereospecific dihydroxylation in which both of the previously undescribed cis-diene diols were of R configuration at the benzylic center adjacent to the bridgehead carbon atom."
1425,"The results suggest that for benzocylic substrates, the location of benzylic carbons influences the type of reaction(s) catalyzed by naphthalene dioxygenase.Camphor (cytochrome P450) 5-monooxygenase, originally isolated from the bacterium Pseudomonas putida PgG 786, catalyzes the essentially stereospecific conversion of tetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) to (R)-1-tetralol ((R)."
1426,"(-)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthol): tetralin(aq) + NADH(aq) + O2(aq) = (R)-1-tetralol(aq) + NAD(aq) + H2O(l)."
1427,The ratio of the amount of (S)-1-tetralol to the amount of (R)-1-tetralol is small (approximately 0.04) and the reaction is essentially stereospecific.
1428,The reaction time-course plot indicates the formation of additional product(s) from the (R)-1-tetralol.
1429,"It is found that the above reaction obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics and that dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol, and p-dioxane serve as accelerators."
1430,"Approximate values of a Michaelis constant Km, limiting rate Vmax, and catalytic constant kcat are obtained for this reaction under a specified set of conditions."
1431,It is shown by means of a thermochemical cycle calculation that the apparent equilibrium constant for this reaction is approximately 4 x 10(65) at T = 298.15 K and pH 7.3.
1432,"Thus, this reaction is ""irreversible"" and, unless the enzyme system is inactivated, it will proceed in the direction of complete formation of 1-tetralol from tetralin."
1433,A detailed description of the preparation of the camphor (cytochrome P450) 5-monooxygenase enzyme system from recombinant microorganisms is given.The oxidation of dibenzothiophene to dibenzothiophene sulfone has been linked to the enzyme encoded by the sox/dszC gene from Rhodococcus sp.

1439,"However, this enzyme has not been characterized, and the type of its catalytic activity remains unclassified."
1440,"In this work, the sox/dszC gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, a procedure for the purification of the expressed enzyme was developed, and the properties of and the reactions catalyzed by the purified enzyme were characterized."
1441,"This enzyme binds one flavin mononucleotide (Kd, 7 micrometers) or reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2) (Kd < 10(-8) M) per 90,200-Da homodimer, and FMNH2 is an essential cosubstrate for its activity."
1442,"Patterns of product formation were examined under different FMNH2 availabilities, and results indicate that this enzyme catalyzes a stepwise conversion of dibenzothiophene to the corresponding sulfoxide and subsequently to the sulfone."
1443,"On the basis of isotope labeling patterns with H2(18)O and 18O2, dibenzothiophene sulfoxide and sulfone obtained their oxygen atom(s) from molecular oxygen rather than water in their formation from dibenzothiophene."
1444,The enzyme also utilizes benzyl sulfide and benzyl sulfoxide as substrates.
1445,"Hence, it is identified as a sulfide/sulfoxide monooxygenase."
1446,"This monooxygenase is similar to the microsomal flavin-containing monooxygenase but is unique among microbial flavomonooxygenases in its ability to catalyze two consecutive monooxygenation reactions.Initial reactions in anaerobic oxidation of ethylbenzene were investigated in a denitrifying bacterium, strain EB1."
1447,"Cells of strain EB1 mineralized ethylbenzene to CO2 under denitrifying conditions, as demonstrated by conversion of 69% of ethylbenzene to 14CO2."
1448,"In anaerobic suspensions of strain EB1 cells metabolizing ethylbenzene, the transient formation and consumption of 1-phenylethanol, acetophenone, and an as yet unidentified compound were observed."
1449,"On the basis of growth experiments and spectroscopic data, the unknown compound is proposed to be benzoyl acetate."
1450,"Cell suspension experiments using H2(18)O demonstrated that the hydroxyl group of the first product of anoxic ethylbenzene oxidation, 1-phenylethanol, is derived from water."
1451,A tentative pathway for anaerobic ethylbenzene mineralization by strain EB1 is proposed.Our review of the metabolic pathways of pyridines and aza-arenes showed that biodegradation of heterocyclic aromatic compounds occurs under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
1452,"Depending upon the environmental conditions, different types of bacteria, fungi, and enzymes are involved in the degradation process of these compounds."
1453,Our review indicated that different organisms are using different pathways to biotransform a substrate.
1454,Our review also showed that the transformation rate of the pyridine derivatives is dependent on the substituents.
1455,"For example, pyridine carboxylic acids have the highest transformation rate followed by mono-hydroxypyridines, methylpyridines, aminopyridines, and halogenated pyridines."
1456,"Through the isolation of metabolites, it was possible to demonstrate the mineralization pathway of various heterocyclic aromatic compounds."
1457,"By using 14C-labeled substrates, it was possible to show that ring fission of a specific heterocyclic compound occurs at a specific position of the ring."
1458,"Furthermore, many researchers have been able to isolate and characterize the microorganisms or even the enzymes involved in the transformation of these compounds or their derivatives."
1459,"In studies involving 18O labeling as well as the use of cofactors and coenzymes, it was possible to prove that specific enzymes (e.g., mono- or dioxygenases) are involved in a particular degradation step."
1460,"By using H2 18O, it could be shown that in certain transformation reactions, the oxygen was derived from water and that therefore these reactions might also occur under anaerobic conditions.An acidophilic, disulfide-oxidizing, mesophilic, aerobic bacterium was isolated from wastewater sludge."
1461,The new organism is a gram-positive sporulated rod.
1462,It can use elemental sulfur and pyrite as sole energy sources and grows on organic substrates such as glutamate and glucose.
1463,"It also grows on the following organic sulfur substrates: oxidized and reduced glutathione, cysteine, cystine, and dithio(bis)benzothiazole and clearly shows a preference for disulfide bond-containing substrates."
1464,"The optimal pH of growth is between 1.5 and 2.5, depending on the substrate used, and the growth temperature range varies from 4 to 40 degrees C, with an optimal value at 35 degrees C. The G + C chromosomal DNA content was measured at 53 +/- 1 mol%."
1465,Phylogenetic analysis of 16S genes coding for rRNA sequences places the new isolate in the genus Sulfobacillus.
1466,"In addition, unique phenotypic and physiologic characteristics and DNA homology values assign the isolate to a new species in the genus."
1467,"Therefore, this new isolate has been named Sulfobacillus disulfidooxidans and has been assigned ATCC number 51911.The regio- and stereospecific oxidation of fluorene, dibenzofuran, and dibenzothiophene was examined with mutant and recombinant strains expressing naphthalene dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp."
1468,strain NCIB 9816-4.
1469,The initial oxidation products were isolated and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry.

1471,"strain 9816/11 and isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside-induced cells of Escherichia coli JM109(DE3)(pDTG141) oxidized fluorene to (+)-(3S,4R)-cis-3,4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrofluorene (80 to 90% relative yield; > 95% enantiomeric excess ) and 9-fluorenol (< 10% yield)."
1472,"The same cells oxidized dibenzofuran to (1R,2S)-cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1, 2-dihydrodibenzofuran (60 to 70% yield; > 95% ee) and (3S,4R)-cis-3, 4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrodibenzofuran (30 to 40% yield; > 95% ee)."
1473,"Induced cells of both strains, as well as the purified dioxygenase, also oxidized dibenzothiophene to (+)-(1R,2S)-cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1, 2-dihydrodibenzothiophene (84 to 87% yield; > 95% ee) and dibenzothiophene sulfoxide (< 15% yield)."
1474,The major reaction catalyzed by naphthalene dioxygenase with each substrate was stereospecific dihydroxylation in which the cis-dihydrodiols were of identical regiochemistry and of R configuration at the benzylic center adjacent to the bridgehead carbon atom.
1475,"The regiospecific oxidation of dibenzofuran differed from that of the other substrates in that a significant amount of the minor cis-3,4-dihydrodiol regioisomer was formed."
1476,"The results indicate that although the absolute stereochemistry of the cis-diene diols was the same, the nature of the bridging atom or heteroatom influenced the regiospecificity of the reactions catalyzed by naphthalene dioxygenase.Bacterial strains expressing naphthalene, biphenyl, and toluene dioxygenase were examined for their abilities to oxidize 6,7-dihydro-5H-benzocycloheptene (benzocyclohept-1-ene)."
1477,"The major oxidation products were isolated, and their absolute configurations were determined by chiral 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of diastereomeric boronate esters, chiral stationary-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, and stereo-chemical correlation."

1479,strain 9816/11 and Sphingomonas yanoikuyae (formerly identified as a Beijerinckia sp.)
1480,"B8/36 expressing naphthalene and biphenyl dioxygenases, respectively, oxidized benzocyclohept-1-ene to a major product identified as (-)-(1R,2S)-cis-dihydroxybenzocycloheptane (> 98% enantiomeric excess , 50 and 90% yield, respectively)."
1481,"In contrast, Pseudomonas putida F39/D expressing toluene dioxygenase oxidized benzocyclohept-1-ene to (+)-(5R)-hydroxybenzocyclohept-1-ene (> 98% ee, 90% yield) as the major metabolite and to the ""opposite"" diol, (+)-(1S,2R)-cis-dihydroxybenzocycloheptane (> 98% ee, 10% yield)."
1482,"The results indicate that, for benzocyclohept-1-ene, the major reaction catalyzed by naphthalene and biphenyl dioxygenases is dioxygenation whereas toluene dioxygenase catalyzes mainly R-stereospecific benzylic monooxygenation."
1483,"Although the type of reaction catalyzed by each organism was not predictable, the absolute configuration of the diol and monol products formed by naphthalene and toluene dioxygenases are consistent with the stereochemistry of the products formed by these enzymes from other benzocycloalkene substrates.The yeast-like fungus Exophiala jeanselmei degrades styrene via initial oxidation of the vinyl side chain to phenylacetic acid, which is subsequently hydroxylated to homogentisic acid."
1484,"The initial reactions are catalyzed by a NADPH- and flavin adenine dinucleotide-dependent styrene monooxygenase, a styrene oxide isomerase, and a NAD(+)-dependent phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase."
1485,"The reduced CO-difference spectrum of microsomal preparations of styrene-grown cells shows a characteristic absorption maximum at 450 nm, which strongly suggests the involvement of a cytochrome P-450-dependent styrene monooxygenase."
1486,"Inhibition of styrene monooxygenase activity in cell extracts by cytochrome P-450 inhibitors SKF-525-A, metyrapone, and CO confirms this assumption.Pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase, which reductively liberates nitrite from nitrate esters, is related to old yellow enzyme."
1487,"Pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase follows a ping-pong mechanism with competitive substrate inhibition by NADPH, is strongly inhibited by steroids, and is capable of reducing the unsaturated bond of 2-cyclohexen-1-one.A novel methylotroph, strain M2, capable of utilizing methanesulfonic acid (MSA) as a sole source of carbon and energy was the subject of these investigations."
1488,The initial step in the biodegradative pathway of MSA in strain M2 involved an inducible NADH-specific monooxygenase enzyme (MSAMO).
1489,Partial purification of MSAMO from cell-free extracts by ion-exchange chromatography led to the loss of MSAMO activity.
1490,"Activity was restored by the mixing of three distinct protein fractions designated A, B and C. The reconstituted enzyme had a narrow substrate specificity relative to crude cell-free extracts."
1491,"Addition of FAD and ferrous ions to the reconstituted enzyme complex resulted in a fivefold increase in enzyme activity, suggesting the loss of FAD and ferrous ion from the multicomponent enzyme on purification."
1492,"Analysis of mutants of strain M2 defective in the metabolism of C1 compounds indicated that methanol was not an intermediate in the degradative pathway of MSA and also confirmed the involvement of a multicomponent enzyme in the degradation of MSA by methylotroph strain M2.The biodegradation potential of dimethylsilanediol, the monomer unit of polydimethylsiloxane, in soils was investigated."
1493,"Dimethylsilanediol was found to be biodegraded in all of the tested soils, as monitored by the production of 14CO2."
1494,"When 2-propanol was added to the soil as a carbon source in addition to dimethylsilanediol, the production of 14CO2 increased."
1495,A method for the selection of primary substrates that support cometabolic degradation of a target compound was developed.
1496,"By this method, the activity observed in the soils was successfully transferred to liquid culture."
1497,"A fungus, Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtendahl, and a bacterium, an Arthrobacter species, were isolated from two different soils, and both microorganisms were able to cometabolize dimethylsilanediol to 14CO2 in liquid culture."
1498,"In addition, the Arthrobacter sp."
1499,"that was isolated grew on dimethylsulfone, and we believe that this is the first reported instance of a microorganism using dimethylsulfone as its primary carbon source."
1500,"Previous evidence has shown that polydimethylsiloxane is hydrolyzed in soil to the monomer, dimethylsilanediol."
1501,"Now, biodegradation of dimethylsilanediol in soil has been demonstrated.Anaerobic assays conducted with strain T, a denitrifying bacterium capable of mineralizing toluene to carbon dioxide, demonstrated that toluene-grown, permeabilized cells catalyzed the addition of toluene to fumarate to form benzylsuccinate."
1502,This reaction was not dependent on the presence of coenzyme A (CoA) or ATP.
1503,"In the presence of CoA, formation of E-phenylitaconate from benzylsuccinate was also observed."
1504,Kinetic studies demonstrated that the specific rate of benzylsuccinate formation from toluene and fumarate in assays with permeabilized cells was >30% of the specific rate of toluene consumption in whole-cell suspensions with nitrate; this observation suggests that benzylsuccinate formation may be the first reaction in anaerobic toluene degradation by strain T. Use of deuterium-labeled toluene and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated that the H atom abstracted from the toluene methyl group during addition to fumarate was retained in the succinyl moiety of benzylsuccinate.
1505,"In this study, no evidence was found to support previously proposed reactions of toluene with acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA."
1506,"Toluene-grown, permeabilized cells of strain T also catalyzed the addition of o-xylene to fumarate to form (2-methylbenzyl)succinate."
1507,"o-Xylene is not a growth substrate for strain T, and its transformation was probably cometabolic."
1508,"With the exception of specific reaction rates, the observed characteristics of the toluene-fumarate addition reaction (i.e., retention of a methyl H atom and independence from CoA and ATP) also apply to the o-xylene-fumarate addition reaction."
1509,"Thus, addition to fumarate may be a biochemical strategy to anaerobically activate a range of methylbenzenes.Pseudomonas sp."
1510,"strain AT3 grew with dl-tropic acid, the aromatic component of the alkaloid atropine, as the sole source of carbon and energy."
1511,"Tropic acid-grown cells rapidly oxidized the growth substrate, phenylacetaldehyde, and phenylacetic acid."
1512,"Crude cell extracts, prepared from dl-tropic acid-grown cells, contained two NAD+-linked dehydrogenases which were separated by ion-exchange chromatography and shown to be specific for their respective substrates, dl-tropic acid and phenylacetaldehyde."
1513,Phenylacetaldehyde dehydrogenase was relatively unstable.
1514,"The stable tropic acid dehydrogenase was purified to homogeneity by a combination of ion-exchange, molecular-sieve, and affinity chromatography."
1515,"It had a pH optimum of 9.5 and was equally active with both enantiomers of tropic acid, and at this pH, phenylacetaldehyde was the only detectable product of tropic acid oxidation."
1516,"The formation of phenylacetaldehyde from tropic acid requires, in addition to dehydrogenation, a decarboxylation step."
1517,"By analogy with NAD+-specific isocitrate and malate dehydrogenases, phenylmalonic semialdehyde, a 3-oxoacid, would be expected to be the precursor of phenylacetaldehyde."
1518,"Other workers have established that isocitrate and malate dehydrogenases catalyze the decarboxylation of enzyme-bound or added 3-oxoacid intermediates, a reaction that requires Mn2+ or Mg2+ ions."
1519,"Studies with tropic acid dehydrogenase were hampered by lack of availability of phenylmalonic semialdehyde, but in the absence of added divalent metal ions, both enantiomers of tropic acid were completely oxidized and we have not, by a number of approaches, found any evidence for the transient accumulation of phenylmalonic semialdehyde.Nitrilotriacetate (NTA) is an important chelating agent in detergents and has also been used extensively in processing radionuclides."
1520,"In Chelatobacter heintzii ATCC 29600, biodegradation of NTA is initiated by NTA monooxygenase that oxidizes NTA to iminodiacetate and glyoxylate."
1521,"The NTA monooxygenase activity requires two component proteins, component A and component B, but the function of each component is unclear."
1522,"We have cloned and sequenced a gene cluster encoding components A and B (nmoA and nmoB) and two additional open reading frames, nmoR and nmoT, downstream of nmoA."
1523,"Based on sequence similarities, nmoR and nmoT probably encode a regulatory protein and a transposase, respectively."
1524,The NmoA sequence was similar to a monooxygenase that uses reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2) as reductant; NmoB was similar to an NADH:flavin mononucleotide (FMN) oxidoreductase.
1525,"On the basis of this information, we tested the function of each component."
1526,"Purified component B was shown to be an NADH:FMN oxidoreductase, and its activity could be separated from that of component A."
1527,"When the Photobacterium fischeri NADH:FMN oxidoreductase was substituted for component B in the complete reaction, NTA was oxidized, showing that the substrate specificity of the reaction resides in component A."
1528,"Component A is therefore an NTA monooxygenase that uses FMNH2 and O2 to oxidize NTA, and component B is an NADH:FMN oxidoreductase that provides FMNH2 for NTA oxidation.Identification of new metabolites and demonstration of key enzyme activities support and extend the pathways previously reported for fluorene metabolism by Arthrobacter sp."
1529,strain F101.
1530,"Washed-cell suspensions of strain F101 with fluorene accumulated 9-fluorenone, 4-hydroxy-9-fluorenone, 3-hydroxy-1-indanone, 1-indanone, 2-indanone, 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl) propionate, and a compound tentatively identified as a formyl indanone."
1531,Incubations with 2-indanone produced 3-isochromanone.
1532,The growth yield with fluorene as a sole source of carbon and energy corresponded to an assimilation of about 34% of fluorene carbon.
1533,"About 7.4% was transformed into 9-fluorenol, 9-fluorenone, and 4-hydroxy-9-fluorenone."
1534,"Crude extracts from fluorene-induced cells showed 3,4-dihydrocoumarin hydrolase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activities."
1535,These results and biodegradation experiments with the identified metabolites indicate that metabolism of fluorene by Arthrobacter sp.
1536,strain F101 proceeds through three independent pathways.
1537,"Two productive routes are initiated by dioxygenation at positions 1,2 and 3,4, respectively."
1538,meta cleavage followed by an aldolase reaction and loss of C-1 yield the detected indanones.
1539,"Subsequent biological Baeyer-Villiger reactions produce the aromatic lactones 3,4-dihydrocoumarin and 3-isochromanone."
1540,"Enzymatic hydrolysis of the former gives 3-(2-hydroxyphenyl) propionate, which could be a substrate for a beta oxidation cycle, to give salicylate."
1541,"Further oxidation of the latter via catechol and 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde connects with the central metabolism, allowing the utilization of all fluorene carbons."
1542,Identification of 4-hydroxy-9-fluorenone is consistent with an alternative pathway initiated by monooxygenation at C-9 to give 9-fluorenol and then 9-fluorenone.
1543,"Although dioxygenation at 3,4 positions of the ketone apparently occurs, this reaction fails to furnish a subsequent productive oxidation of this compound.We previously reported the isolation of a 21.5-kb genomic DNA fragment from Pseudomonas sp."

1547,"61:3373-3378, 1995)."
1548,"In this study, we show that this fragment also contained the second gene of the atrazine metabolic pathway, atzB."
1549,AtzB catalyzed the transformation of hydroxyatrazine to N-isopropylammelide.
1550,"The product was identified by use of high-performance liquid chromatography, mass spectrometery, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy."
1551,Tn5 mutagenesis of pMD1 was used to determine that atzB was located 8 kb downstream of atzA.
1552,"Hydroxyatrazine degradation activity was localized to a 4.0-kb ClaI fragment, which was subcloned into the vector pACYC184 to produce plasmid pATZB-2."
1553,"The DNA sequence of this region was determined and found to contain two large overlapping divergent open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2."
1554,ORF1 was identified as the coding region of atzB by demonstrating that (i) only ORF1 was transcribed in Pseudomonas sp.
1555,"strain ADP, (ii) a Tn5 insertion in ORF2 did not disrupt function, and (iii) codon usage was consistent with ORF1 being translated."
1556,"AtzB had 25% amino acid identity with TrzA, a protein that catalyzes a hydrolytic deamination of the s-triazine substrate melamine."
1557,"The atzA and atzB genes catalyze the first two steps of the metabolic pathway in a bacterium that rapidly metabolizes atrazine to carbon dioxide, ammonia, and chloride.Streptomyces viridifaciens MG456-hF10 produces the antitumor agent valanimycin, which is a member of a family of antibiotics containing the azoxy group."
1558,An enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of valanimycin has been purified 360-fold from S. viridifaciens.
1559,"This enzyme, isobutylamine N-hydroxylase, catalyzes the oxidation of isobutylamine to isobutylhydroxylamine in the presence of oxygen and a reduced flavin cofactor."
1560,"Unlike other known N-hydroxylases, isobutylamine N-hydroxylase cannot carry out the reduction of the flavin cofactor."
1561,"Rather, the reduced flavin is supplied by a separate flavin reductase that is present in extracts of S. viridifaciens."
1562,The reduced flavin cofactor could also be supplied by the flavin mononucleotide reductase of Vibrio fischeri.
1563,The requirement for molecular oxygen and a reduced flavin indicates that the N-hydroxylase is a flavin monooxygenase and that the mechanism for the hydroxylation is likely to proceed via the formation of a flavin 4a-hydroperoxide.
1564,Isobutylamine N-hydroxylase exhibited a subunit molecular mass of 40 kDa and existed in dimeric or trimeric form depending upon buffer conditions.
1565,The pI of the protein was found to be ca.

1567,"Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were given diets containing 0, 0.075, and 0.15% 2-MN for 81 weeks."
1568,"Both 0.075 and 0.15% 2-MN caused pulmonary alveolar proteinosis at high incidence: 55.1 and 45.8% in females and 42.9 and 46.9% in males, respectively."
1569,"The incidences of total lung tumors, including bronchiolar/alveolar adenomas and carcinomas, were 20.4 and 12.2% in male mice given 0.075 and 0.15% 2-MN, respectively, the former value being significantly increased compared with the 4."
1570,1% in control males.
1571,"However, in the respective incidences of the adenomas and carcinomas, neither intergroup differences nor dose dependencies were observed."
1572,The incidences of other tumors did not differ between mice treated with 2-MN and the controls.
1573,The results indicated that 2-MN induces pulmonary alveolar proteinosis but does not possess unequivocal carcinogenic potential in B6C3F1 mice.A recombinant Escherichia coli strain which expresses naphthalene dioxygenase (NDO) from Pseudomonas sp.
1574,"strain NCIB 9816-4 oxidized (S)-1-indanol to trans-(1S,3S)-indan-1,3-diol (95.5%) and (R)-3-hydroxy-1-indanone (4.5%)."
1575,"The same cells oxidized (R)-1-indanol to cis-1,3-indandiol (71%), (R)-3-hydroxy-1-indanone (18.2%), and cis-1,2,3-indantriol (10.8%)."
1576,"Purified NDO oxidized (S)-1-indenol to both syn- and anti-2,3-dihydroxy-1-indanol.Xanthobacter flavus 14p1 used 1,4-dichlorobenzene as the sole source of carbon and energy but did not grow on other (chloro)aromatic compounds."
1577,"1,4-Dichlorobenzene was attacked by a chlorobenzene dioxygenase, and the intermediate chlorocatechol was metabolized by the modified ortho pathway."
1578,"All enzymes necessary to convert 1, 4-dichlorobenzene to 3-oxoadipate showed a low substrate specificity and also accepted the respective intermediates of chlorobenzene or 1, 3-dichlorobenzene degradation."
1579,"Of the three compounds chlorobenzene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and 1,3-dichlorobenzene, the latter was the most toxic for X. flavus 14p1."
1580,"Furthermore, 1,3-dichlorobenzene did not induce chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase activity of the organism."
1581,"Chlorobenzene, however, induced chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase, dienelactone hydrolase, and maleylacetate reductase activities."
1582,"As demonstrated by chloride release, also chlorobenzene dioxygenase, chlorobenzene cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, and chloromuconate cycloisomerase activities were present in chlorobenzene-induced cells, but chlorobenzene failed to support growth."
1583,"Presumably a toxic compound was formed from one of the intermediates.Pseudomonas putida F1 utilizes p-cymene (p-isopropyltoluene) by an 11-step pathway through p-cumate (p-isopropylbenzoate) to isobutyrate, pyruvate, and acetyl coenzyme A."
1584,"The cym operon, encoding the conversion of p-cymene to p-cumate, is located just upstream of the cmt operon, which encodes the further catabolism of p-cumate and is located, in turn, upstream of the tod (toluene catabolism) operon in P. putida F1."
1585,"The sequences of an 11,236-bp DNA segment carrying the cym operon and a 915-bp DNA segment completing the sequence of the 2,673-bp DNA segment separating the cmt and tod operons have been determined and are discussed here."
1586,The cym operon contains six genes in the order cymBCAaAbDE.
1587,The gene products have been identified both by functional assays and by comparing deduced amino acid sequences to published sequences.
1588,"Thus, cymAa and cymAb encode the two components of p-cymene monooxygenase, a hydroxylase and a reductase, respectively; cymB encodes p-cumic alcohol dehydrogenase; cymC encodes p-cumic aldehyde dehydrogenase; cymD encodes a putative outer membrane protein related to gene products of other aromatic hydrocarbon catabolic operons, but having an unknown function in p-cymene catabolism; and cymE encodes an acetyl coenzyme A synthetase whose role in this pathway is also unknown."
1589,"Upstream of the cym operon is a regulatory gene, cymR."
1590,"By using recombinant bacteria carrying either the operator-promoter region of the cym operon or the cmt operon upstream of genes encoding readily assayed enzymes, in the presence or absence of cymR, it was demonstrated that cymR encodes a repressor which controls expression of both the cym and cmt operons and is inducible by p-cumate but not p-cymene."
1591,"Short (less than 350 bp) homologous DNA segments that are located upstream of cymR and between the cmt and tod operons may have been involved in recombination events that led to the current arrangement of cym, cmt, and tod genes in P. putida F1.The epoxide hydrolase gene from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1, a bacterium that is able to grow on epichlorohydrin as the sole carbon source, was cloned by means of the polymerase chain reaction with two degenerate primers based on the N-terminal and C-terminal sequences of the enzyme."
1592,The epoxide hydrolase gene coded for a protein of 294 amino acids with a molecular mass of 34 kDa.
1593,An identical epoxide hydrolase gene was cloned from chromosomal DNA of the closely related strain A. radiobacter CFZ11.
1594,The recombinant epoxide hydrolase was expressed up to 40% of the total cellular protein content in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and the purified enzyme had a kcat of 21 s-1 with epichlorohydrin.
1595,"Amino acid sequence similarity of the epoxide hydrolase with eukaryotic epoxide hydrolases, haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10, and bromoperoxidase A2 from Streptomyces aureofaciens indicated that it belonged to the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold family."
1596,This conclusion was supported by secondary structure predictions and analysis of the secondary structure with circular dichroism spectroscopy.
1597,"The catalytic triad residues of epoxide hydrolase are proposed to be Asp107, His275, and Asp246."
1598,"Replacement of these residues to Ala/Glu, Arg/Gln, and Ala, respectively, resulted in a dramatic loss of activity for epichlorohydrin."
1599,"The reaction mechanism of epoxide hydrolase proceeds via a covalently bound ester intermediate, as was shown by single turnover experiments with the His275 --> Arg mutant of epoxide hydrolase in which the ester intermediate could be trapped.Tetrachloroethene is a prominent groundwater pollutant that can be reductively dechlorinated by mixed anaerobic microbial populations to the nontoxic product ethene."
1600,"Strain 195, a coccoid bacterium that dechlorinates tetrachloroethene to ethene, was isolated and characterized."
1601,Growth of strain 195 with H2 and tetrachloroethene as the electron donor and acceptor pair required extracts from mixed microbial cultures.
1602,Growth of strain 195 was resistant to ampicillin and vancomycin; its cell wall did not react with a peptidoglycan-specific lectin and its ultrastructure resembled S-layers of Archaea.
1603,"Analysis of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequence of strain 195 indicated that it is a eubacterium without close affiliation to any known groups.Strain TEA, a strictly anaerobic, motile rod with one to four lateral flagella and a crystalline surface layer was isolated from a mixed culture that completely reduces chlorinated ethenes to ethene."
1604,"The organism coupled reductive dehalogenation of tetrachloroethene or trichloroethene to cis-1,2-dichloroethene to growth, using molecular hydrogen as the electron donor."
1605,"It was unable to grow fermentatively or in the presence of tri- or tetrachloroethene with glucose, pyruvate, lactate, acetate or formate."
1606,The 16S rDNA sequence of strain TEA was 99.7% identical to that of Dehalobacter restrictus.
1607,"The two organisms thus are representatives of the same species or the same genus within the Bacillus/Clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive bacteria.Past disposal of wastewaters containing 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) at the former Nebraska Ordnance Plant has resulted in numerous acres of TNT-contaminated soil."
1608,Examining the microbial population of these soils revealed several TNT-tolerant Pseudomonas spp.
1609,"We selected one species, P. savastanoi, to determine its ability to transform TNT."
1610,Pure culture experiments were performed in pseudomonas minimal medium containing 0.31 mM TNT (70 mg TNT .
1611,L(-1)) under varied nutrient and cell density regimes.
1612,"Experiments with TNT as a sole C or N source showed that P. savastanoi has the ability to denitrate TNT, as evidenced by production of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) and NO2- with time."
1613,"TNT denitration and formation of 2,4-DNT were enhanced by removing NH4+ and adding NO2- to the growth medium."
1614,"In all experiments, 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-ADNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT) appeared as incidental reduction products."
1615,Glucose addition to the medium enhanced 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT production and decreased denitration of TNT.
1616,"Mid-log phase cells rapidly transformed TNT but were unable to mineralize significant quantities of TNT, as evidenced by conversion of less than 1% of the label to 14CO2."
1617,"These results indicate that P. savastanoi is a TNT-tolerant pseudomonad that can promote TNT degradation through reductive denitration and nitro moiety reduction.Aspergillus niger, isolated from hydrocarbon-contaminated soil, was examined for its potential to degrade phenanthrene and pyrene."
1618,"Two novel metabolites, 1-methoxyphenanthrene and 1-methoxypyrene, were identified by conventional chemical techniques."
1619,Minor metabolites identified were 1- and 2-phenanthrol and 1-pyrenol.
1620,"No 14CO2 evolution was observed in either phenanthrene or pyrene cultures.The DNA fragment encoding meta-cleavage enzymes and the meta-cleavage compound hydrolase, involved in carbazole degradation, was cloned from the carbazole-utilizing bacterium Pseudomonas sp."
1621,strain CA10.
1622,"DNA sequence analysis of this 2.6-kb SmaI-SphI fragment revealed that there were three open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3, in this gene order)."
1623,"ORF1 and ORF2 were indispensable for meta-cleavage activity for 2\'-aminobiphenyl-2,3-diol and its easily available analog, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, and were designated carBa and carBb, respectively."
1624,The alignment of CarBb with other meta-cleavage enzymes indicated that CarBb may have a non-heme iron cofactor coordinating site.
1625,"On the basis of the phylogenetic tree, CarBb was classified as a member of the protocatechuate 4,5-dioxygenase family."
1626,"This unique extradiol dioxygenase, CarB, had significantly higher affinity and about 20-times-higher meta-cleavage activity for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl than for catechol derivatives."
1627,"The putative polypeptide encoded by ORF3 was homologous with meta-cleavage compound hydrolases in other bacteria, and ORF3 was designated carC."
1628,"The hydrolase activity of CarC for 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid, the meta-cleavage compound of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, was 40 times higher than that for 2-hydroxy-6-oxohepta-2,4-dienoic acid, the meta-cleavage compound of 3-methylcatechol."
1629,Alignment analysis and the phylogenetic tree indicate that CarC has greatest homologies with hydrolases involved in the monoaromatic compound degradation pathway.
1630,"These results suggest the possibility that CarC is a novel type of hydrolase.The degradation of thiodiglycol (I) and benzyl sulfide (II) was attempted using Coriolus versicolor and Tyromyces palustris to investigate the potential ability of basidiomycetes to degrade Yperite (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide), a mass-produced and stored chemical warfare agent."
1631,I was very rapidly degraded by both fungi.
1632,"The metabolic pathway of II was elucidated, showing that the initial step was the hydrolytic cleavage of the thioether bond to yield benzyl alcohol and benzyl mercaptan."
1633,Benzyl alcohol was further oxidized and finally mineralized.
1634,Benzyl mercaptan is reversibly converted to benzyl disulfide and also converted to benzyl alcohol.
1635,"Finally, the effective degradation of bis(2-bromoethyl) sulfide strongly suggests that basidiomycete would be a potential tool for Yperite degradation.Bacterium Sphingomonas sp."
1636,"strain RW1 is, under aerobic conditions, able to degrade dibenzofuran and dibenzo-p-dioxin."
1637,The first step of the pathway is performed by a ring-dihydroxylating enzyme.
1638,Bunz and Cook have reported the purification and characterization of this dioxin dioxygenase and a ferredoxin able to transfer electrons to the dioxygenase .
1639,The gene encoding this  ferredoxin was identified by screening a genomic library constructed in pLAFR3 with a probe generated by a nested-PCR amplification.
1640,Primers for the amplification were designed based on the N-terminus sequence of the purified ferredoxin and on sequence comparisons with related proteins.
1641,"Several cosmids were obtained and the ferredoxin gene, fdx1, was subcloned from one of them."
1642,The nucleotide sequence of a 4.6-kb DNA fragment encompassing the ferredoxin gene was determined.
1643,"While in the case of all known multi-component dioxygenases, genes encoding the alpha and beta subunits are found to be contiguous with the gene of the specific electron carrier, the fdx1 gene in Sphingomonas sp."
1644,RW1 does not appear to be directly linked with the dioxin dioxygenase genes.
1645,"Rather, it is clustered with genes apparently encoding two atypical decarboxylases/isomerases and a glutathione S-transferase."
1646,The ferredoxin gene was hyperexpressed and the recombinant ferredoxin was purified.
1647,Spectroscopic characterization of Fdx1 demonstrated the presence of a putidaredoxin-type  cluster in this protein.
1648,"Its redox potential was determined to be -245 (+/- 5) mV versus the normal hydrogen electrode at 25 degrees C, pH 8.0."
1649,"Therefore, the protein is closely related to  ferredoxins known to be electron donors to monooxygenases involved in hydroxylation of aromatic compounds."
1650,"Thus, this report provides clear evidence that a putidaredoxin-type  ferredoxin, namely Fdx1, is able to transfer electrons to the dioxin dioxygenase of Sphingomonas sp."
1651,"RW1.Several propane-oxidizing bacteria were tested for their ability to degrade gasoline oxygenates, including methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME)."
1652,Both a laboratory strain and natural isolates were able to degrade each compound after growth on propane.
1653,"When propane-grown strain ENV425 was incubated with 20 mg of uniformly labeled MTBE per liter, the strain converted > 60% of the added MTBE to 14CO2 in < 30 h. The initial oxidation of MTBE and ETBE resulted in the production of nearly stoichiometric amounts of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), while the initial oxidation of TAME resulted in the production of tert-amyl alcohol."
1654,The methoxy methyl group of MTBE was oxidized to formaldehyde and ultimately to CO2.
1655,"TBA was further oxidized to 2-methyl-2-hydroxy-1-propanol and then 2-hydroxy isobutyric acid; however, neither of these degradation products was an effective growth substrate for the propane oxidizers."
1656,Analysis of cell extracts of ENV425 and experiments with enzyme inhibitors implicated a soluble P-450 enzyme in the oxidation of both MTBE and TBA.
1657,"MTBE was oxidized to TBA by camphor-grown Pseudomonas putida CAM, which produces the well-characterized P-450cam, but not by Rhodococcus rhodochrous 116, which produces two P-450 enzymes."
1658,"Rates of MTBE degradation by propane-oxidizing strains ranged from 3.9 to 9.2 nmol/min/mg of cell protein at 28 degrees C, whereas TBA was oxidized at a rate of only 1.8 to 2.4 nmol/min/mg of cell protein at the same temperature.It has been suggested that catalase-peroxidase plays an important role in several aspects of mycobacterial metabolism and is a virulence factor in the main pathogenic mycobacteria."
1659,"In this investigation, we studied genes encoding for this protein in the fast-growing opportunistic pathogen Mycobacterium fortuitum."
1660,Nucleotide sequences of two different catalase-peroxidase genes (katGI and katGII) of M. fortuitum are described.
1661,"They show only 64% homology at the nucleotide level and 55% identity at the amino acid level, and they are more similar to catalases-peroxidases from different bacteria, including mycobacteria, than to each other."
1662,"Both proteins were found to be expressed in actively growing M. fortuitum, and both could also be expressed when transformed into Escherichia coli and M. aurum."
1663,We detected the presence of a copy of IS6100 in the neighboring region of a katG gene in the M. fortuitum strain in which this element was identified (strain FC1).
1664,The influence of each katG gene on isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide; INH) susceptibility of mycobacteria was checked by using the INH-sensitive M. aurum as the host.
1665,"Resistance to INH was induced when katGI was transformed into INH-sensitive M. aurum, suggesting that this enzyme contributes to the natural resistance of M. fortuitum to the drug."
1666,This is the first report showing two different genes encoding same enzyme activity which are actively expressed within the same mycobacterial strain.Two species of Pseudomonas capable of utilizing nitroglycerin (NG) as a sole nitrogen source were isolated from NG-contaminated soil and identified as Pseudomonas putida II-B and P. fluorescens I-C.
1667,"While 9 of 13 laboratory bacterial strains that presumably had no previous exposure to NG could degrade low concentrations of NG (0.44 mM), the natural isolates tolerated concentrations of NG that were toxic to the lab strains (1.76 mM and higher)."
1668,Whole-cell studies revealed that the two natural isolates produced different mixtures of the isomers of dinitroglycerol (DNG) and mononitroglycerol (MNG).
1669,"A monomeric, flavin mononucleotide-containing NG reductase was purified from each natural isolate."
1670,"These enzymes catalyzed the NADPH-dependent denitration of NG, yielding nitrite."
1671,Apparent kinetic constants were determined for both reductases.
1672,"The P. putida enzyme had a Km for NG of 52 +/- 4 microM, a Km for NADPH of 28 +/- 2 microM, and a Vmax of 124 +/- 6 microM x min(-1), while the P. fluorescens enzyme had a Km for NG of 110 +/- 10 microM, a Km for NADPH of 5 +/- 1 microM, and a Vmax of 110 +/- 11 microM x min(-1)."
1673,"Anaerobic titration experiments confirmed the stoichiometry of NADPH consumption, changes in flavin oxidation state, and multiple steps of nitrite removal from NG."
1674,The products formed during time-dependent denitration reactions were consistent with a single enzyme being responsible for the in vivo product distributions.
1675,"Simulation of the product formation kinetics by numerical integration showed that the P. putida enzyme produced an approximately 2-fold molar excess of 1,2-DNG relative to 1,3-DNG."
1676,This result could be fortuitous or could possibly be consistent with a random removal of the first nitro group from either the terminal (C-1 and C-3) positions or middle (C-2) position.
1677,"However, during the denitration of 1,2-DNG, a 1.3-fold selectivity for the C-1 nitro group was determined."
1678,Comparable simulations of the product distributions from the P. fluorescens enzyme showed that NG was denitrated with a 4.6-fold selectivity for the C-2 position.
1679,"Furthermore, a 2.4-fold selectivity for removal of the nitro group from the C-2 position of 1,2-DNG was also determined."
1680,"The MNG isomers were not effectively denitrated by either purified enzyme, which suggests a reason why NG could not be used as a sole carbon source by the isolated organisms.In this study, administration of pivalic acid or its sodium salt was found to decrease the L-carnitine concentration in the epididymal lumen of the hamster; it also tested whether this decrease affected sperm cell motility, chromatin structure, or fertilizing capacity."
1681,"Provision of pivalic acid or its sodium salt (20 mM or 40 mM) in the drinking water of mature male golden hamsters for 30 days reduced (by 72%, 75%, and 83% in three experiments) the L-carnitine concentration of the cauda epididymidis but did not inhibit sperm chromatin condensation, as assessed by flow cytometry."
1682,The treatments did not alter the location of motile sperm in the epididymidis nor did they appreciably affect the motility of sperm obtained from the distal cauda epididymidis.
1683,The numbers and percentage of ova that reached the 2-cell stage 36-40 h after uterine insemination with spermatozoa from control and treated hamsters served as a measure of sperm fertility.
1684,Treatment with pivalic acid or sodium pivalate did not render male hamsters infertile although it appeared to reduce the fertilizing ability of their spermatozoa.
1685,"These results suggest that the high concentration of L-carnitine present in the lumen of the cauda epididymidis is not required for maturation of sperm chromatin or development of sperm motility.Denitrification is a distinct means of energy conservation, making use of N oxides as terminal electron acceptors for cellular bioenergetics under anaerobic, microaerophilic, and occasionally aerobic conditions."
1686,"The process is an essential branch of the global N cycle, reversing dinitrogen fixation, and is associated with chemolithotrophic, phototrophic, diazotrophic, or organotrophic metabolism but generally not with obligately anaerobic life."
1687,"Discovered more than a century ago and believed to be exclusively a bacterial trait, denitrification has now been found in halophilic and hyperthermophilic archaea and in the mitochondria of fungi, raising evolutionarily intriguing vistas."
1688,"Important advances in the biochemical characterization of denitrification and the underlying genetics have been achieved with Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Paracoccus denitrificans, Ralstonia eutropha, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides."
1689,"Pseudomonads represent one of the largest assemblies of the denitrifying bacteria within a single genus, favoring their use as model organisms."
1690,Around 50 genes are required within a single bacterium to encode the core structures of the denitrification apparatus.
1691,"Much of the denitrification process of gram-negative bacteria has been found confined to the periplasm, whereas the topology and enzymology of the gram-positive bacteria are less well established."
1692,"The activation and enzymatic transformation of N oxides is based on the redox chemistry of Fe, Cu, and Mo."
1693,"Biochemical breakthroughs have included the X-ray structures of the two types of respiratory nitrite reductases and the isolation of the novel enzymes nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase, as well as their structural characterization by indirect spectroscopic means."
1694,This revealed unexpected relationships among denitrification enzymes and respiratory oxygen reductases.
1695,"Denitrification is intimately related to fundamental cellular processes that include primary and secondary transport, protein translocation, cytochrome c biogenesis, anaerobic gene regulation, metalloprotein assembly, and the biosynthesis of the cofactors molybdopterin and heme D1."
1696,An important class of regulators for the anaerobic expression of the denitrification apparatus are transcription factors of the greater FNR family.
1697,"Nitrate and nitric oxide, in addition to being respiratory substrates, have been identified as signaling molecules for the induction of distinct N oxide-metabolizing enzymes.Pseudomonas sp."
1698,"strain ADP metabolizes atrazine to cyanuric acid via three plasmid-encoded enzymes, AtzA, AtzB, and AtzC."
1699,"The first enzyme, AtzA, catalyzes the hydrolytic dechlorination of atrazine, yielding hydroxyatrazine."
1700,"The second enzyme, AtzB, catalyzes hydroxyatrazine deamidation, yielding N-isopropylammelide."
1701,"In this study, the third gene in the atrazine catabolic pathway, atzC, was cloned from a Pseudomonas sp."
1702,strain ADP cosmid library as a 25-kb EcoRI DNA fragment in Escherichia coli.
1703,The atzC gene was further delimited by functional analysis following transposon Tn5 mutagenesis and subcloned as a 2.0-kb EcoRI-AvaI fragment.
1704,"An E. coli strain containing this DNA fragment expressed N-isopropylammelide isopropylamino hydrolase activity, metabolizing N-isopropylammelide stoichiometrically to cyanuric acid and N-isopropylamine."
1705,"The 2.0-kb DNA fragment was sequenced and found to contain a single open reading frame of 1,209 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 403 amino acids."
1706,"AtzC showed modest sequence identity of 29 and 25%, respectively, to cytosine deaminase and dihydroorotase, both members of an amidohydrolase protein superfamily."
1707,The sequence of AtzC was compared to that of E. coli cytosine deaminase in the regions containing the five ligands to the catalytically important metal for the protein.
1708,Pairwise comparison of the 35 amino acids showed 61% sequence identity and 85% sequence similarity.
1709,"AtzC is thus assigned to the amidohydrolase protein family that includes cytosine deaminase, urease, adenine deaminase, and phosphotriester hydrolase."
1710,Similar sequence comparisons of the most highly conserved regions indicated that the AtzA and AtzB proteins also belong to the same amidohydrolase family.
1711,"Overall, the data suggest that AtzA, AtzB, and AtzC diverged from a common ancestor and, by random events, have been reconstituted onto an atrazine catabolic plasmid.Protoanemonin is a toxic metabolite which may be formed during the degradation of some chloroaromatic compounds, such as polychlorinated biphenyls, by natural microbial consortia."
1712,We show here that protoanemonin can be transformed by dienelactone hydrolase of Pseudomonas sp.
1713,strain B13 to cis-acetylacrylate.
1714,"Although similar Km values were observed for cis-dienelactone and protoanemonin, the turnover rate of protoanemonin was only 1% that of cis-dienelactone."
1715,"This indicates that at least this percentage of the enzyme is in the active state, even in the absence of activation."
1716,The trans-dienelactone hydrolase of Pseudomonas sp.
1717,strain RW10 did not detectably transform protoanemonin.
1718,"Obviously, Pseudomonas sp."
1719,"strain B13 possesses at least two mechanisms to avoid protoanemonin toxicity, namely a highly active chloromuconate cycloisomerase, which routes most of the 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate to the cis-dienelactone, thereby largely preventing protoanemonin formation, and dienelactone hydrolase, which detoxifies any small amount of protoanemonin that might nevertheless be formed.This article examines the importance of non-ligninolytic and ligninolytic fungi in the bioremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon contaminated wastes."
1720,"The research from the initial studies in Dave Gibson\'s laboratory to the present are discussed.A 2,585 bp chromosomal DNA segment of Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 (formerly: Alcaligenes eutrophus JMP134) which contains a gene cluster encoding part of the modified ortho-cleavage pathway encodes a putative transport protein for 4-methylmuconolactone, a novel 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase and methylmuconolactone isomerase."
1721,"The putative 4-methylmuconolactone transporter, a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 45.8 kDa, exhibits sequence homology to other members of the major superfamily of transmembrane facilitators and shows the common structural motif of 12 transmembrane-spanning alpha-helical segments and the hallmark amino acid motif characteristic of the superfamily."
1722,"Consistent with the novelty of the reaction catalyzed by 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase, no primary sequence homologies were found between this enzyme or its gene and other proteins or genes in the data banks, suggesting that this enzyme represents a new type of isomerase."
1723,The molecular mass of the native 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase was determined by gel filtration analysis to be 25 +/- 2 kDa.
1724,"From the polynucleotide sequence of the gene, a molecular mass of 12.9 kDa was calculated and hence we predict a homodimeric quaternary structure."
1725,The high sensitivity of 4-methylmuconolactone methylisomerase to heavy metals and thiol-modifying reagents implicates the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in the catalytic reaction.
1726,"The methylmuconolactone isomerase - calculated molecular mass 10.3 kDa - has a primary structure related to the classical muconolactone isomerases (EC 5.3.3.4) of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, of two Pseudomonas putida strains and of Ralstonia eutropha JMP134, suggesting that these are all isoenzymes."
1727,"Consistent with this proposal is the finding that the purified protein exhibits muconolactone-isomerizing activity.An immunological analysis of an Escherichia coli strain unable to synthesize the main pyruvate formate-lyase enzyme Pfl revealed the existence of a weak, cross-reacting 85 kDa polypeptide that exhibited the characteristic oxygen-dependent fragmentation typical of a glycyl radical enzyme."
1728,Polypeptide fragmentation of this cross-reacting species was shown to be dependent on Pfl activase.
1729,"Cloning and sequence analysis of the gene encoding this protein revealed that it coded for a new enzyme, termed TdcE, which has 82% identity with Pfl."
1730,"On the basis of RNA analyses, the tdcE gene was shown to be part of a large operon that included the tdcABC genes, encoding an anaerobic threonine dehydratase, tdcD, coding for a propionate kinase, tdcF, the function of which is unknown, and the tdcG gene, which encodes a L-serine dehydratase."
1731,Expression of the tdcABCDEFG operon was strongly catabolite repressed.
1732,"Enzyme studies showed that TdcE has both pyruvate formate-lyase and 2-ketobutyrate formate-lyase activity, whereas the TdcD protein is a new propionate/acetate kinase."
1733,"By monitoring culture supernatants from various mutants using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we followed the anaerobic conversion of L-threonine to propionate."
1734,"These studies confirmed that 2-ketobutyrate, the product of threonine deamination, is converted in vivo by TdcE to propionyl-CoA."
1735,These studies also revealed that Pfl and an as yet unidentified thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme(s) can perform this reaction.
1736,"Double null mutants deficient in phosphotransacetylase (Pta) and acetate kinase (AckA) or AckA and TdcD were unable to metabolize threonine to propionate, indicating that propionyl-CoA and propionyl-phosphate are intermediates in the pathway and that ATP is generated during the conversion of propionyl-P to propionate by AckA or TdcD.A nitroalkane-oxidizing enzyme was purified to homogeneity from Neurospora crassa."
1737,"The enzyme is composed of two subunits; the molecular weight of each subunit is approximately 40,000."
1738,The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of nitroalkanes to produce the corresponding carbonyl compounds.
1739,"It acts on 2-nitropropane better than on nitroethane and 1-nitropropane, and anionic forms of nitroalkanes are much better substrates than are neutral forms."
1740,The enzyme does not act on aromatic compounds.
1741,"When the enzyme reaction was conducted in an 18O2 atmosphere with the anionic form of 2-nitropropane as the substrate, acetone (with a molecular mass of 60 Da) was produced."
1742,"This indicates that the oxygen atom of acetone was derived from molecular oxygen, not from water; hence, the enzyme is an oxygenase."
1743,"The reaction stoichiometry was 2CH3CH(NO2)CH3 + O2-->2CH3COCH3 + 2HNO2, which is identical to that of the reaction of 2-nitropropane dioxygenase from Hansenula mrakii."
1744,The reaction of the Neurospora enzyme was inhibited by superoxide anion scavengers in the same manner as that of the Hansenula enzyme.
1745,"Both of these enzymes are flavoenzymes; however, the Neurospora enzyme contains flavin mononucleotide as a prosthetic group, whereas the Hansenula enzyme contains flavin adenine dinucleotide.A gram-negative bacterium was isolated from activated sewage sludge with thiophene-2-carboxylate as the sole source of carbon and with nitrate as an electron acceptor."
1746,"The isolate, strain NKK, was a motile, oxidase- and catalase-positive, rod-like bacterium with a G+C content of 61.7 mol%."
1747,"Besides nitrate, oxygen could serve as a terminal electron acceptor."
1748,"Among many carbon sources tested, only a few sugars, fatty acids, and thiophene-2-carboxylate supported growth."
1749,Other heterocyclic compounds were not used.
1750,"The sulfur atom of thiophene-2-carboxylate was oxidized to thiosulfate when cells were grown aerobically, or to elemental sulfur when cells were grown anaerobically with nitrate."
1751,Nitrate was reduced to nitrite.
1752,Growth on thiophene-2-carboxylate was dependent on the addition of molybdate to the medium.
1753,"Tungstate, a specific antagonist of molybdate, inhibited growth on thiophene-2-carboxylate at concentrations > 10(-7) M. Three inducible enzymes involved in the metabolism of thiophene-2-carboxylate were detected: an ATP-, CoA-, thiophene-2-carboxylate- and Mg2+-dependent thiophene-2-carboxyl-CoA ligase (AMP-forming), a molybdenum-containing thiophene-2-carboxyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and a thiophene-2-carboxyl-CoA thioesterase."
1754,"The sequence of the 16S rRNA gene suggested a classification of strain NKK within the alpha-subgroup of the Proteobacteria as a new genus and species, Aquamicrobium defluvii gen. nov. sp."
1755,"nov. (DSM 11603), closely related to Mesorhizobium sp."
1756,"and Phyllobacterium sp., but representing a distinct lineage equal in depth to those of the two mentioned genera."
1757,"Aquamicrobium defluvii can be distinguished from both genera by a distinct spectrum of substrates, the maximal growth temperature, and a different salt tolerance.acenaphthene, a tracer compound with a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-active nucleus at the C-1 position, has been employed in conjunction with a standard broad-band-decoupled 13C-NMR spectroscopy technique to study the biodegradation of acenaphthene by various bacterial cultures degrading aromatic hydrocarbons of creosote."
1758,Site-specific labeling at the benzylic position of acenaphthene allows 13C-NMR detection of chemical changes due to initial oxidations catalyzed by bacterial enzymes of aromatic hydrocarbon catabolism.
1759,Biodegradation of acenaphthene in the presence of naphthalene or creosote polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) was examined with an undefined mixed bacterial culture (established by enrichment on creosote PACs) and with isolates of individual naphthalene- and phenanthrene-degrading strains from this culture.
1760,"From 13C-NMR spectra of extractable materials obtained in time course biodegradation experiments under optimized conditions, a number of signals were assigned to accumulated products such as 1-acenaphthenol, 1-acenaphthenone, acenaphthene-1,2-diol and naphthalene 1,8-dicarboxylic acid, formed by benzylic oxidation of acenaphthene and subsequent reactions."
1761,"Limited degradation of acenaphthene could be attributed to its oxidation by naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase or related dioxygenases, indicative of certain limitations of the undefined mixed culture with respect to acenaphthene catabolism."
1762,Coinoculation of the mixed culture with cells of acenaphthene-grown strain Pseudomonas sp.
1763,strain A2279 mitigated the accumulation of partial transformation products and resulted in more complete degradation of acenaphthene.
1764,"This study demonstrates the value of the stable isotope labeling approach and its ability to reveal incomplete mineralization even when as little as 2 to 3% of the substrate is incompletely oxidized, yielding products of partial transformation."
1765,"The approach outlined may prove useful in assessing bioremediation performance.Alachlor, metolachlor, and propachlor are detoxified in biological systems by the formation of glutathione-acetanilide conjugates."
1766,"This conjugation is mediated by glutathione-S-transferase, which is present in microorganisms, plants, and mammals."
1767,"Other organic sulfides and inorganic sulfide also react through a nucleophilic attack on the 2-chloro group of acetanilide herbicides, but the products are only partially characterized."
1768,"Sorption in soils and sediments is an important factor controlling the migration and bioavailability of these herbicides, while microbial degradation is the most important factor in determining their overall fate in the environment."
1769,"The biodegradation of alachlor and metolachlor is proposed to be only partial and primarily cometabolic, and the ring cleavage seems to be slow or insignificant."
1770,Propachlor biodegradation has been reported to proceed to substantial (> 50%) mineralization of the ring structure.
1771,Reductive dechlorination may be one of the initial breakdown mechanisms under anaerobic conditions.
1772,Aerobic and anaerobic transformation products vary in their polarity and therefore in soil binding coefficient.
1773,A catabolic pathway for chloroacetanilide herbicides has not been presented in the literature because of the lack of mineralization data under defined cultural conditions.DDT is reductively dechlorinated to DDD and dehydrochlorinated to DDE; it has been thought that DDE is not degraded further in the environment.
1774,Laboratory experiments with DDE-containing marine sediments showed that DDE is dechlorinated to DDMU in both methanogenic and sulfidogenic microcosms and that DDD is dehydrochlorinated to DDMU three orders of magnitude more slowly.
1775,"Thus, DDD does not appear to be an important precursor of the DDMU found in these sediments."
1776,"These results imply that remediation decisions and risk assessments based on the recalcitrance of DDE in marine and estuarine sediments should be reevaluated.1,1-Dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), a toxic breakdown product of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT), has traditionally been viewed as a dead-end metabolite: there are no published reports detailing enzymatic ring fission of DDE by bacteria in either soil or pure culture."
1777,"In this study, we investigated the ability of Pseudomonas acidovorans M3GY to transform DDE and its unchlorinated analog, 1,1-diphenylethylene (DPE)."
1778,"While strain M3GY could grow on DPE, cells grown on DPE as a sole carbon source could not degrade DDE."
1779,"Cells grown on biphenyl, however, did degrade DDE."
1780,Mass balance analysis of DDE showed transformation of more than 40% of the recoverable radioactivity.
1781,Nine chlorinated metabolites produced from DDE were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (GC-MS-FTIR) from cultures grown on biphenyl.
1782,Recovery of these metabolites demonstrates that biphenyl-grown cells degrade DDE through a meta-fission pathway.
1783,This study provides a possible model for biodegradation of DDE in soil by biphenyl-utilizing bacteria.A bacterial strain (strain S5) which grows aerobically with the sulfonated azo compound 4-carboxy-4\'-sulfoazobenzene as the sole source of carbon and energy was isolated.
1784,"This strain was obtained by continuous adaptation of ""Hydrogenophaga palleronii"" S1, which has the ability to grow aerobically with 4-aminobenzenesulfonate."
1785,"Strain S5 probably cleaves 4-carboxy-4\'-sulfoazobenzene reductively under aerobic conditions to 4-aminobenzoate and 4-aminobenzene-sulfonate, which are mineralized by previously established degradation pathways.We have identified, cloned, and sequenced the hca cluster encoding the dioxygenolytic pathway for initial catabolism of 3-phenylpropionic acid (PP) in Escherichia coli K-12."
1786,This cluster maps at min 57.5 of the chromosome and is composed of five catabolic genes arranged as a putative operon (hcaA1A2CBD) and two additional genes transcribed in the opposite direction that encode a potential permease (hcaT) and a regulator (hcaR).
1787,"Sequence comparisons revealed that while hcaA1A2CD genes encode the four subunits of the 3-phenylpropionate dioxygenase, the hcaB gene codes for the corresponding cis-dihydrodiol dehydrogenase."
1788,This type of catabolic module is homologous to those encoding class IIB dioxygenases and becomes the first example of such a catabolic cluster in E. coli.
1789,"The inducible expression of the hca genes requires the presence of the hcaR gene product, which acts as a transcriptional activator and shows significant sequence similarity to members of the LysR family of regulators."
1790,"Interestingly, the HcaA1A2CD and HcaB enzymes are able to oxidize not only PP to 3-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)propionate (DHPP) but also cinnamic acid (CI) to its corresponding 2, 3-dihydroxy derivative."
1791,"Further catabolism of DHPP requires the mhp-encoded meta fission pathway for the mineralization of 3-hydroxyphenylpropionate (3HPP) (A. Ferr\xc3\xa1ndez, J. L. Garc\xc3\xada, and E. D\xc3\xadaz, J. Bacteriol."
1792,"179:2573-2581, 1997)."
1793,"Expression in Salmonella typhimurium of the mhp genes alone or in combination with the hca cluster allowed the growth of the recombinant bacteria in 3-hydroxycinnamic acid (3HCI) and CI, respectively."
1794,"Thus, the convergent mhp- and hca-encoded pathways are also functional in S. typhimurium, and they are responsible for the catabolism of different phenylpropanoid compounds (3HPP, 3HCI, PP, and CI) widely available in nature.Metabolism of carbofuran in pure liquid cultures of A. niger and F. graminearum was investigated."
1795,Carbofuran and its metabolites were analyzed by HPLC and TLC.
1796,"The average recoveries of carbofuran, 3-hydroxycarbofuran, 3-ketocarbofuran, and 3-ketocarbofuran phenol from fungi media were found to be 88.65, 86.19, 75.48, and 80.48%, while their detection limits were 0.035, 0.031, 0.015 and 0.140 ppm, respectively."
1797,The data showed that A. niger was capable of degrading carbofuran more faster than F. graminearum.
1798,Carbofuran disappeared biexponentially from the liquid culture media of both fungi.
1799,"The terminal half-life values of carbofuran were 10.4 and 12 days in the media of A. niger and F. graminearum, respectively."
1800,"The amounts of carbofuran reached 15.56 and 19.71% of the applied dose after 21 days in case of A. niger and F. graminearum, respectively."
1801,"Carbofuran was biotransformed to 3-hydroxycarbofuran, 3-ketocarbofuran, and 3-ketocarbofuran phenol."
1802,"The percentages of the major metabolite, 3-hydroxycarbofuran were 47.72 and 7.77% in case of A. niger and F. graminearum after 21 days, respectively.The development of biocatalytic desulfurization of petroleum fractions may allow its use in place of conventional hydrodesulfurization (HDS)."
1803,Dibenzothiophene (DBT) is representative of a broad range of sulfur heterocycles found in petroleum that are recalcitrant to desulfurization via HDS.
1804,Rhodococcus sp.
1805,strain IGTS8 has the ability to convert DBT to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (HBP) with the release of inorganic sulfur.
1806,The conversion of DBT to HBP is catalyzed by a multienzyme pathway consisting of two monooxygenases and a desulfinase.
1807,The final reaction catalyzed by the desulfinase appears to be the rate limiting step in the pathway.
1808,Each of the enzymes has been purified to homogeneity and their kinetic and physical properties studied.
1809,Neither monooxygenase has a tightly bound cofactor and each requires an NADH-FMN oxidoreductase for activity.
1810,"An NADH-FMN oxidoreductase has been purified from Rhodococcus and is a protein of approximately 25,000 molecular weight with no apparent sequence homology to any other protein in the databases."
1811,"We describe a unique sulfur acquisition system that Rhodococcus uses to obtain sulfur from very stable heterocyclic molecules.The biochemistry of the 13 steps involved in the conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate and acetylCoA to alpha-ketosuberate, a precursor to the coenzymes coenzyme B (7-mercapto heptanoylthreonine phosphate) and biotin, has been established in Methanosarcina thermophila."
1812,These series of reactions begin with the condensation of alpha-ketoglutarate and acetylCoA to form trans-homoaconitate.
1813,The trans-homoaconitate is then hydrated and dehydrated to cis-homoaconitate with (S)-homocitrate serving as an intermediate.
1814,"Rehydration of the cis-homoaconitate produces (-)-threo-isohomocitrate , which undergoes a NADP+-dependent oxidative decarboxylation to produce alpha-ketoadipate."
1815,The resulting alpha-ketoadipate then undergoes two consecutive sets of alpha-ketoacid chain elongation reactions to produce alpha-ketosuberate.
1816,"In each of these sets of reactions, it has been shown that the homologues of cis-homoaconitate, homocitrate, and (-)-threo-isohomocitrate serve as intermediates."
1817,The protein product of the Methanococcus jannaschii MJ0503 gene aksA (AksA) was found to catalyze the condensation of alpha-ketoglutarate and acetylCoA to form trans-homoaconitate.
1818,"This gene product also catalyzed the condensation of alpha-ketoadipate or alpha-ketopimelate with acetylCoA to form, respectively, the (R)-homocitrate homologues of (R)-2-hydroxy-1,2,5-pentanetricarboxylic acid and (R)-2-hydroxy-1,2, 6-hexanetricarboxylic acid."
1819,"The alpha-ketosuberate resulting from this series of reactions then undergoes a nonoxidative decarboxylation to form 7-oxoheptanoic acid, a precursor to coenzyme B, and an oxidative decarboxylation to form pimelate, the precursor to biotin."
1820,"Of the 13 intermediates in this pathway, eight have not previously been reported as occurring in biological systems.2-Hydroxyisonicotinate dehydrogenase from Mycobacterium sp."
1821,INA1 was purified 26-fold to apparent homogeneity.
1822,The enzyme is involved in isonicotinate degradation by Mycobacterium sp.
1823,"INA1 and catalyzes the conversion of 2-hydroxyisonicotinate to 2,6-dihydroxypyridine-4-carboxylate."
1824,"The purified protein exhibited a native molecular mass of 300 kDa and subunits of 97, 31 and 17 kDa, respectively, indicating an alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2 structure."
1825,"The absorption spectrum of the homogeneous enzyme was characteristic for an iron/sulfur flavoprotein, 3.8 mol of iron, 3.7 mol of acid labile sulfur, 0.94 mol of FAD and 0.75 mol of molybdenum were determined per mol of protomer."
1826,The molybdenum cofactor was identified as molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide.
1827,2-Hydroxyisonicotinate dehydrogenase was inactivated in the presence of cyanide.
1828,According to these basic properties the protein seems to belong to the class of molybdo-iron/sulfur flavoproteins of the xanthine oxidase family.A bacterial strain capable of utilizing E-pyridine-3-aldoxime as a nitrogen source was isolated from soil after a 4-month acclimation period and was identified as Rhodococcus sp.
1829,The strain contained a novel aldoxime dehydration activity that catalyzed a stoichiometric dehydration of E-pyridine-3-aldoxime to form 3-cyanopyridine.
1830,The enzyme activity was induced by various aldoximes and nitriles.
1831,"The strain metabolized the aldoxime as follows: E-pyridine-3-aldoxime was dehydrated to form 3-cyanopyridine, which was converted to nicotinamide by a nitrile hydratase, and the nicotinamide was successively hydrolyzed to nicotinic acid by an amidase.Enterobacter cloacae PB2 was originally isolated on the basis of its ability to utilize nitrate esters, such as pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and glycerol trinitrate, as the sole nitrogen source for growth."
1832,The enzyme responsible is an NADPH-dependent reductase designated PETN reductase.
1833,"E. cloacae PB2 was found to be capable of slow aerobic growth with 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) as the sole nitrogen source."
1834,Dinitrotoluenes were not produced and could not be used as nitrogen sources.
1835,"Purified PETN reductase was found to reduce TNT to its hydride-Meisenheimer complex, which was further reduced to the dihydride-Meisenheimer complex."
1836,Purified PETN reductase and recombinant Escherichia coli expressing PETN reductase were able to liberate nitrogen as nitrite from TNT.
1837,"The ability to remove nitrogen from TNT suggests that PB2 or recombinant organisms expressing PETN reductase may be useful for bioremediation of TNT-contaminated soil and water.The gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas cichorii 170, isolated from soil that was repeatedly treated with the nematocide 1, 3-dichloropropene, could utilize low concentrations of 1, 3-dichloropropene as a sole carbon and energy source."
1838,"Strain 170 was also able to grow on 3-chloroallyl alcohol, 3-chloroacrylic acid, and several 1-halo-n-alkanes."
1839,"This organism produced at least three different dehalogenases: a hydrolytic haloalkane dehalogenase specific for haloalkanes and two 3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenases, one specific for cis-3-chloroacrylic acid and the other specific for trans-3-chloroacrylic acid."
1840,"The haloalkane dehalogenase and the trans-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase were expressed constitutively, whereas the cis-3-chloroacrylic acid dehalogenase was inducible."
1841,"The presence of these enzymes indicates that 1, 3-dichloropropene is hydrolyzed to 3-chloroallyl alcohol, which is oxidized in two steps to 3-chloroacrylic acid."
1842,"The latter compound is then dehalogenated, probably forming malonic acid semialdehyde."
1843,"The haloalkane dehalogenase gene, which is involved in the conversion of 1,3-dichloropropene to 3-chloroallyl alcohol, was cloned and sequenced, and this gene turned out to be identical to the previously studied dhaA gene of the gram-positive bacterium Rhodococcus rhodochrous NCIMB13064."
1844,"Mutants resistant to the suicide substrate 1,2-dibromoethane lacked haloalkane dehalogenase activity and therefore could not utilize haloalkanes for growth."
1845,"PCR analysis showed that these mutants had lost at least part of the dhaA gene.Nylon-6, a man-made polymer that finds its application in the manufacture of car tires, ropes, fabrics, automobile parts etc., is manufactured with epsilon-caprolactam."
1846,Waste water generated during production of nylon-6 contains the unreacted monomer.
1847,"Owing to the polluting and toxic nature of epsilon-caprolactam, its removal from waste streams is necessary."
1848,Pseudomonas aeruginosa MCM B-407 was isolated from activated sludge used to treat waste from a factory producing nylon-6.
1849,This organism was able to remove epsilon-caprolactam with simultaneous reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD).
1850,"The degradation of epsilon-caprolactam in waste water was found to be optimal over a wide range of pH from 5.0 to 9.0, temperature of 30 degrees C, and under shake or aerated conditions, with an inoculum density of 10(5) cells/ml and with an incubation period of 24 - 48 h. Thus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MCM B-407 isolated from the activated sludge exposed to epsilon-caprolactam may play an important role in the bioremediation of epsilon-caprolactam from the waste waters of industries manufacturing nylon-6.For the last 40 y, substantial evidence has surfaced on the hormone-like effects of environmental chemicals such as pesticides and industrial chemicals in wildlife and humans."
1851,"The endocrine and reproductive effects of these chemicals are believed to be due to their ability to: (1) mimic the effect of endogenous hormones, (2) antagonize the effect of endogenous hormones, (3) disrupt the synthesis and metabolism of endogenous hormones, and (4) disrupt the synthesis and metabolism of hormone receptors."
1852,The discovery of hormone-like activity of these chemicals occurred long after they were released into the environment.
1853,"Aviation crop dusters handling DDT were found to have reduced sperm counts, and workers at a plant producing the insecticide kepone were reported to have lost their libido, became impotent and had low sperm counts."
1854,"Subsequently, experiments conducted in lab animals demonstrated unambiguously the estrogenic activity of these pesticides."
1855,Man-made compounds used in the manufacture of plastics were accidentally found to be estrogenic because they fouled experiments conducted in laboratories studying natural estrogens.
1856,"For example, polystyrene tubes released nonylphenol, and polycarbonate flasks released bisphenol-A."
1857,Alkylphenols are used in the synthesis of detergents (alkylphenol polyethoxylates) and as antioxidants.
1858,"These detergents are not estrogenic; however, upon degradation during sewage treatment they may release estrogenic alkylphenols."
1859,The surfactant nonoxynol is used as intravaginal spermicide and condom lubricant.
1860,When administered to lab animals it is metabolized to free nonylphenol.
1861,Bisphenol-A was found to contaminate the contents of canned foods; these tin cans are lined with lacquers such as polycarbonate.
1862,Bisphenol-A is also used in dental sealants and composites.
1863,We found that this estrogen leaches from the treated teeth into saliva; up to 950 microg of bisphenol-A were retrieved from saliva collected during the first hour after polymerization.
1864,"Other xenoestrogens recently identified among chemicals used in large volumes are the plastizicers benzylbutylphthalate, dibutylphthalate, the antioxidant butylhydroxyanisole, the rubber additive p-phenylphenol and the disinfectant o-phenylphenol."
1865,These compounds act cumulatively.
1866,"In fact, feminized male fish were found near sewage outlets in several rivers in the U.K.; a mixture of chemicals including alkyl phenols resulting from degradation of detergents during sewage treatment seemed to be the causal agent."
1867,Estrogen mimics are just a class of endocrine disruptors.
1868,"Recent studies identified antiandrogenic activity in environmental chemicals such as vinclozolin, a fungicide, and DDE, and insecticide."
1869,"Moreover, a single chemical may produce neurotoxic, estrogenic and antiandrogenic effects."
1870,"It has been hypothesized that endocrine disruptors may play a role in the decrease in the quantity and quality of human semen during the last 50 y, as well as in the increased incidence of testicular cancer and cryptorchidism in males and breast cancer incidence in both females and males in the industrialized word."
1871,To explore this hypothesis it is necessary to identify putative causal agents by the systematic screening of environmental chemicals and chemicals present in human foods to assess their ability to disrupt the endocrine system.
1872,"In addition, it will be necessary to develop methods to measure cumulative exposure to (a) estrogen mimics, (b) antiandrogens, and (c) other disruptors.A new oxidative pathway for the degradation of caffeine(1,3,7-Trimethylxanthine, I) by a mixed culture consisting of strains belonging to the genera Klebsiella and Rhodococcus is presented."
1873,"The mixed culture does not initiate degradation by N-demethylation either complete or partial, but instead carries out oxidation at the C-8 position resulting in the formation of 1,3,7-trimethyluric acid (TMU, II) which further gets degraded to 3,6,8-trimethylallantoin (TMA, III)."
1874,Both TMU and TMA are hitherto not shown to be formed in the microbial system.
1875,Further degradation of TMA (III) by caffeine grown cells yields dimethylurea (VII) as one of the metabolites.
1876,"Oxygen uptake studies indicated that caffeine(I) grown cells oxidized TMU(II), TMA (III), glyoxalic acid (VI), dimethylurea(VII), and monomethylurea(V), but not monomethyl and dimethyluric acids."
1877,"The mixed culture does not accept theophylline(1,3-dimethylxanthine), theobromine(3,7-dimethylxanthine), and paraxanthine(1,7-dimethylxanthine) as the carbon source.Higher fungi have a widespread capacity for biosynthesis of organohalogens."
1878,Commonly occurring chloroaromatic fungal metabolites can end up in anaerobic microniches at the boundary of fungal colonies and wetland soils.
1879,"The aim of this study was to investigate the environmental fate of a major fungal metabolite, 3, 5-dichloro-p-anisyl alcohol, under anaerobic conditions."
1880,This compound was incubated with methanogenic sludge to study its biotransformation reactions.
1881,"Initially, 3,5-dichloro-p-anisyl alcohol was readily demethylated in stoichiometric quantities to 3, 5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol."
1882,"The demethylated product was converted further via two routes: a biotic route leading to the formation of 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate and 2,6-dichlorophenol, as well as an abiotic route leading to the formation of bis(3, 5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)methane."
1883,"In the first route, the benzyl alcohol moiety on the aromatic ring was oxidized, giving 3, 5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate as a transient or accumulating product, depending on the type of methanogenic sludge used."
1884,"In sludge previously adapted to low-molecular-weight lignin from straw, a part of the 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate was decarboxylated, yielding detectable levels of 2,6-dichlorophenol."
1885,"In the second route, 3, 5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol dimerized, leading to the formation of a tetrachlorinated bisphenolic compound, which was identified as bis(3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxyphenyl)methane."
1886,"Since formation of this dimer was also observed in incubations with autoclaved sludge spiked with 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, it was concluded that its formation was due to an abiotic process."
1887,"However, demethylation of the fungal metabolite by biological processes was a prerequisite for dimerization."
1888,"The most probable reaction mechanism leading to the formation of the tetrachlorinated dimer in the absence of oxygen is presented, and the possible environmental implications of its natural occurrence are discussed.Benzothiazole-2-sulfonate (BTSO3) is one of the side products occurring in 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) production wastewater."
1889,We are the first to isolate an axenic culture capable of BTSO3 degradation.
1890,"The isolate was identified as a Rhodococcus erythropolis strain and also degraded 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (OBT) and benzothiazole (BT), but not MBT, which was found to inhibit the biodegradation of OBT, BT, and BTSO3."
1891,"In anaerobic resting cell assays, BTSO3 was transformed into OBT in stoichiometric amounts."
1892,"Under aerobic conditions, OBT was observed as an intermediate in BT breakdown and an unknown compound transiently accumulated in several assays."
1893,This product was identified as a dihydroxybenzothiazole.
1894,"Benzothiazole degradation pathways seem to converge into OBT, which is then transformed further into the dihydroxy derivative.Pseudomonas chlororaphis RW71 mineralized 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene, a highly recalcitrant pollutant hitherto not known to be degraded by pure cultures, as a sole source of carbon and energy, thereby releasing stoichiometric amounts of chloride."
1895,The transient excretion of tetrachlorocatechol in the early growth phase suggests an initial attack by a dioxygenase to form the corresponding dihydrodiol which rearomatizes to the catechol.
1896,"The activity of chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase in crude cell extracts was found to be extraordinarily high towards 3-chlorocatechol (ratio of 2.6 compared to catechol) and other chlorocatechols, including tetrachlorocatechol, which was transformed at a low but significant rate."
1897,"Further identification of tetrachloromuconic acid, 2,3, 5-trichlorodienelactone, 2,3,5-trichloromaleyl acetic acid, and 2, 4-dichloro-3-oxoadipic acid as their methyl esters, together with high specific enzyme activities for chlorinated substrates, implicated a functioning chlorocatechol pathway to be induced during growth.A Citrobacter sp."
1898,originally isolated from metal-polluted soil accumulates heavy metals via metalphosphate deposition utilizing inorganic phosphate liberated via PhoN phosphatase activity.
1899,Further strain development was limited by the non-transformability of this environmental isolate.
1900,"Recombinant Escherichia coli DH5 alpha bearing cloned phoN or the related phoC acquired metal-accumulating ability, which was compared with that of the Citrobacter sp."
1901,with respect to removal of uranyl ion (UO2(2+)) from dilute aqueous flows and its deposition in the form of polycrystalline hydrogen uranyl phosphate (HUO2PO4).
1902,"Subsequently, HUO2PO4-laden cells removed Ni2+ from dilute aqueous flows via intercalation of Ni2+ into the HUO2PO4 lattice."
1903,"Despite comparable acid phosphatase activity in all three strains, the E. coli DH5 alpha (phoN) construct was superior to Citrobacter N14 in both uranyl and nickel accumulation, while the E. coli DH5 alpha (phoC) construct was greatly inferior in both respects."
1904,"Expression of phosphatase activity alone is not the only factor that permits efficient and prolonged metal phosphate accumulation, and the data highlight possible differences in the PhoN and PhoC phosphatases, which are otherwise considered to be related in many respects.Gordona sp."
1905,"strain 213E (NCIMB 40816) grew in pure culture in a mineral salts medium containing fructose as a source of carbon and energy, and benzothiophene (BTH) as the sole source of sulphur."
1906,"During growth a phenolic compound accumulated, as indicated by the production of a blue colour on addition of Gibb\'s reagent."
1907,Therefore this pathway is analogous to the dibenzothiophene (DBT) desulphurization pathway of Rhodococcus sp.
1908,"strain IGTS8, in which 2-hydroxybiphenyl accumulates during growth with DBT as the sole sulphur source."
1909,"Ethyl acetate extraction of the culture medium yielded the metabolites benzothiophene s-oxide (BTHO), benzothiophene s,s-dioxide (BTHO2), benzooxathiin 6-oxide (BcOTO), 2-(2\'-hydroxyphenyl) ethan 1-al (HPEal) and benzofuran (BFU)."
1910,The deduced pathway for BTH desulphurization is BTH-->BTHO-->BTHO2-->HPESi(-)-->HPEal.
1911,"HPESi- is (Z)-2-(2\'-hydroxyphenyl)ethen 1-sulphinate, the stable aqueous-solution form of BcOTO."
1912,"It was concluded that HPEal was the Gibb\'s-reagent-reactive phenolic compound which accumulated in the culture medium of strain 213E during growth, and that the presence of BFU was due to partial condensation of HPEal during the ethyl acetate extraction procedure."
1913,Gordona sp.
1914,strain 213E was unable to grow in a mineral salts medium containing fructose as a source of carbon and energy and DBT as the sole sulphur source.
1915,BTH-desulphurization-active cells (grown using BTH as sole sulphur source) were unable to desulphurize DBT.
1916,Likewise Rhodococcus sp.
1917,"strain IGTS8 was unable to grow using BTH as the sole sulphur source, and DBT-desulphurization-active cells of strain IGTS8 (grown using DBT as sole sulphur source) were unable to desulphurize BTH."
1918,This absence of cross-reactivity is discussed in terms of fundamental differences in the chemistry of the DBT- and BTH-desulphurization reactions.N-Methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) is capable of dissolving cellulose without any further addition of chemicals.
1919,The solution can be used to produce cellulosic staple fibres by pressing it through spinning jets into an aqueous spinning bath.
1920,"Because of results from conventional biodegradation tests using non-adapted activated sludge, the solvent is generally considered being persistent."
1921,"The object of the described work was to show, whether and how activated sludge can be adapted to N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide and whether it is possible to purify NMMO-containing wastewaters in conventional wastewater treatment plants."
1922,The experiments showed that the sludge can be adapted within about 15-20 days.
1923,Adapted sludge can degrade the substance itself and its most important metabolites to concentrations below their detection levels and retain this ability even during limited periods without solvent being present in the wastewater.
1924,The main requirement for a successful adaptation is a high sludge age.
1925,The degradation takes place in several steps.
1926,"First, NMMO is reduced to N-methylmorpholine."
1927,The next step is a demethylation of N-methylmorpholine to morpholine.
1928,This step is crucial for the adaptation process.
1929,"Once morpholine has been formed, the adaptation proceeds very quickly until none of the substances in question can be detected any longer."
1930,"So the next step must be the cleavage of the morpholine ring structure.The monoterpenes menthol, linalool, and eucalyptol were recently used as sole electron donor and carbon source for the isolation of three denitrifying bacterial strains 21Mol, 47Lol, and 58Eu."
1931,"The motile, mesophilic, Gram-negative rods had a strictly respiratory metabolism."
1932,"Monoterpenes were completely mineralised to carbon dioxide, nitrate was reduced to dinitrogen."
1933,"Strain 47Lol utilised aliphatic monoterpenes, strain 21Mol oxygenated monocyclic monoterpenes, and strain 58Eu the bicyclic eucalyptol and monocyclic monoterpene alkenes."
1934,The fatty acid composition of the strains indicated an allocation to the rRNA group III of pseudomonads.
1935,Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses revealed that the new isolates can be assigned as members of the genus Thauera within the beta subclass of Proteobacteria.
1936,DNA-DNA hybridisation studies indicated a relateness of 68.5% between strains 21Mol and 58Eu which shared 36.0% and 40.6% DNA similarity with strain 47Lol.
1937,"The strains are described as new species belonging to the genus Thauera, strain 47Lol (DSM 12138T) as T. linaloolentis sp."

1940,"Recently, we found a new glycogenolytic pathway in rat liver in which glycogen is first metabolized to 1, 5-anhydrofructose (AnFru) and then to 1,5-anhydroglucitol (AnGlc-ol)."
1941,"Because the amounts of glycogen and AnFru are closely related in various rat organs and the second reaction, AnFru to AnGlc-ol, is strongly inhibited in the presence of glucose, we expected that this pathway might play a regulatory role in glycogen metabolism."
1942,Here we evaluate the expected involvement of AnGlc-ol and AnFru in the regulatory mechanism in Escherichia coli C600.
1943,"Having established the presence of this new glycogenolytic pathway in E. coli C600, we further show that the conversion of AnFru to AnGlc-ol is activated only after the exhaustion of glucose in the medium, and that as little as 5 microM AnGlc-ol in the medium acutely accelerates the degradation of glycogen by 40%."
1944,We consider the role of AnGlc-ol in the mechanism that controls glycogen metabolism in E. coli to be as follows.
1945,"When glucose is abundant, E. coli accumulate glycogen, a fraction of which is steadily degraded so that the amount of AnFru is about 1/1,000 of glycogen on a weight basis."
1946,"When glucose is depleted and the demand for glycogen utilization is elevated, AnFru, which has accumulated mostly in the medium, is promptly taken up and converted to AnGlc-ol, which accelerates glycogen degradation."
1947,We also suggest the possibility that AnGlc-ol is one of the extracellular signaling molecules for bacteria.Propachlor (2-chloro-N-isopropylacetanilide) is an acetamide herbicide used in preemergence.
1948,"In this study, we isolated and characterized a soil bacterium, Acinetobacter strain BEM2, that was able to utilize this herbicide as the sole and limiting carbon source."
1949,Identification of the intermediates of propachlor degradation by this strain and characterization of new metabolites in the degradation of propachlor by a previously reported strain of Pseudomonas (PEM1) support two different propachlor degradation pathways.
1950,"Washed-cell suspensions of strain PEM1 with propachlor accumulated N-isopropylacetanilide, acetanilide, acetamide, and catechol."
1951,Pseudomonas strain PEM1 grew on propachlor with a generation time of 3.4 h and a Ks of 0.17 +/- 0.04 mM.
1952,Acinetobacter strain BEM2 grew on propachlor with a generation time of 3.1 h and a Ks of 0.3 +/- 0.07 mM.
1953,"Incubations with strain BEM2 resulted in accumulation of N-isopropylacetanilide, N-isopropylaniline, isopropylamine, and catechol."
1954,"Both degradative pathways were inducible, and the principal product of the carbon atoms in the propachlor ring was carbon dioxide."
1955,These results and biodegradation experiments with the identified metabolites indicate that metabolism of propachlor by Pseudomonas sp.
1956,strain PEM1 proceeds through a different pathway from metabolism by Acinetobacter sp.
1957,"strain BEM2.Biodegradation of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid) by Rhodococcus erythropolis HLPM-1 proceeds via initial hydrogenation of the aromatic ring system."
1958,Here we present evidence for the formation of a hydride-Meisenheimer complex (anionic sigma-complex) of picric acid and its protonated form under physiological conditions.
1959,These complexes are key intermediates of denitration and productive microbial degradation of picric acid.
1960,"For comparative spectroscopic identification of the hydride complex, it was necessary to synthesize this complex for the first time."
1961,Spectroscopic data revealed the initial addition of a hydride ion at position 3 of picric acid.
1962,"This hydride complex readily picks up a proton at position 2, thus forming a reactive species for the elimination of nitrite."

1982,"To show that the reaction was really catalyzed by a single enzyme without the release of intermediates, the corresponding protein was purified to apparent homogeneity from an extract of cells grown on 3-nitrophenol as the nitrogen source and succinate as the carbon and energy source."
1983,3-Hydroxylaminophenol mutase appears to be a relatively hydrophobic but soluble and colorless protein consisting of a single 62-kDa polypeptide.
1984,The pI was determined to be at pH 4.5.
1985,"In a database search, the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the undigested protein and of two internal sequences of 3-hydroxylaminophenol mutase were found to be most similar to those of glutamine synthetases from different species."
1986,"Hydroxylaminobenzene, 4-hydroxylaminotoluene, and 2-chloro-5-hydroxylaminophenol, but not 4-hydroxylaminobenzoate, can also serve as substrates for the enzyme."
1987,"The enzyme requires no oxygen or added cofactors for its reaction, which suggests an enzymatic mechanism analogous to the acid-catalyzed Bamberger rearrangement.There are only a few examples of microbial conversion of picric acid (2,4,6-trinitrophenol)."
1988,"None of the organisms that have been described previously is able to use this compound as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy at high rates."

2006,"In the present study, using a model of INH-induced hepatotoxicity in rabbits, pretreatment of rabbits with the amidase inhibitor bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate 30 min before injection of INH inhibited the formation of INH-derived hydrazine and decreased measures of hepatocellular damage, hepatic triglyceride accumulation, and hypertriglyceridemia."

2024,"The opposite enantiomers  were found in the (4S)-limonene degradation pathway, while accumulation of (1R,2S,4S)-limonene-1,2-diol from (4S)-limonene was also observed."
2025,"These results show that R. erythropolis DCL14 metabolizes both enantiomers of limonene via a novel degradation pathway that starts with epoxidation at the 1,2 double bond forming limonene-1,2-epoxide."
2026,"This epoxide is subsequently converted to limonene-1,2-diol, 1-hydroxy-2-oxolimonene, and 7-hydroxy-4-isopropenyl-7-methyl-2-oxo-oxepanone."
2027,This lactone spontaneously rearranges to form 3-isopropenyl-6-oxoheptanoate.
2028,"In the presence of coenzyme A and ATP this acid is converted further, and this finding, together with the high levels of isocitrate lyase activity in extracts of limonene-grown cells, suggests that further degradation takes place via the beta-oxidation pathway.The microbial degradation of low-molecular-weight polydimethylsiloxanes was investigated through laboratory experiments."

2046,"Epoxyalkane carboxylation requires four enzymes (components I-IV), NADPH, NAD(+), and a previously unidentified nucleophilic thiol."
2047,"In the present work, coenzyme M (2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid), a compound previously found only in the methanogenic Archaea where it serves as a methyl group carrier and activator, has been identified as the thiol and central cofactor of aliphatic epoxide carboxylation in the Gram-negative bacterium Xanthobacter strain Py2."
2048,"Component I catalyzed the addition of coenzyme M to epoxypropane to form a beta-hydroxythioether, 2-(2-hydroxypropylthio)ethanesulfonate."
2049,Components III and IV catalyzed the NAD(+)-dependent stereoselective dehydrogenation of R- and S-enantiomers of 2-(2-hydroxypropylthio)ethanesulfonate to form 2-(2-ketopropylthio)ethanesulfonate.
2050,"Component II catalyzed the NADPH-dependent cleavage and carboxylation of the beta-ketothioether to form acetoacetate and coenzyme M. These findings evince a newfound versatility for coenzyme M as a carrier and activator of alkyl groups longer in chain-length than methane, a function for coenzyme M in a catabolic pathway of hydrocarbon oxidation, and the presence of coenzyme M in the bacterial domain of the phylogenetic tree."

2061,"A mutant derived from this strain (W51M1) is unable to degrade citronellol but still grows on B-DBS, showing that the citronellol degradation route is not the main pathway involved in the degradation of the surfactant alkyl moiety."
2062,"The structures of the main B-DBS isomers and of some intermediates were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis, and a possible catabolic route is proposed.Pseudomonas stutzeri strain KC was originally characterized as having, under iron-limiting conditions, novel carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) dehalogenation activity, specifically, a net conversion of CCl(4) to CO(2)."
2063,"The exact pathway and reaction mechanisms are unknown, but chloroform is not an intermediate and thiophosgene and phosgene have been identified as intermediates in trapping experiments."
2064,Previous work by others using cell-free preparations has shown that cell-free culture supernatants that have been passed through a low-molecular-weight cutoff membrane can confer rapid CCl(4) transformation ability upon cultures of bacteria which otherwise show little or no reactivity toward CCl(4).

2070,"While the amino acid sequence identity is 75-80% among the alpha-1, 4-glucan lyases from each of the taxonomic groups, the identity between the algal and fungal alpha-1,4-glucan lyases is only 25-28%."
2071,"Notably database searches disclosed that the alpha-1,4-glucan lyases have a clear identity of 23-28% with alpha-glucosidases of glycoside hydrolase family 31, thus for the first time linking enzymes from the class of hydrolases with that of lyases."
2072,"The alignment of lyases and alpha-glucosidases revealed seven well-conserved regions, three of which have been reported to be involved in catalysis and substrate binding in alpha-glucosidases."
2073,"The shared substrate and inhibitor specificity and sequence similarity of alpha-1,4-glucan lyases with alpha-glucosidases suggest that related structural elements are involved in the two different catalytic mechanisms.Menthol is widely used in a variety of commercial products and foods, but its clinical pharmacology is not well studied."
2074,"To determine the disposition kinetics and to examine subjective and cardiovascular effects of menthol, we conducted a crossover placebo-controlled study that compared pure menthol versus placebo, along with an uncontrolled exposure to menthol in food or beverage."
2075,A novel assay for the measurement of menthol in biological fluids was also developed.Trihalogenated propanes are toxic and recalcitrant organic compounds.
2076,Attempts to obtain pure bacterial cultures able to use these compounds as sole carbon and energy sources were unsuccessful.
2077,Both the haloalkane dehalogenase from Xanthobacter autotrophicus GJ10 (DhlA) and that from Rhodococcus sp.
2078,"strain m15-3 (DhaA) were found to dehalogenate trihalopropanes to 2,3-dihalogenated propanols, but the kinetic properties of the latter enzyme are much better."
2079,"Broad-host-range dehalogenase expression plasmids, based on RSF1010 derivatives, were constructed with the haloalkane dehalogenase from Rhodococcus sp."
2080,"strain m15-3 under the control of the heterologous promoters P(lac), P(dhlA), and P(trc)."
2081,The resulting plasmids yielded functional expression in several gram-negative bacteria.
2082,"A catabolic pathway for trihalopropanes was designed by introducing these broad-host-range dehalogenase expression plasmids into Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1, which has the ability to utilize dihalogenated propanols for growth."
2083,"The recombinant strain AD1(pTB3), expressing the haloalkane dehalogenase gene under the control of the dhlA promoter, was able to utilize both 1,2,3-tribromopropane and 1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane as sole carbon sources."
2084,"Moreover, increased expression of the haloalkane dehalogenase resulted in elevated resistance to trihalopropanes.Two strains of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA)-degrading bacteria, TA5 and TA27, were isolated from soil and identified as Mycobacterium spp."
2085,"Strains TA5 and TA27 could degrade 25 and 75 mg. liter of TCA(-1) cometabolically in the presence of ethane as a carbon source, respectively."
2086,"The compound 2,2,2-trichloroethanol was produced as a metabolite of the degradation process.The genes encoding flavin mononucleotide-containing oxidoreductases, designated xenobiotic reductases, from Pseudomonas putida II-B and P. fluorescens I-C that removed nitrite from nitroglycerin (NG) by cleavage of the nitroester bond were cloned, sequenced, and characterized."
2087,"The P. putida gene, xenA, encodes a 39,702-Da monomeric, NAD(P)H-dependent flavoprotein that removes either the terminal or central nitro groups from NG and that reduces 2-cyclohexen-1-one but did not readily reduce 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT)."
2088,"The P. fluorescens gene, xenB, encodes a 37,441-Da monomeric, NAD(P)H-dependent flavoprotein that exhibits fivefold regioselectivity for removal of the central nitro group from NG and that transforms TNT but did not readily react with 2-cyclohexen-1-one."
2089,Heterologous expression of xenA and xenB was demonstrated in Escherichia coli DH5alpha.
2090,The transcription initiation sites of both xenA and xenB were identified by primer extension analysis.
2091,BLAST analyses conducted with the P. putida xenA and the P. fluorescens xenB sequences demonstrated that these genes are similar to several other bacterial genes that encode broad-specificity flavoprotein reductases.
2092,"The prokaryotic flavoprotein reductases described herein likely shared a common ancestor with old yellow enzyme of yeast, a broad-specificity enzyme which may serve a detoxification role in antioxidant defense systems.Oxyanions of arsenic and selenium can be used in microbial anaerobic respiration as terminal electron acceptors."
2093,The detection of arsenate and selenate respiring bacteria in numerous pristine and contaminated environments and their rapid appearance in enrichment culture suggest that they are widespread and metabolically active in nature.
2094,"Although the bacterial species that have been isolated and characterized are still few in number, they are scattered throughout the bacterial domain and include Gram-positive bacteria, beta, gamma and epsilon Proteobacteria and the sole member of a deeply branching lineage of the bacteria, Chrysiogenes arsenatus."
2095,The oxidation of a number of organic substrates (i.e.
2096,"acetate, lactate, pyruvate, glycerol, ethanol) or hydrogen can be coupled to the reduction of arsenate and selenate, but the actual donor used varies from species to species."
2097,Both periplasmic and membrane-associated arsenate and selenate reductases have been characterized.
2098,"Although the number of subunits and molecular masses differs, they all contain molybdenum."
2099,"The extent of the environmental impact on the transformation and mobilization of arsenic and selenium by microbial dissimilatory processes is only now being fully appreciated.Environmental contamination with compounds containing oxyanions of chlorine, such as perchlorate or chlorate  or chlorine dioxide, has been a constantly growing problem over the last 100 years."
2100,"Although the fact that microbes reduce these compounds has been recognized for more than 50 years, only six organisms which can obtain energy for growth by this metabolic process have been described."
2101,"As part of a study to investigate the diversity and ubiquity of microorganisms involved in the microbial reduction of (per)chlorate, we enumerated the (per)chlorate-reducing bacteria (ClRB) in very diverse environments, including pristine and hydrocarbon-contaminated soils, aquatic sediments, paper mill waste sludges, and farm animal waste lagoons."
2102,"In all of the environments tested, the acetate-oxidizing ClRB represented a significant population, whose size ranged from 2.31 x 10(3) to 2.4 x 10(6) cells per g of sample."
2103,"In addition, we isolated 13 ClRB from these environments."
2104,All of these organisms could grow anaerobically by coupling complete oxidation of acetate to reduction of (per)chlorate.
2105,Chloride was the sole end product of this reductive metabolism.
2106,"All of the isolates could also use oxygen as a sole electron acceptor, and most, but not all, could use nitrate."
2107,"The alternative electron donors included simple volatile fatty acids, such as propionate, butyrate, or valerate, as well as simple organic acids, such as lactate or pyruvate."
2108,"Oxidized-minus-reduced difference spectra of washed whole-cell suspensions of the isolates had absorbance maxima close to 425, 525, and 550 nm, which are characteristic of type c cytochromes."
2109,"In addition, washed cell suspensions of all of the ClRB isolates could dismutate chlorite, an intermediate in the reductive metabolism of (per)chlorate, into chloride and molecular oxygen."
2110,"Chlorite dismutation was a result of the activity of a single enzyme which in pure form had a specific activity of approximately 1,928 micromol of chlorite per mg of protein per min."
2111,"Analyses of the 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of the organisms indicated that they all belonged to the alpha, beta, or gamma subclass of the Proteobacteria."
2112,"Several were closely related to members of previously described genera that are not recognized for the ability to reduce (per)chlorate, such as the genera Pseudomonas and Azospirllum."
2113,"However, many were not closely related to any previously described organism and represented new genera within the Proteobacteria."
2114,The results of this study significantly increase the limited number of microbial isolates that are known to be capable of dissimilatory (per)chlorate reduction and demonstrate the hitherto unrecognized phylogenetic diversity and ubiquity of the microorganisms that exhibit this type of metabolism.Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a general biocide and a major environmental pollutant.
2115,The initial steps of PCP degradation by Sphingomonas chlorophenolica ATCC 39723 have been studied and characterized.
2116,"Two enzymes are responsible for converting PCP to 2, 6-dichloro-p-hydroquinone (2,6-DiCH) which is a common metabolic intermediate of the biodegradation of polychlorinated phenols."
2117,"2, 6-DiCH is degraded by PcpA from strain ATCC 39723, but the reaction end product has been misidentified as 6-chlorohydroxyquinol and has been elusive to detection."
2118,"We report here the overproduction of PcpA in Escherichia coli and the demonstration of quantitative conversion of 2,6-DiCH to 2-chloromaleylacetate with the coconsumption of one equivalent O(2) and release of one equivalent Cl(-) by purified PcpA."
2119,"On the basis of the reaction stoichiometry, the enzyme is proposed to be 2,6-DiCH 1,2-dioxygenase.A unique enzyme, MMA(V) reductase, has been partially purified from rabbit liver by using DEAE-cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, and red dye ligand chromatography."
2120,The enzyme is unique since it is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biotransformation of inorganic arsenite in rabbit liver.
2121,The K(m) and V(max) values were 2.16 x 10(-)(3) M and 10.3 micromol h(-)(1) (mg of protein)(-)(1).
2122,"When DMA(V) or arsenate was tested as a substrate, the K(m) was 20.9 x 10(-)(3) or 109 x 10(-)(3) M, respectively."
2123,The enzyme has an absolute requirement for GSH.
2124,Other thiols such as DTT or L-cysteine were inactive alone.
2125,"At a pH below the physiological pH, GSH carried out this reduction, but this GSH reduction in the absence of the enzyme had little if any value at pH 7.4."
2126,"When the K(m) values of rabbit liver arsenite methyltransferase (5.5 x 10(-)(6) M) and MMA(III) methyltransferase (9.2 x 10(-)(6)) were compared to that of MMA(V) reductase (2.16 x 10(-)(3) M), it can be concluded that MMA(V) reductase was the rate-limiting enzyme of inorganic arsenite biotransformation."
2127,"MMA(V) reductase was also present in surgically removed human liver.An Arthrobacter protophormiae strain RKJ100, isolated by selective enrichment, was capable of utilizing o-nitrobenzoate (ONB(+)) as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source."
2128,The degradation of ONB proceeds through an oxygen insensitive reductive route as shown by the release of ammonia in the culture medium aerobically rather than nitrite ions.
2129,"Thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the intermediates have shown that ONB is degraded by a two-electron reduction of the nitro moiety, yielding o-hydroxylaminobenzoate and anthranilic acid."
2130,"Quantitation of the intermediates, inhibition studies, and simultaneous induction studies have shown that anthranilic acid is produced as the terminal aromatic intermediate of a catabolic energy-yielding pathway and not as a side reaction taking place concurrently which is the first such report."
2131,A plasmid of approximately 65 kb was found to be responsible for harboring genes for ONB degradation in this strain.
2132,"The same plasmid also encoded resistance to cobalt ions.Anaerobic transformations of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), 1,1-dichloroethane (DCA), and chloroethane (CA) were studied with sludge from a lab-scale, municipal wastewater sludge digester."
2133,TCA was biologically transformed to DCA and CA and further to ethane by reductive dechlorination.
2134,"TCA was also converted to acetic acid and 1,1-dichloroethene (11DCE) by cell-free extract."
2135,11DCE was further biologically converted to ethene.
2136,"This pathway was confirmed by transformation tests of TCA, DCA and CA, by tests with cell-free extract, and by chloride release during TCA degradation."
2137,"With cell-free extract, acetic acid accounted for approximately 90% of the TCA transformed; tests with live cells indicate that the fraction of TCA transformed by this pathway decreased with lower biomass."
2138,The dechlorination of DCA to CA and CA to ethane was not stoichiometric.
2139,A high rate of TCA removal was observed under the experimental conditions.
2140,"The results indicate that removal of TCA in anaerobic digestion should be complete, but DCA and CA could persist in a normally operating digester.The thermophilic aerobic bacterium Bacillus thermoleovorans Hamburg 2 grows at 60 degrees C on naphthalene as the sole source of carbon and energy."
2141,"In batch cultures, an effective substrate degradation was observed."
2142,"The carbon balance, including naphthalene, metabolites, biomass, and CO(2), was determined by the application of naphthalene."
2143,The incorporation of naphthalene-derived carbon into the bulk biomass as well as into specified biomass fractions such as fatty acids and amino acids was confirmed by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and isotope analyses.
2144,Metabolites were characterized by GC-MS; the established structures allow tracing the degradation pathway under thermophilic conditions.
2145,"Apart from typical metabolites of naphthalene degradation known from mesophiles, intermediates such as 2, 3-dihydroxynaphthalene, 2-carboxycinnamic acid, and phthalic and benzoic acid were identified for the pathway of this bacterium."
2146,"These compounds indicate that naphthalene degradation by the thermophilic B. thermoleovorans differs from the known pathways found for mesophilic bacteria.This study investigated the biodegradation of high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in liquid media and soil by bacteria (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia VUN 10,010 and bacterial consortium VUN 10,009) and a fungus (Penicillium janthinellum VUO 10, 201) that were isolated from separate creosote- and manufactured-gas plant-contaminated soils."
2147,The bacteria could use pyrene as their sole carbon and energy source in a basal salts medium (BSM) and mineralized significant amounts of benzopyrene cometabolically when pyrene was also present in BSM.
2148,"P. janthinellum VUO 10,201 could not utilize any high-molecular-weight PAH as sole carbon and energy source but could partially degrade these if cultured in a nutrient broth."
2149,"Although small amounts of chrysene, benzanthracene, benzopyrene, and dibenzanthracene were degraded by axenic cultures of these isolates in BSM containing a single PAH, such conditions did not support significant microbial growth or PAH mineralization."
2150,"However, significant degradation of, and microbial growth on, pyrene, chrysene, benzanthracene, benzopyrene, and dibenzanthracene, each as a single PAH in BSM, occurred when P. janthinellum VUO 10,201 and either bacterial consortium VUN 10,009 or S. maltophilia VUN 10,010 were combined in the one culture, i.e., fungal-bacterial cocultures: 25% of the benzopyrene was mineralized to CO(2) by these cocultures over 49 days, accompanied by transient accumulation and disappearance of intermediates detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography."
2151,"Inoculation of fungal-bacterial cocultures into PAH-contaminated soil resulted in significantly improved degradation of high-molecular-weight PAHs, benzopyrene mineralization (53% of added benzopyrene was recovered as (14)CO(2) in 100 days), and reduction in the mutagenicity of organic soil extracts, compared with the indigenous microbes and soil amended with only axenic inocula.A bacterial strain capable of growing on propachlor (2-chloro-N-isopropylacetanilide) was isolated from soil by using enrichment and isolation techniques."
2152,"The strain isolated, designated GCH1, was classified as a member of the genus Pseudomonas."
2153,"Washed-cell suspensions of strain GCH1 accumulated N-isopropylacetanilide, acetanilide, acetamide, and catechol."
2154,Pseudomonas strain GCH1 grew on propachlor with a generation time of 4.2 h and a rate of substrate utilization of 1.75 +/- 0.15 micromol h(-1).
2155,Gene expression did not require induction but was subject to catabolite expression.
2156,Acetanilide was a growth substrate with a yield of 0.56 +/- 0.02 mg of protein micromol(-1).
2157,GCH1 strain cells were immobilized by adsorption onto a ceramic support and were used as biocatalysts in an immobilized cell system.
2158,"Propachlor elimination reached 98%, with a retention time of 3 h and an initial organic load of 0.5 mM propachlor."
2159,"The viability of immobilized cells increased 34-fold after 120 days of bioreactor operation.Many enteric bacteria express a type I oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase, which reduces nitro groups on many different nitroaromatic compounds under aerobic conditions."
2160,Enzymatic reduction of nitramines was also documented in enteric bacteria under anaerobic conditions.
2161,"This study indicates that nitramine reduction in enteric bacteria is carried out by the type I, or oxygen-insensitive nitroreductase, rather than a type II enzyme."
2162,"The enteric bacterium Morganella morganii strain B2 with documented hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) nitroreductase activity, and Enterobacter cloacae strain 96-3 with documented 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) nitroreductase activity, were used here to show that the explosives TNT and RDX were both reduced by a type I nitroreductase."
2163,Morganella morganii and E. cloacae exhibited RDX and TNT nitroreductase activities in whole cell assays.
2164,"Type I nitroreductase, purified from E. cloacae, oxidized NADPH with TNT or RDX as substrate."
2165,"When expression of the E. cloacae type I nitroreductase gene was induced in an Escherichia coli strain carrying a plasmid, a simultaneous increase in TNT and RDX nitroreductase activities was observed."
2166,"In addition, neither TNT nor RDX nitroreductase activity was detected in nitrofurazone-resistant mutants of M. morganii."
2167,"We conclude that a type I nitroreductase present in these two enteric bacteria was responsible for the nitroreduction of both types of explosive.Arthrobacter protophormiae strain RKJ100 is capable of utilizing p-nitrophenol (PNP) as well as 4-nitrocatechol (NC) as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy."
2168,"The degradation of PNP and NC by this microorganism takes place through an oxidative route, as stoichiometry of nitrite molecules was observed when the strain was grown on PNP or NC as sole carbon and energy sources."
2169,"The degradative pathways of PNP and NC were elucidated on the basis of enzyme assays and chemical characterization of the intermediates by TLC, GC, (1)H NMR, GC-MS, UV spectroscopy, and HPLC analyses."
2170,Our studies clearly indicate that the degradation of PNP proceeds with the formation of p-benzoquinone (BQ) and hydroquinone (HQ) and is further degraded via the beta-ketoadipate pathway.
2171,"Degradation of NC involved initial oxidation to generate 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT) and 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone; the latter intermediate is then reductively dehydroxylated, forming BQ and HQ, and is further cleaved via beta-ketoadipate to TCA intermediates."
2172,"It is likely, therefore, that the same set of genes encode the further metabolism of HQ in PNP and NC degradation."
2173,A plasmid of approximately 65 kb was found to be responsible for harboring genes for PNP and NC degradation in this strain.
2174,"This was based on the fact that PNP(-) NC(-) derivatives were devoid of the plasmid and had simultaneously lost their capability to grow at the expense of these nitroaromatic compounds.Deinococcus radiodurans is an exceptionally radiation-resistant microorganism capable of surviving acute exposures to ionizing radiation doses of 15,000 Gy and previously described as having a strictly aerobic respiratory metabolism."
2175,"Under strict anaerobic conditions, D. radiodurans R1 reduced Fe(III)-nitrilotriacetic acid coupled to the oxidation of lactate to CO(2) and acetate but was unable to link this process to growth."
2176,"D. radiodurans reduced the humic acid analog anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) to its dihydroquinone form, AH(2)DS, which subsequently transferred electrons to the Fe(III) oxides hydrous ferric oxide and goethite via a previously described electron shuttle mechanism."
2177,D. radiodurans reduced the solid-phase Fe(III) oxides in the presence of either 0.1 mM AQDS or leonardite humic acids (2 mg ml(-1)) but not in their absence.
2178,D. radiodurans also reduced U(VI) and Tc(VII) in the presence of AQDS.
2179,"In contrast, Cr(VI) was directly reduced in anaerobic cultures with lactate although the rate of reduction was higher in the presence of AQDS."
2180,The results are the first evidence that D. radiodurans can reduce Fe(III) coupled to the oxidation of lactate or other organic compounds.
2181,"Also, D. radiodurans, in combination with humic acids or synthetic electron shuttle agents, can reduce U and Tc and thus has potential applications for remediation of metal- and radionuclide-contaminated sites where ionizing radiation or other DNA-damaging agents may restrict the activity of more sensitive organisms.Study of the conversion of chlorophenols by Rhodococcus opacus 1G, R. rhodnii 135, R. rhodochrous 89, and R. opacus 1cp disclosed the dependence of the conversion rate and pathway on the number and position of chlorine atoms in the aromatic ring."
2182,"The most active chlorophenol converter, strain R. opacus 1cp, grew on each of the three isomeric monochlorophenols and on 2,4-dichlorophenol; the rate of growth decreased from 4-chlorophenol to 3-chlorophenol and then to 2-chlorophenol."
2183,"The parameters of growth on 2,4-dichlorophenol were the same as on 3-chlorophenol."
2184,None of the strains studied utilized trichlorophenols.
2185,"A detailed study of the pathway of chlorophenol transformation showed that 3-chloro-, 4-chloro-, and 2,4-dichlorophenol were utilized by the strains via a modified ortho-pathway."
2186,"2-Chlorophenol and 2,3-dichlorophenol were transformed by strains R. opacus 1cp and R. rhodochrous 89 via corresponding 3-chloro- and 3,4-dichloropyrocatechols, which were then hydroxylated with the formation of 4-chloropyrogallol and 4,5-dichloropyrogallol; this route had not previously been described in bacteria."
2187,"Phenol hydroxylase of R. opacus 1G exhibited a previously undescribed catalytic pattern, catalyzing oxidative dehalogenation of 2,3,5-trichlorophenol with the formation of 3,5-dichloropyrocatechol but not hydroxylation of the nonsubstituted position 6.Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes POB310 contains genes that encode phenoxybenzoate dioxygenase."
2188,The enzyme transforms mono- and dichlorinated phenoxybenzoates to yield protocatechuate that is used as a growth substrate and chlorophenols that are nonmetabolizable.
2189,"Mass spectral analysis of (18)O metabolites obtained from the protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase-deficient mutant, POB310-B1, suggested that the reaction mechanism is a regioselective angular dioxygenation."
2190,A cloning vector containing reaction relevant genes (pD30.9) was transferred into Pseudomonas sp.
2191,strain B13 containing a modified ortho-cleavage pathway for aromatic compounds.
2192,The resultant Pseudomonas sp.
2193,strain B13-D5 (pD30.9) completely metabolized 3-(4-chlorophenoxy)benzoate.
2194,"During growth on 3-phenoxybenzoate, strain B13-D5 (pD30.9) (K(s) = 0.70+/-0.04 mM, mu(max) = 0.45+/-0.03 h(-1), t(d) = 1.5 h, Y = 0.45+/-0.03 g bio- mass x g substrate(-1)) was better adapted to low substrate concentrations, had a faster rate of growth, and a greater yield than POB310 (K(s) = 1.13+/-0.06 mM, mu(max) = 0.31+/-0.02 h(-1), t(d) = 2.2 h, Y = 0.39+/-0.02 g biomass."
2195,"g substrate(-1)).Biotransformation products of hydroxylaminobenzene and aminophenol produced by 3-nitrophenol-grown cells of Pseudomonas putida 2NP8, a strain grown on 2- and 3-nitrophenol, were characterized."
2196,"Ammonia, 2-aminophenol, 4-aminophenol, 4-benzoquinone, N-acetyl-4-aminophenol, N-acetyl-2-aminophenol, 2-aminophenoxazine-3-one, 4-hydroquinone, and catechol were produced from hydroxylaminobenzene."
2197,"Ammonia, N-acetyl-2-aminophenol, and 2-aminophenoxazine-3-one were produced from 2-aminophenol."
2198,"All of these metabolites were also found in the nitrobenzene transformation medium, and this demonstrated that they were metabolites of nitrobenzene transformation via hydroxylaminobenzene."
2199,Production of 2-aminophenoxazine-3-one indicated that oxidation of 2-aminophenol via imine occurred.
2200,Rapid release of ammonia from 2-aminophenol transformation indicated that hydrolysis of the imine intermediate was the dominant reaction.
2201,The low level of 2-aminophenoxazine-3-one indicated that formation of this compound was probably due to a spontaneous reaction accompanying oxidation of 2-aminophenol via imine.
2202,4-Hydroquinone and catechol were reduction products of 2- and 4-benzoquinones.
2203,"Based on these transformation products, we propose a new ammonia release pathway via oxidation of aminophenol to benzoquinone monoimine and subsequent hydrolysis for transformation of nitroaromatic compounds by 3-nitrophenol-grown cells of P. putida 2NP8."
2204,"We propose a parallel mechanism for 3-nitrophenol degradation in P. putida 2NP8, in which all of the possible intermediates are postulated.Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) is a flame retardant that is used as an additive during manufacturing of plastic polymers and electronic circuit boards."
2205,Little is known about the fate of this compound in the environment.
2206,"In the current study we investigated biodegradation of TBBPA, as well as 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP), in slurry of anaerobic sediment from a wet ephemeral desert stream bed contaminated with chemical industry waste."
2207,Anaerobic incubation of the sediment with TBBPA and peptone-tryptone-glucose-yeast extract medium resulted in a 80% decrease in the TBBPA concentration and accumulation of a single metabolite.
2208,This metabolite was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as nonbrominated bisphenol A (BPA).
2209,"On the other hand, TBP was reductively dehalogenated to phenol, which was further metabolized under anaerobic conditions."
2210,BPA persisted in the anaerobic slurry but was degraded aerobically.
2211,"A gram-negative bacterium (strain WH1) was isolated from the contaminated soil, and under aerobic conditions this organism could use BPA as a sole carbon and energy source."
2212,"During degradation of BPA two metabolites were detected in the culture medium, and these metabolites were identified by GC-MS and high-performance liquid chromatography as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 4-hydroxyacetophenone."
2213,Both of those compounds were utilized by WH1 as carbon and energy sources.
2214,"Our findings demonstrate that it may be possible to use a sequential anaerobic-aerobic process to completely degrade TBBPA in contaminated soils.A bacterial strain (strain IFP 2173) was selected from a gasoline-polluted aquifer on the basis of its capacity to use 2,2, 4-trimethylpentane (isooctane) as a sole carbon and energy source."
2215,"This isolate, the first isolate with this capacity to be characterized, was identified by 16S ribosomal DNA analysis, and 100% sequence identity with a reference strain of Mycobacterium austroafricanum was found."
2216,Mycobacterium sp.
2217,"strain IFP 2173 used an unusually wide spectrum of hydrocarbons as growth substrates, including n-alkanes and multimethyl-substituted isoalkanes with chains ranging from 5 to 16 carbon atoms long, as well as substituted monoaromatic hydrocarbons."
2218,"It also attacked ethers, such as methyl t-butyl ether."
2219,"During growth on gasoline, it degraded 86% of the substrate."
2220,"Our results indicated that strain IFP 2173 was capable of degrading 3-methyl groups, possibly by a carboxylation and deacetylation mechanism."
2221,"Evidence that it attacked the quaternary carbon atom structure by an as-yet-undefined mechanism during growth on 2,2,4-trimethylpentane and 2,2-dimethylpentane was also obtained.The biodegradation of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) in liquid cultures with municipal anaerobic sludge showed that at least two degradation routes were involved in the disappearance of the cyclic nitramine."
2222,"In one route, RDX was reduced to give the familiar nitroso derivatives hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3, 5-triazine (MNX) and hexahydro-1,3-dinitroso-5-nitro-1,3,5-triazine (DNX)."
2223,"In the second route, two novel metabolites, methylenedinitramine  and bis(hydroxymethyl)nitramine , formed and were presumed to be ring cleavage products produced by enzymatic hydrolysis of the inner C---N bonds of RDX."
2224,"None of the above metabolites accumulated in the system, and they disappeared to produce nitrous oxide (N(2)O) as a nitrogen-containing end product and formaldehyde (HCHO), methanol (MeOH), and formic acid (HCOOH) that in turn disappeared to produce CH(4) and CO(2) as carbon-containing end products.Using morpholine as sole source of carbon, nitrogen and energy, strain HE5 (DSM 44238) was isolated from forest soil."
2225,The isolated strain was identified as a member of the subgroup of fast-growing Mycobacterium species as revealed by 16S rDNA analysis.
2226,"An identity of 99.4% was obtained to Mycobacterium gilvum; however, the type strain was unable to utilize morpholine."
2227,"A maximal growth rate of 0.17 h(-1) was observed at a morpholine concentration of 30 mM, 30 degrees C and pH 7.2."
2228,The substrate was tolerated at concentrations up to 100 mM.
2229,"Besides morpholine, the strain utilized pyrrolidine, piperidine and proposed intermediates in morpholine metabolism such as glycolate, glyoxylate and ethanolamine."
2230,"Degradation of morpholine, piperidine and pyrrolidine by resting or permeabilized cells was strictly dependent on the presence of oxygen."
2231,Addition of the cytochrome-P450-specific inhibitor metyrapone to the growth medium resulted in a significantly decreased growth rate if these cyclic amines were used as a substrate.
2232,Carbon monoxide difference spectra of crude extracts from cells grown on these substrates compared to spectra obtained for extracts of succinate-grown cells indicated that cytochrome P450 is specifically expressed during growth on the cyclic amines.
2233,These data indicated that a cytochrome-P450-dependent monooxygenase is involved in the degradation of the three cyclic amines.Thioacetamide (TA)-induced hepatotoxicity is potentiated in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.
2234,The relative roles of CYP2E1 and FMO1 in the mechanism of TA-associated liver injury were investigated.
2235,"In the STZ-induced diabetic rat, hepatic CYP2E1 protein concentration and p-nitrophenol hydroxylation were induced 8- and 5.6-fold, respectively."
2236,"Pretreatment with the CYP2E1 inducer, isoniazid (INH, 250 mg/kg, i.p.)"
2237,"before TA (300 mg/kg, i.p.)"
2238,administration significantly increased TA-associated liver injury as assessed by plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT).
2239,Hepatic CYP2E1 expression and p-nitrophenol hydroxylation were induced 2.2- and 2.
2240,"5-fold in the INH-pretreated rat, respectively."
2241,"Inhibition of CYP2E1 by diallyl sulfide (DAS, 200 mg/kg, p.o., two doses) before TA administration, decreased plasma ALT activity by 60% in the nondiabetic rat and by 75% in the diabetic rat."
2242,Abolition of microsomal p-nitrophenol hydroxylation and CCl(4)-induced liver injury confirmed that hepatic CYP2E1 was highly inhibited by DAS.
2243,"Hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) form 1 expression and methimazole-dependent oxidation of thiocholine were induced 2.5- and 1.8-fold in the diabetic rat, respectively."
2244,Dietary administration of 0.25% indole-3-carbinol (I3C) for 10 days inhibited FMO1 expression and enzyme activity in both nondiabetic and diabetic rats.
2245,"Paradoxically, TA-induced liver injury was increased in these I3C-pretreated rats."
2246,These findings indicate that hepatic CYP2E1 appears to be primarily involved in bioactivation of TA.
2247,"In the STZ-induced diabetic rat, diabetes-induced CYP2E1 appears to be responsible for the potentiated liver injury; Even though hepatic FMO1 is induced in the diabetic rat, it is unlikely to mediate the potentiated TA hepatotoxicity.Transfer of the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) degradation plasmids pEMT1 and pJP4 from an introduced donor strain, Pseudomonas putida UWC3, to the indigenous bacteria of two different horizons (A horizon, depth of 0 to 30 cm; B horizon, depth of 30 to 60 cm) of a 2,4-D-contaminated soil was investigated as a means of bioaugmentation."
2248,"When the soil was amended with nutrients, plasmid transfer and enhanced degradation of 2,4-D were observed."
2249,"These findings were most striking in the B horizon, where the indigenous bacteria were unable to degrade any of the 2,4-D (100 mg/kg of soil) during at least 22 days but where inoculation with either of the two plasmid donors resulted in complete 2,4-D degradation within 14 days."
2250,"In contrast, in soils not amended with nutrients, inoculation of donors in the A horizon and subsequent formation of transconjugants (10(5) CFU/g of soil) could not increase the 2,4-D degradation rate compared to that of the noninoculated soil."
2251,"However, donor inoculation in the nonamended B-horizon soil resulted in complete degradation of 2,4-D within 19 days, while no degradation at all was observed in noninoculated soil during 89 days."
2252,"With plasmid pEMT1, this enhanced degradation seemed to be due only to transconjugants (10(5) CFU/g of soil), since the donor was already undetectable when degradation started."
2253,Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes showed that inoculation of the donors was followed by a shift in the microbial community structure of the nonamended B-horizon soils.
2254,"The new 16S rRNA gene fragments in the DGGE profile corresponded with the 16S rRNA genes of 2,4-D-degrading transconjugant colonies isolated on agar plates."
2255,This result indicates that the observed change in the community was due to proliferation of transconjugants formed in soil.
2256,"Overall, this work clearly demonstrates that bioaugmentation can constitute an effective strategy for cleanup of soils which are poor in nutrients and microbial activity, such as those of the B horizon.Denitrifying bacteria capable of degrading halobenzoates were isolated from various geographical and ecological sites."
2257,"The strains were isolated after initial enrichment on one of the monofluoro-, monochloro-, or monobromo-benzoate isomers with nitrate as an electron acceptor, yielding a total of 33 strains isolated from the different halobenzoate-utilizing enrichment cultures."
2258,Each isolate could grow on the selected halobenzoate with nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor.
2259,"The isolates obtained on 2-fluorobenzoate could use 2-fluorobenzoate under both aerobic and denitrifying conditions, but did not degrade other halobenzoates."
2260,"In contrast, the 4-fluorobenzoate isolates degraded 4-fluorobenzoate under denitrifying conditions only, but utilized 2-fluorobenzoate under both aerobic and denitrifying conditions."
2261,"The strains isolated on either 3-chlorobenzoate or 3-bromobenzoate could use 3-chlorobenzoate, 3-bromobenzoate, and 2- and 4-fluorobenzoates under denitrifying conditions."
2262,The isolates were identified and classified on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and their cellular fatty acid profiles.
2263,"They were placed in nine genera belonging to either the alpha-, beta-, or gamma-branch of the Proteobacteria, namely, Acidovorax, Azoarcus, Bradyrhizobium, Ochrobactrum, Paracoccus, Pseudomonas, Mesorhizobium, Ensifer, and Thauera."
2264,"These results indicate that the ability to utilize different halobenzoates under denitrifying conditions is ubiquitously distributed in the Proteobacteria and that these bacteria are widely distributed in soils and sediments.Triphenyltin (TPT)-degrading bacteria were screened by a simple technique using a post-column high-performance liquid chromatography using 3,3\',4\',7-tetrahydroxyflavone as a post-column reagent for determination of TPT and its metabolite, diphenyltin (DPT)."
2265,"An isolated strain, strain CNR15, was identified as Pseudomonas chlororaphis on the basis of its morphological and biochemical features."
2266,"The incubation of strain CNR15 in a medium containing glycerol, succinate, and 130 microM TPT resulted in the rapid degradation of TPT and the accumulation of approximately 40 microM DPT as the only metabolite after 48 h. The culture supernatants of strain CNR15, grown with or without TPT, exhibited a TPT degradation activity, whereas the resting cells were not capable of degrading TPT."
2267,"TPT was stoichiometrically degraded to DPT by the solid-phase extract of the culture supernatant, and benzene was detected as another degradation product."
2268,"We found that the TPT degradation was catalyzed by low-molecular-mass substances (approximately 1,000 Da) in the extract, termed the TPT-degrading factor."
2269,"The other fluorescent pseudomonads, P. chlororaphis ATCC 9446, Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15692, also showed TPT degradation activity similar to strain CNR15 in the solid-phase extracts of their culture supernatants."
2270,These results suggest that the extracellular low-molecular-mass substance that is universally produced by the fluorescent pseudomonad could function as a potent catalyst to cometabolite TPT in the environment.Ethionamide (ETA) is an important component of second-line therapy for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.
2271,Synthesis of radiolabeled ETA and an examination of drug metabolites formed by whole cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) have allowed us to demonstrate that ETA is activated by S-oxidation before interacting with its cellular target.
2272,ETA is metabolized by MTb to a 4-pyridylmethanol product remarkably similar in structure to that formed by the activation of isoniazid by the catalase-peroxidase KatG.
2273,"We have demonstrated that overproduction of Rv3855 (EtaR), a putative regulatory protein from MTb, confers ETA resistance whereas overproduction of an adjacent, clustered monooxygenase (Rv3854c, EtaA) confers ETA hypersensitivity."
2274,"Production of EtaA appears to be negatively regulated by EtaR and correlates directly with ETA metabolism, suggesting that EtaA is the activating enzyme responsible for thioamide oxidation and subsequent toxicity."
2275,"Coding sequence mutations in EtaA were found in 11 of 11 multidrug-resistant MTb patient isolates from Cape Town, South Africa."
2276,"These isolates showed broad cross-resistance to thiocarbonyl containing drugs including ETA, thiacetazone, and thiocarlide.Advances in industrial biotechnology offer potential opportunities for economic utilization of agro-industrial residues such as coffee pulp and coffee husk."
2277,"Coffee pulp or husk is a fibrous mucilagenous material (sub-product) obtained during the processing of coffee cherries by wet or dry process, respectively."
2278,"Coffee pulp/husk contains some amount of caffeine and tannins, which makes it toxic in nature, resulting the disposal problem."
2279,"However, it is rich in organic nature, which makes it an ideal substrate for microbial processes for the production of value-added products."
2280,Several solutions and alternative uses of the coffee pulp and husk have been attempted.
2281,"These include as fertilizers, livestock feed, compost, etc."
2282,"However, these applications utilize only a fraction of available quantity and are not technically very efficient."
2283,"Attempts have been made to detoxify it for improved application as feed, and to produce several products such as enzymes, organic acids, flavour and aroma compounds, and mushrooms, etc."
2284,from coffee pulp/husk.
2285,Solid state fermentation has been mostly employed for bioconversion processes.
2286,Factorial design experiments offer useful information for the process optimization.
2287,This paper reviews the developments on processes and products developed for the value-addition of coffee pulp/husk through the biotechnological means.The dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducing bacterium Geobacter sulfurreducens reduced and precipitated Tc(VII) by two mechanisms.
2288,"Washed cell suspensions coupled the oxidation of hydrogen to enzymatic reduction of Tc(VII) to Tc(IV), leading to the precipitation of TcO(2) at the periphery of the cell."
2289,"An indirect, Fe(II)-mediated mechanism was also identified."
2290,"Acetate, although not utilized efficiently as an electron donor for direct cell-mediated reduction of technetium, supported the reduction of Fe(III), and the Fe(II) formed was able to transfer electrons abiotically to Tc(VII)."
2291,Tc(VII) reduction was comparatively inefficient via this indirect mechanism when soluble Fe(III) citrate was supplied to the cultures but was enhanced in the presence of solid Fe(III) oxide.
2292,"The rate of Tc(VII) reduction was optimal, however, when Fe(III) oxide reduction was stimulated by the addition of the humic analog and electron shuttle anthaquinone-2,6-disulfonate, leading to the rapid formation of the Fe(II)-bearing mineral magnetite."
2293,"Under these conditions, Tc(VII) was reduced and precipitated abiotically on the nanocrystals of biogenic magnetite as TcO(2) and was removed from solution to concentrations below the limit of detection by scintillation counting."
2294,Cultures of Fe(III)-reducing bacteria enriched from radionuclide-contaminated sediment using Fe(III) oxide as an electron acceptor in the presence of 25 microM Tc(VII) contained a single Geobacter sp.
2295,detected by 16S ribosomal DNA analysis and were also able to reduce and precipitate the radionuclide via biogenic magnetite.
2296,"Fe(III) reduction was stimulated in aquifer material, resulting in the formation of Fe(II)-containing minerals that were able to reduce and precipitate Tc(VII)."
2297,"These results suggest that Fe(III)-reducing bacteria may play an important role in immobilizing technetium in sediments via direct and indirect mechanisms.A bacterial strain KU-7, identified as a Pseudomonas fluorescens by 16S rDNA sequencing, was one of the 12 new isolates that are able to grow on 2-nitrobenzoate as a sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy."
2298,Resting cells of KU-7 were found to accumulate ammonia in the medium indicating that degradation of 2-NBA proceeds through a reductive route.
2299,Metabolite analyses by thin layer chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography indicated that 3-hydroxyanthranilate is an intermediate of 2-nitrobenzoate metabolism in KU-7 cells.
2300,This offers an alternative route to 2-nitrobenzoate metabolism since anthranilate (2-aminobenzoate) or catechol were detected as intermediates in other bacteria.
2301,Crude extracts of KU-7 cells converted 2-nitrobenzoate to 3-hydroxyanthranilate with oxidation of 2 mol of NADPH.
2302,"Ring cleavage of 3-hydroxyanthranilate produced a transient yellow product, identified as 2-amino-3-carboxymuconic 6-semialdehyde, that has a maximum absorbance at 360 nm."
2303,The initial enzymes of the 2-nitrobenzoate degradation pathway were found to be inducible since succinate-grown cells produced very low enzyme activities.
2304,A pathway for 2-nitrobenzoate degradation in KU-7 was proposed.An arylketone monooxygenase was purified from Pseudomonas putida JD1 by ion exchange and affinity chromatography.
2305,"It had the characteristics of a Baeyer-Villiger-type monooxygenase and converted its substrate, 4-hydroxyacetophenone, into 4-hydroxyphenyl acetate with the consumption of one molecule of oxygen and oxidation of one molecule of NADPH per molecule of substrate."
2306,"The enzyme was a monomer with an M(r) of about 70,000 and contained one molecule of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)."
2307,"The enzyme was specific for NADPH as the electron donor, and spectral studies showed rapid reduction of the FAD by NADPH but not by NADH."
2308,"Other arylketones were substrates, including acetophenone and 4-hydroxypropiophenone, which were converted into phenyl acetate and 4-hydroxyphenyl propionate, respectively."
2309,"The enzyme displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with apparent K(m) values of 47 microM for 4-hydroxyacetophenone, 384 microM for acetophenone, and 23 microM for 4-hydroxypropiophenone."
2310,The apparent K(m) value for NADPH with 4-hydroxyacetophenone as substrate was 17.5 microM.
2311,"The N-terminal sequence did not show any similarity to other proteins, but an internal sequence was very similar to part of the proposed NADPH binding site in the Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenase cyclohexanone monooxygenase from an Acinetobacter sp.Anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene was investigated with a sulfate-reducing enrichment culture."
2312,Metabolite analyses revealed two groups of degradation products.
2313,The first group comprised two succinic acid adducts which were identified as naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid and naphthyl-2-methylene-succinic acid by comparison with chemically synthesized reference compounds.
2314,Naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid accumulated to 0.5 microM in culture supernatants.
2315,Production of naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid was analyzed in enzyme assays with dense cell suspensions.
2316,The conversion of 2-methylnaphthalene to naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid was detected at a specific activity of 0.020 +/- 0.003 nmol min(-1) mg of protein(-1) only in the presence of cells and fumarate.
2317,"We conclude that under anaerobic conditions 2-methylnaphthalene is activated by fumarate addition to the methyl group, as is the case in anaerobic toluene degradation."
2318,"The second group of metabolites comprised 2-naphthoic acid and reduced 2-naphthoic acid derivatives, including 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid, octahydro-2-naphthoic acid, and decahydro-2-naphthoic acid."
2319,These compounds were also identified in an earlier study as products of anaerobic naphthalene degradation with the same enrichment culture.
2320,"A pathway for anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene analogous to that for anaerobic toluene degradation is proposed.A chromosomal region encoding a two-component regulatory system, FlhRS, has been isolated from Paracoccus denitrificans."
2321,"FlhRS-deficient mutants were unable to grow on methanol, methylamine, or choline as the carbon and energy source."
2322,"Expression of the gene encoding glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (fhlA) was undetectable in the mutant, and expression of the S-formylglutathione hydrolase gene (fghA) was reduced in the mutant background."
2323,"In addition, methanol dehydrogenase was immunologically undetectable in cell extracts of FhlRS mutants."
2324,"These results indicate that the FlhRS sensor-regulator pair is involved in the regulation of formaldehyde, methanol, and methylamine oxidation."
2325,The effect that the FlhRS proteins exert on the regulation of C(1) metabolism might be essential to maintain the internal concentration of formaldehyde below toxic levels.The biodegradation of benzothiazole and 2-hydroxybenzothiazole by two strains of Rhodococcus was monitored by reversed phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and by (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
2326,Both xenobiotics were biotransformed into a hydroxylated derivative of 2-hydroxybenzothiazole by these two strains.
2327,The chemical structure of this metabolite was determined by a new NMR methodology: long-range (1)H-(15)N heteronuclear shift correlation without any previous (15)N enrichment of the compound.
2328,"This powerful NMR tool allowed us to assign the metabolite structure to 2,6-dihydroxybenzothiazole.Cultures of Mycobacterium sp."
2329,"strain PYR-1 were dosed with anthracene or phenanthrene and after 14 days of incubation had degraded 92 and 90% of the added anthracene and phenanthrene, respectively."
2330,"The metabolites were extracted and identified by UV-visible light absorption, high-pressure liquid chromatography retention times, mass spectrometry, (1)H and (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, and comparison to authentic compounds and literature data."
2331,"Neutral-pH ethyl acetate extracts from anthracene-incubated cells showed four metabolites, identified as cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydroanthracene, 6,7-benzocoumarin, 1-methoxy-2-hydroxyanthracene, and 9,10-anthraquinone."
2332,A novel anthracene ring fission product was isolated from acidified culture media and was identified as 3-(2-carboxyvinyl)naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid.
2333,"6,7-Benzocoumarin was also found in that extract."
2334,When Mycobacterium sp.
2335,"strain PYR-1 was grown in the presence of phenanthrene, three neutral metabolites were identified as cis- and trans-9,10-dihydroxy-9,10-dihydrophenanthrene and cis-3,4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrophenanthrene."
2336,"Phenanthrene ring fission products, isolated from acid extracts, were identified as 2,2\'-diphenic acid, 1-hydroxynaphthoic acid, and phthalic acid."
2337,"The data point to the existence, next to already known routes for both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, of alternative pathways that might be due to the presence of different dioxygenases or to a relaxed specificity of the same dioxygenase for initial attack on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.Isonitrile containing an N triple bond C triple bond was degraded by microorganism sp."
2338,"N19-2, which was isolated from soil through a 2-month acclimatization culture in the presence of this compound."
2339,The isonitrile-degrading microorganism was identified as Pseudomonas putida.
2340,"The microbial degradation was found to proceed through an enzymatic reaction, the isonitrile being hydrated to the corresponding N-substituted formamide."
2341,"The enzyme, named isonitrile hydratase, was purified and characterized."
2342,The native enzyme had a molecular mass of about 59 kDa and consisted of two identical subunits.
2343,"The enzyme stoichiometrically catalyzed the hydration of cyclohexyl isocyanide (an isonitrile) to N-cyclohexylformamide, but no formation of other compounds was detected."
2344,The apparent K(m) value for cyclohexyl isocyanide was 16.2 mm.
2345,"Although the enzyme acted on various isonitriles, no nitriles or amides were accepted as substrates.Arthrobacter globiformis D47 was shown to degrade a range of substituted phenylurea herbicides in soil."
2346,This strain contained two plasmids of approximately 47 kb (pHRIM620) and 34 kb (pHRIM621).
2347,Plasmid-curing experiments produced plasmid-free strains as well as strains containing either the 47- or the 34-kb plasmid.
2348,"The strains were tested for their ability to degrade diuron, which demonstrated that the degradative genes were located on the 47-kb plasmid."
2349,Studies on the growth of these strains indicated that the ability to degrade diuron did not offer a selective advantage to A. globiformis D47 on minimal medium designed to contain the herbicide as a sole carbon source.
2350,"The location of the genes on a plasmid and a lack of selection would explain why the degradative phenotype, as with many other pesticide-degrading bacteria, can be lost on subculture."
2351,A 22-kb EcoRI fragment of plasmid pHRIM620 was expressed in Escherichia coli and enabled cells to degrade diuron.
2352,Transposon mutagenesis of this fragment identified one open reading frame that was essential for enzyme activity.
2353,A smaller subclone of this gene (2.5 kb) expressed in E. coli coded for the protein that degraded diuron.
2354,This gene and its predicted protein sequence showed only a low level of protein identity (25% over ca.
2355,"440 amino acids) to other database sequences and was named after the enzyme it encoded, phenylurea hydrolase (puhA gene).Recent studies on the diversity and ubiquity of Fe(III)-reducing organisms in different environments led to the isolation and identification of four new dissimilatory Fe(III)-reducers (strains H-2T, 172T, TACP-2T and TACP-5)."
2356,"All four isolates are non-motile, Gram-negative, freshwater, mesophilic, strict anaerobes with morphology identical to that of Geobacter metallireducens strain GS-15T."
2357,"Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences indicated that the new isolates belong to the genus Geobacter, in the delta-Proteobacteria."
2358,"Significant differences in phenotypic characteristics, DNA-DNA homology and G+C content indicated that the four isolates represent three new species of the genus."
2359,The names Geobacter hydrogenophilus sp.
2360,"nov. (strain H-2T), Geobacter chapellei sp."
2361,nov. (strain 172T) and Geobacter grbiciae sp.
2362,nov. (strains TACP-2T and TACP-5) are proposed.
2363,"Geobacter hydrogenophilus and Geobacter chapellei were isolated from a petroleum-contaminated aquifer and a pristine, deep, subsurface aquifer, respectively."
2364,Geobacter grbiciae was isolated from aquatic sediments.
2365,All of the isolates can obtain energy for growth by coupling the oxidation of acetate to the reduction of Fe(III).
2366,"The four isolates also coupled Fe(III) reduction to the oxidation of other simple, volatile fatty acids."
2367,"In addition, Geobacter hydrogenophilus and Geobacter grbiciae were able to oxidize aromatic compounds such as benzoate, whilst Geobacter grbiciae was also able to use the monoaromatic hydrocarbon toluene.Simultaneous Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation was observed in a fixed-film bioreactor consisting of a coculture of phenol-degrading bacteria, Pseudomonas putida DMP-1, and Cr(VI)-reducing bacteria, Escherichia coli ATCC 33456."
2368,Near complete Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation was observed during steady-state operation of the reactor under loadings of 5-21 mg Cr(VI) l-1 d-1 and 840-3350 mg phenol l-1 d-1.
2369,"2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (2HMSA), succinate, and acetate were the detected steady-state organic acid metabolites which accounted for 13-23% of TOC in the effluent."
2370,Optimum Cr(VI) reduction rate was observed under a Cr(VI) loading of approximately 26.5 mg Cr(VI) l-1 d-1 just before system overload.
2371,System overload was characterized by the increase in effluent Cr(VI) and phenol concentrations.
2372,System resilience to Cr(VI) toxicity was demonstrated by rapid recovery of biological activity and reduced effluent Cr(VI) and phenol concentrations after off-loading the system from overloaded conditions.Chromium is a highly toxic non-essential metal for microorganisms and plants.
2373,"Due to its widespread industrial use, chromium (Cr) has become a serious pollutant in diverse environmental settings."
2374,"The hexavalent form of the metal, Cr(VI), is considered a more toxic species than the relatively innocuous and less mobile Cr(III) form."
2375,The presence of Cr in the environment has selected microbial and plant variants able to tolerate high levels of Cr compounds.
2376,"The diverse Cr-resistance mechanisms displayed by microorganisms, and probably by plants, include biosorption, diminished accumulation, precipitation, reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), and chromate efflux."
2377,Some of these systems have been proposed as potential biotechnological tools for the bioremediation of Cr pollution.
2378,"In this review we summarize the interactions of bacteria, algae, fungi and plants with Cr and its compounds.Several 2-substituted benzoates (including 2-trifluoromethyl-, 2-chloro-, 2-bromo-, 2-iodo-, 2-nitro-, 2-methoxy-, and 2-acetyl-benzoates) were converted by phthalate-grown Arthrobacter keyseri (formerly Micrococcus sp.)"
2379,"12B to the corresponding 2-substituted 3,4-dihydroxybenzoates (protocatechuates)."
2380,"Because these products lack a carboxyl group at the 2 position, they were not substrates for the next enzyme of the phthalate catabolic pathway, 3,4-dihydroxyphthalate 2-decarboxylase, and accumulated."
2381,"When these incubations were carried out in iron-containing minimal medium, the products formed colored chelates."
2382,"This chromogenic response was subsequently used to identify recombinant Escherichia coli strains carrying genes encoding the responsible enzymes, phthalate 3,4-dioxygenase and 3,4-dihydroxy-3,4-dihydrophthalate dehydrogenase, from the 130-kbp plasmid pRE1 of strain 12B."
2383,"Beginning with the initially cloned 8.14-kbp PstI fragment of pRE824 as a probe to identify recombinant plasmids carrying overlapping fragments, a DNA segment of 33.5 kbp was cloned from pRE1 on several plasmids and mapped using restriction endonucleases."
2384,"From these plasmids, the sequence of 26,274 contiguous bp was determined."
2385,"Sequenced DNA included several genetic units: tnpR, pcm operon, ptr genes, pehA, norA fragment, and pht operon, encoding a transposon resolvase, catabolism of protocatechuate (3,4-dihydroxybenzoate), a putative ATP-binding cassette transporter, a possible phthalate ester hydrolase, a fragment of a norfloxacin resistance-like transporter, and the conversion of phthalate to protocatechuate, respectively."
2386,"Activities of the eight enzymes involved in the catabolism of phthalate through protocatechuate to pyruvate and oxaloacetate were demonstrated in cells or cell extracts of recombinant E. coli strains.Ten years ago, an anaerobic ammonium oxidation (\'anammox\') process was discovered in a denitrifying pilot plant reactor."
2387,"From this system, a highly enriched microbial community was obtained, dominated by a single deep-branching planctomycete, Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans."
2388,Phylogenetic inventories of different wastewater treatment plants with anammox activity have suggested that at least two genera in Planctomycetales can catalyse the anammox process.
2389,Electron microscopy of the ultrastructure of B. anammoxidans has shown that several membrane-bounded compartments are present inside the cytoplasm.
2390,"Hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, a key anammox enzyme, is found exclusively inside one of these compartments, tentatively named the \'anammoxosome\'.Beijerinckia sp strain B1 grows with biphenyl as its sole source of carbon and energy."
2391,"A mutant, strain B8/36, oxidized biphenyl to cis-(2S,3R)-dihydroxy-l-phenylcyclohexa-4,6-diene (cis-biphenyl dihydrodiol)."
2392,"Strain B8/36 oxidized anthracene, phenanthrene, benzanthracene and benzopyrene to cis-dihydrodiols."
2393,"Other substrates oxidized to cis-dihydrodiols were dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene and dibenzo-p-dioxin."
2394,"Biphenyl dioxygenase activity was observed in cells of Beijerinckia B1 and B8/36 after growth in the presence of biphenyl, m-, p-xylene and salicylate."
2395,Recent studies have led to the reclassification of Beijerinckia B1 as Sphingomonas yanoikuyae strain B1.
2396,"Subsequent biotransformation studies showed that S. yanoikuyae B8/36 oxidized chrysene to a bis-cis-diol with hydroxyl substituents at the 3,4- and 9,10-positions."
2397,"Dihydronaphthalene was oxidized to cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene, naphthalene, cis-1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene and 2-hydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene."
2398,Anisole and phenetole were oxidized to phenol.
2399,"Thus the S. yanoikuyae biphenyl dioxygenase catalyzes cis-dihydroxylation, benzylic monohydroxylation, desaturation and dealkylation reactions."
2400,"To date, the genes encoding biphenyl dioxygenase have not been cloned."
2401,"However, the nucleotide sequence of a S. yanoikuyaeB1 DNA fragment contains five different alpha subunits as determined by conserved amino acids coordinating iron in a Rieske  center and mononuclear iron at the catalytic site."
2402,The specific role of the different putative oxygenases in biotransformation reactions catalyzed by S. yanoikuyae is not known and presents an exciting challenge for future studies.Pesticides are chemical substances used in agricultural production to protect crops against pests.
2403,"They help to achieve better quality and quantity of crops; however, they also are capable of causing occupational diseases in farmers."
2404,Skin is the most exposed organ while spraying the pesticide on fields.
2405,"Farmers are also exposed to pesticides while mixing, loading the pesticide as well as while cleaning the equipment and disposing of empty containers."
2406,"Other activities associated with exposure are sowing pesticide-preserved seeds, weeding and harvesting previously sprayed crops."
2407,During the first decades of using pesticides the main problem was the risk of acute intoxication among people occupationally exposed.
2408,"With decrease in the toxicity of improved pesticides, attention was turned to chronic intoxication and environmental contamination."
2409,"Nowadays, the problem of diseases not immediately related to the toxic potential of pesticides gains increasing interest."
2410,The majority of these non-toxic diseases are dermatoses.
2411,"Most pesticide-related dermatoses are contact dermatitis, both allergic or irritant."
2412,"Rare clinical forms also occur, including urticaria, erythema multiforme, ashy dermatosis, parakeratosis variegata, porphyria cutanea tarda, chloracne, skin hypopigmentation, nail and hair disorders."
2413,"Farmers exposed to arsenic pesticides are at risk of occupational skin cancer, mostly morbus Bowen (carcinoma in situ), multiple basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas."
2414,"Non-arsenic pesticides, e.g."
2415,"paraquat, are also potentially carcinogenic.We report a very unusual adverse effect--fosfomycin-induced repeat liver toxicity--in a female adult with cystic fibrosis (CF).Naphthalene was used as a model compound in order to study the anaerobic pathway of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation."
2416,"Previously we had determined that carboxylation is an initial step for anaerobic metabolism of naphthalene, but no other intermediate metabolites were identified (Zhang & Young 1997)."
2417,In the present study we further elucidate the pathway with the identification of six novel naphthalene metabolites detected when cultures were fed naphthalene in the presence of its analog 1 -fluoronaphthalene.
2418,Results from cultures supplemented with either deuterated naphthalene or non-deuterated naphthalene plus bicarbonate confirm that the metabolites originated from naphthalene.
2419,"Three of these metabolites were identified by comparison with the following standards: 2-naphthoic acid (2-NA), 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid, and decahydro-2-naphthoic acid."
2420,"The presence of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-NA as a metabolite of naphthalene degradation indicates that the first reduction reaction occurs at the unsubstituted ring, rather than the carboxylated ring."
2421,"The overall results suggest that after the initial carboxylation of naphthalene, 2-NA is sequentially reduced to decahydro-2-naphthoic acid through 5 hydrogenation reactions, each of which eliminated one double bond."
2422,"Incorporation of deuterium atoms from D2O into 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid suggests that water is the proton source for hydrogenation.Degradation of pesticides in aquifers has been evaluated based on a number of co-ordinated field and laboratory studies carried out in Danish aquifers."
2423,"These studies included investigations of vertical and horizontal variability in degradation rates from the vadose zone to an aquifer, the effects of aerobic versus anaerobic conditions, and the importance of concentration on degradation kinetics for a selected range of herbicides."
2424,"The studies were based on different experimental approaches ranging from simple batch experiments to column studies to field injection experiments and, where appropriate, results were compared."
2425,"Some herbicides were degraded under aerobic conditions (some phenoxy acids, DNOC and glyphosate) and others under aerobic conditions (other phenoxy acids, DNOC; there was some indication of atrazine transformation)."
2426,"Certain pesticides were not degraded in any investigations (dichlobenil, the dichlobenil metabolite 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM), bentazone, isoproturon, metamitron and metsulfuron-methyl)."
2427,"The spatial variability was substantial, since hardly any of the investigated pesticides were degraded in all comparable samples."
2428,This means that it is very difficult to claim that a given pesticide is readily degradable in aquifers.
2429,"However, the experimental approaches used (with incubations lasting more than a year) may not be sensitive enough to verify the low degradation rates that may be significant as a result of the long retention time of groundwaters.Adding sludge to agricultural soil results in added organic matter, nutrients and metallic and/or organic pollutants."
2430,These components may modify the behaviour of pesticides in the soil.
2431,"We monitored possible changes in the degradation of the herbicide isoproturon (production of CO2 and degradation products) in soil amended with sludge, heavy metals or nitrogen and phosphorus."
2432,The treated and control soils were incubated under controlled conditions for 60 days.
2433,"The nitrogen and phosphorus had the greatest effect on isoproturon degradation, independent of the presence of pollutants."
2434,"Mineralisation of the herbicide to CO2 was slow and seemed to be linked to a fast degradation and to the accumulation of a complex degradation product that was neither catabolized nor adsorbed, 4,4\'-diisopropylazobenzene."
2435,This degradation pathway also produced smaller amounts of non-extractable residues.
2436,"Sewage sludge had no significant effect on isoproturon degradation, despite a large increase of organic matter mineralisation (factor 2).A cytochrome P450 and an iron-sulfur protein, whose expression was specifically induced during growth of Mycobacterium sp."
2437,"strain HE5 on morpholine as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy were purified to apparent homogeneity."
2438,"Due to the lack of enzymatic activity, carbon monoxide difference spectra and determination of the acid-labile sulfur, respectively, were used to detect the proteins during purification."
2439,"The cytochrome P450, designated P450mor, was characterized as a monomer with an apparent molecular mass of 44.7 kDa."
2440,The amino acid sequence of an internal peptide comprising 19 amino acids was identical to the sequence derived from a gene encoding a cytochrome P450 from Mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2)155 suggested to be involved in the utilization of piperidine and pyrrolidine.
2441,The iron-sulfur protein was characterized as a ferredoxin exhibiting a molecular mass of 6.8 kDa and named Fdmor.
2442,An identity of 48-77% was obtained for the 30 N-terminal amino acids of Fdmor and the corresponding sequences of different 3Fe-4S-ferredoxins known to be involved in P450-dependent reactions.
2443,From these data we concluded that growth of Mycobacterium sp.
2444,strain HE5 on morpholine led to the expression of a cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase system composed of at least two different proteins.Explosive-contaminated land poses a hazard both to the environment and to human health.
2445,"Microbial enzymes, either in their native or heterologous hosts, are a powerful and low-cost tool for eliminating this environmental hazard."
2446,"As many explosives have only been present in the environment for 10 years, and with similar molecules not known in Nature, the origin of enzymes specialized for the breakdown of explosives is of particular interest."
2447,Screening of environmental isolates resulted in the discovery of flavoproteins capable of denitrating the explosives pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and glycerol trinitrate.
2448,These nitrate ester reductases are related in sequence and structure to Old Yellow Enzyme from Saccharomyces carlsbergenisis.
2449,"All the members of this family have alpha/beta barrel structures and FMN as a prosthetic group, and reduce various electrophilic substrates."
2450,"The nitrate ester reductases are, however, unusual in that they display activity towards the highly recalcitrant, aromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, via a reductive pathway resulting in nitrogen liberation."
2451,We have embarked on a detailed study of the structure and mechanism of PETN reductase from a strain of Enterobacter cloacae.
2452,"Work is focused currently on relating structure and function within this growing family of enzymes, with a view to engineering novel enzymes exhibiting useful characteristics.In this paper the use of arsenic compounds as anticancer agents in clinical trials and in in vitro investigations is reviewed, including the experience at our institute."
2453,Treatment of newly diagnosed and relapsed patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) has been found to result in complete remission (CR) rates of 85-93% when given by intravenous infusion for 2-3 h at a dose of 10 mg/day diluted in 5% glucose saline solution.
2454,Patients exhibit a response in 28-42 days.
2455,"CR rates after administration of Composite Indigo Naturalis tablets containing arsenic sulfide and of pure tetraarsenic tetrasulfide reached 98% and 84.9%, respectively."
2456,"At higher concentrations (1-2 microM), arsenic induced apoptosis, while at lower concentrations (0.1-0.5 microM), it triggered cell differentiation in vitro."
2457,"As2O3-induced apoptosis has been observed in many cancer cell lines, including esophageal carcinoma, gastric cancer, neuroblastoma, lymphoid malignancies, and multiple myeloma."
2458,Its effectiveness was confirmed in the treatment of multiple myeloma.
2459,Arsenic compounds are effective agents in the treatment of APL and their activity against other types of cancer requires further investigation.Pivalic acid is used as a prodrug to increase gut absorption of a variety of different antibiotics.
2460,Pivalic acid is also known to induce a number of metabolic aberrations which may be in part explained by concurrent mild carnitine depletion.
2461,"Rat pups (5 days old) born to mothers treated throughout their pregnancy and lactation period with sodium pivalate, showed an increase in liver and muscle triglycerides and elevated plasma ketone bodies, compared to controls."
2462,"A reduction of free carnitine content in liver, muscle and plasma was also observed in the pivalate treated group."
2463,"In a second study, pups were treated with either pivalate for 24 days (females), or pivalate for 120 days (males)."
2464,Both groups were fed standard diets.
2465,"In both groups (male and female), the pivalate treatment showed a statistically significant hyperinsulinaemia and an increase of body mass compared with that of age- and sex-matched control groups."
2466,"In addition, after a glucose loading, significantly higher levels of insulin in the pivalate-treated group (male) with respect to controls were observed."
2467,"In conclusion, our data suggest that maternal pivalate treatment may predispose adult offspring to developing insulin-resistance and obesity.Turgor-driven plant cell growth depends on wall structure."
2468,Two allelic l-fucose-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana mutants (mur1-1 and 1-2) are dwarfed and their rosette leaves do not grow normally.
2469,"mur1 leaf cell walls contain normal amounts of the cell wall pectic polysaccharide rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II), but only half exists as a borate cross-linked dimer."
2470,The altered structure of mur1 RG-II reduces the rate of formation and stability of this cross-link.
2471,Exogenous aqueous borate rescues the defect.
2472,The reduced cross-linking of RG-II in dwarf mur1 plants indicates that plant growth depends on wall pectic polysaccharide organization.A Rhodococcus sp.
2473,isolated from contaminated river sediment was investigated to determine if the isolate could degrade high molecular mass polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
2474,The Rhodococcus sp.
2475,"was able to utilize anthracene (53%), phenanthrene (31%), pyrene (13%), and fluoranthene (5%) as sole source of carbon and energy, but not naphthalene or chrysene."
2476,"In a study of the degradation of anthracene by a Rhodococcus sp., the identification of ring-fission products indicated at least two ring-cleavage pathways."
2477,"One results in the production of 6,7-benzocoumarin, previously shown to be produced chemically from the product of meta cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxyanthracene, a pathway which has been well established in Gram-negative bacteria."
2478,"The second is an ortho cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxyanthracene that produces 3-(2-carboxyvinyl)naphthalene-2-carboxylic acid, a dicarboxylic acid ring-fission product."
2479,This represents a novel metabolic pathway only identified in Gram-positive bacteria.The cell homogenate and the soluble cell fraction of Wolinella succinogenes grown with formate and fumarate catalyzed the oxidation of benzyl viologen radical by methacrylate  or acrylate .
2480,Crotonate did not serve as an oxidant.
2481,A mutant of W. succinogenes lacking the fccABC operon was unable to catalyze methacrylate or acrylate reduction.
2482,"In contrast, the inactivation of fccC alone had no effect on these activities."
2483,Methacrylate reduction by benzyl viologen radical was not catalyzed by fumarate reductase isolated from the membrane of W. succinogenes.
2484,"Cells grown with formate and fumarate did not catalyze methacrylate reduction by formate, and W. succinogenes did not grow with formate and methacrylate as catabolic substrates."
2485,The results suggest that the reduction of methacrylate or acrylate by benzyl viologen radical is most likely catalyzed either by the periplasmic flavoprotein FccA or by a complex consisting of FccA and the predicted c-type cytochrome FccB.
2486,"The metabolic function of the fccABC operon remains unknown.The safety of daily application of N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) (1.7 g of DEET/day) in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy was assessed as part of a double-blind, randomized, therapeutic trial of insect repellents for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy (n = 897)."
2487,"No adverse neurologic, gastrointestinal, or dermatologic effects were observed for women who applied a median total dose of 214.2 g of DEET per pregnancy (range = 0-345.1 g)."
2488,DEET crossed the placenta and was detected in 8% (95% confidence interval = 2.6-18.2) of cord blood samples from a randomly selected subgroup of DEET users (n = 50).
2489,"No adverse effects on survival, growth, or development at birth, or at one year, were found."
2490,This is the first study to document the safety of DEET applied regularly in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
2491,"The results suggest that the risk of DEET accumulating in the fetus is low and that DEET is safe to use in later pregnancy.A soil bacterium (designated strain SRS2) able to metabolize the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon, 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (IPU), was isolated from a previously IPU-treated agricultural soil."
2492,"Based on a partial analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and the cellular fatty acids, the strain was identified as a Sphingomonas sp."
2493,within the alpha-subdivision of the proteobacteria.
2494,"Strain SRS2 was able to mineralize IPU when provided as a source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy."
2495,Supplementing the medium with a mixture of amino acids considerably enhanced IPU mineralization.
2496,"Mineralization of IPU was accompanied by transient accumulation of the metabolites 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1-methylurea, 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-urea, and 4-isopropyl-aniline identified by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, thus indicating a metabolic pathway initiated by two successive N-demethylations, followed by cleavage of the urea side chain and finally by mineralization of the phenyl structure."
2497,"Strain SRS2 also transformed the dimethylurea-substituted herbicides diuron and chlorotoluron, giving rise to as-yet-unidentified products."
2498,"In addition, no degradation of the methoxy-methylurea-substituted herbicide linuron was observed."
2499,"This report is the first characterization of a pure bacterial culture able to mineralize IPU.Under ligninolytic conditions, the white-rot basidiomycete Coriolus versicolor metabolized chloronitrofen (2, 4, 6-trichloro-4\'-nitrodiphenyl ether; CNP) and nitrofen (2, 4-dichloro-4\'-nitrodiphenyl ether, NIP), which constitute the largest class of commercially produced diphenyl ether herbicides."
2500,The pathway of CNP degradation was elucidated by the identification of fungal metabolites upon addition of CNP and its metabolic intermediates.
2501,"The metabolic pathway was initially branched to form four metabolites--2, 4, 6-trichloro-3-hydroxy-4\'-nitrodiphenyl ether, 2, 4-dichloro-6-hydroxy-4\'-nitrodiphenyl ether, NIP, and 2, 4, 6-trichloro-4\'-aminodiphenyl ether--indicating the involvement of hydroxylation, oxidative dechlorination, reductive dechlorination, and nitro-reduction."
2502,"Of these reactions, hydroxylation was relatively major compared to the others."
2503,"Extracellular ligninolytic enzymes such as lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and laccase did not catalyze the oxidation of either CNP or NIP."
2504,"Piperonyl butoxide, an inhibitor of cytochrome P450, suppressed fungal oxidation of CNP and NIP to their hydroxylated products."
2505,The inhibition resulted in increasing the amount of reductively dechlorinated and nitro-reduced products.
2506,"These observations strongly suggest that basidiomycetes may possess a mechanism for a strict substrate recognition system and a corresponding metabolic response system to effectively degrade environmentally persistent aromatic compounds.In the first half of the twentieth century epidemiologic evidence linked elevated incidences of pulmonary fibrosis and cancer with inhalation of chrysotile and crocidolite asbestos, a family of naturally occurring inorganic fibrous materials."
2507,"As the serpentine and amphibole forms of asbestos were phased out, synthetic vitreous fibers (SVFs; fiber glass, mineral wool, and refractory fiber) became increasingly utilized, and concerns were raised that they too might cause adverse health effects."
2508,Extensive toxicological research on SVFs has demonstrated that their pulmonary effects are directly related to fiber dose in the lung over time.
2509,"This is the result of deposition (thin fibers deposit in the lower lung more efficiently than thick fibers) and lung-persistence (""biopersistence"" is directly related to fiber length and inversely related to dissolution and fragmentation rates)."
2510,"In rat inhalation studies, asbestos was determined to be 7- to 10-fold more biopersistent in the lung than SVFs."
2511,"Other than its effect on biopersistence, fiber composition did not appear to play a direct role in the biological activity of SVFs."
2512,"Recently, the utilization of man-made organic fibers (MMOFs) (also referred to by some as synthetic organic fibers) has increased rapidly for a variety of applications."
2513,"In contrast to SVFs, research on the potential pulmonary effects of MMOFs is relatively limited, because traditionally MMOFs were manufactured in diameters too thick to be respirable (inhalable into the lower lung)."
2514,"However, new developments in the MMOF industry have resulted in the production of increasingly fine-diameter fibers for special applications, and certain post-manufacturing processes (e.g., chopping) generate respirable-sized MMOF dust."
2515,"Until the mid-1990s, there was no consistent evidence of human health affects attributed to occupational exposure to MMOFs."
2516,"Very recently, however, a unique form of interstitial lung disease has been reported in nylon flock workers in three different plants, and respirable-sized nylon shreds (including fibers) were identified in workplace air samples."
2517,Whether nylon dust or other occupational exposures are responsible for the development of lung disease in these workers remains to be determined.
2518,It is also unknown whether the biological mechanisms that determine the respirability and toxicity of SVFs apply to MMOFs.
2519,"Thus, it is appropriate and timely to review the current data regarding MMOF workplace exposure and pulmonary health effects, including the database on epidemiological, exposure assessment, and toxicology studies.Sphingomonas sp."
2520,LB126 is able to utilize fluorene as sole source of carbon and energy.
2521,"In the present study, a mutagenic vector was constructed and a ""plasmid rescue"" strategy was set up to isolate a 16.5-kb DNA fragment containing genes required for fluorene degradation."
2522,A 14.5-kb portion of the cloned DNA was sequenced revealing thirteen open reading frames.
2523,Two encoded hypothetical proteins (FldE and FldY) similar to transcriptional regulators and one (ORF360) located on an IS-like element (ISSsp126) encoded a putative transposase.
2524,"Three other putative proteins (FldB, FldU and FldV) displayed strong similarity with enzymes of the protocatechuate 4,5-degradation pathway utilized by Sphingomonaspaucimobilis SYK-6 for the degradation of lignin breakdown products."
2525,The remaining hypothetical proteins displayed only limited similarity with enzyme sequences available from databases.
2526,Suicide plasmid-directed mutagenesis and genetic complementations showed that integrity of the protocatechuate catabolic pathway was an absolute requirement for fluorene degradation to proceed.
2527,These findings were further supported by the analysis of metabolites in bacterial culture supernatants obtained from appropriate mutants.
2528,"The results presented here demonstrated the suitability of the genetic tool constructed and supplied the first genetic evidence for the participation of a protocatechuate 4,5-degradation pathway in a bacterial fluorene degradation pathway.The occurrence of benzothiazoles in the environment seems to be restricted to aquatic compartments and is mainly associated with the manufacture and use of the rubber additive 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) and its derivatives."
2529,"Although data on benzothiazole biotransformations in natural environments at ppb and ppt levels are scarce, the unsubstituted benzothiazole (BT) and 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (OBT) are generally considered to be biodegradable, whereas 2-methylthiobenzothiazole is recalcitrant."
2530,"The fungicide 2-thiocyanomethylthiobenzothiazole is assumed to be hydrolysed to MBT, which is then further methylated."
2531,"At higher concentration levels, similar conclusions can generally be drawn."
2532,"In addition, BT, MBT, 2-aminobenzothiazole and benzothiazole-2-sulphonate can be biodegraded, although side- and end-products may form."
2533,"For BT and MBT, threshold concentration were reported above which inhibitory effects on biological treatment processes occur."
2534,"Due to the limited availability of axenic bacterial cultures capable of benzothiazole mineralization, only the initial steps of the degradation pathways have been elucidated so far.Anaerobic degradation of naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, and tetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) was investigated with a sulfate-reducing enrichment culture obtained from a contaminated aquifer."
2535,"Degradation studies with tetralin revealed 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid as a major metabolite indicating activation by addition of a C(1) unit to tetralin, comparable to the formation of 2-naphthoic acid in anaerobic naphthalene degradation."
2536,"The activation reaction was specific for the aromatic ring of tetralin; 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthoic acid was not detected."
2537,"The reduced 2-naphthoic acid derivatives tetrahydro-, octahydro-, and decahydro-2-naphthoic acid were identified consistently in supernatants of cultures grown with either naphthalene, 2-methylnaphthalene, or tetralin."
2538,"In addition, two common ring cleavage products were identified."
2539,Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-resolution GC-MS analyses revealed a compound with a cyclohexane ring and two carboxylic acid side chains as one of the first ring cleavage products.
2540,"The elemental composition was C(11)H(16)O(4) (C(11)H(16)O(4)-diacid), indicating that all carbon atoms of the precursor 2-naphthoic acid structure were preserved in this ring cleavage product."
2541,"According to the mass spectrum, the side chains could be either an acetic acid and a propenic acid, or a carboxy group and a butenic acid side chain."
2542,A further ring cleavage product was identified as 2-carboxycyclohexylacetic acid and was assumed to be formed by beta-oxidation of one of the side chains of the C(11)H(16)O(4)-diacid.
2543,"Stable isotope-labeling growth experiments with either (13)C-labeled naphthalene, per-deuterated naphthalene-d(8), or a (13)C-bicarbonate-buffered medium showed that the ring cleavage products derived from the introduced carbon source naphthalene."
2544,The series of identified metabolites suggests that anaerobic degradation of naphthalenes proceeds via reduction of the aromatic ring system of 2-naphthoic acid to initiate ring cleavage in analogy to the benzoyl-coenzyme A pathway for monoaromatic hydrocarbons.
2545,Our findings provide strong indications that further degradation goes through saturated compounds with a cyclohexane ring structure and not through monoaromatic compounds.
2546,"A metabolic pathway for anaerobic degradation of bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with 2-naphthoic acid as the central intermediate is proposed.Ethionamide (ETA), a prodrug that must undergo metabolic activation to exert its cytotoxic effects, is a second line drug against tuberculosis, a disease that infects more than a third of the world\'s population."
2547,"It has been proposed, on the basis of genetic experiments, that ETA is activated in Mycobacterium tuberculosis by the protein encoded by the gene Rv3854c (DeBarber, A. E., Mdluli, K., Bosman, M., Bekker, L.-G., and Barry, C. E., III (2000) Proc."

2555,"We report here the expression, purification, and characterization of the protein encoded by this gene."
2556,Our results establish that the enzyme (EtaA) is an FAD-containing enzyme that oxidizes ETA to the corresponding S-oxide.
2557,"The S-oxide, which has a similar biological activity as ETA, is further oxidized by EtaA to 2-ethyl-4-amidopyridine, presumably via the unstable doubly oxidized sulfinic acid intermediate."
2558,"This flavoenzyme also oxidizes thiacetazone, thiobenzamide, and isothionicotinamide and thus is probably responsible, as suggested by the observation of crossover resistance, for the oxidative activation of other thioamide antitubercular drugs.Cell-cell communication in bacteria is accomplished through the exchange of extracellular signalling molecules called autoinducers."
2559,"This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacterial populations to coordinate gene expression."
2560,"Community cooperation probably enhances the effectiveness of processes such as bioluminescence, virulence factor expression, antibiotic production and biofilm development."
2561,"Unlike other autoinducers, which are specific to a particular species of bacteria, a recently discovered autoinducer (AI-2) is produced by a large number of bacterial species."
2562,AI-2 has been proposed to serve as a \'universal\' signal for inter-species communication.
2563,"The chemical identity of AI-2 has, however, proved elusive."
2564,"Here we present the crystal structure of an AI-2 sensor protein, LuxP, in a complex with autoinducer."
2565,The bound ligand is a furanosyl borate diester that bears no resemblance to previously characterized autoinducers.
2566,Our findings suggest that addition of naturally occurring borate to an AI-2 precursor generates active AI-2.
2567,"Furthermore, they indicate a potential biological role for boron, an element required by a number of organisms but for unknown reasons.s-Triazine ring compounds are common industrial chemicals: pesticides, resin intermediates, dyes, and explosives."
2568,The fate of these compounds in the environment is directly correlated with the ability of microbes to metabolize them.
2569,Microbes metabolize melamine and the triazine herbicides such as atrazine via enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions.
2570,Hydrolytic removal of substituents on the s-triazine ring is catalyzed by enzymes from the amidohydrolase superfamily and yields cyanuric acid as an intermediate.
2571,Cyanuric acid is hydrolytically processed to yield 3 mol each of ammonia and carbon dioxide.
2572,"In those cases studied, the genes underlying the hydrolytic reactions are localized to large catabolic plasmids."
2573,"One such plasmid, pADP-1 from Pseudomonas sp."
2574,"ADP, has been completely sequenced and contains the genes for atrazine catabolism."
2575,Insertion sequence elements play a role in constructing different atrazine catabolic plasmids in different bacteria.
2576,Atrazine chlorohydrolase has been purified to homogeneity from two sources.
2577,Recombinant Escherichia coli strains expressing atrazine chlorohydrolase have been constructed and chemically cross-linked to generate catalytic particles used for atrazine remediation in soil.
2578,"The method was used for cleaning up a spill of 1,000 pounds of atrazine to attain a level of herbicide acceptable to regulatory agencies.Quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase is a copper-containing enzyme that catalyzes the insertion of molecular oxygen into polyphenolic flavonols."
2579,"Dioxygenation catalyzed by iron-containing enzymes has been studied extensively, but dioxygenases employing other metal cofactors are poorly understood."
2580,"We determined the crystal structure of quercetin 2,3-dioxygenase at 1.6 A resolution."
2581,"The enzyme forms homodimers, which are stabilized by an N-linked heptasaccharide at the dimer interface."
2582,"The mononuclear type 2 copper center displays two distinct geometries: a distorted tetrahedral coordination, formed by His66, His68, His112, and a water molecule, and a distorted trigonal bipyramidal environment, which additionally comprises Glu73."
2583,"Manual docking of the substrate quercetin into the active site showed that the different geometries of the copper site might be of catalytic importance.Rhodococcus (opacus) erythropolis HL PM-1 grows on 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid) or 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP) as sole nitrogen source."
2584,A gene cluster involved in picric acid degradation was recently identified.
2585,"The functional assignment of three of its genes, npdC, npdG and npdI, and the tentative functional assignment of a fourth one, npdH, is reported."
2586,The genes were expressed in Escherichia coli as His-tag fusion proteins that were purified by Ni-affinity chromatography.
2587,The enzyme activity of each protein was determined by spectrophotometry and HPLC analyses.
2588,"NpdI, a hydride transferase, catalyses a hydride transfer from reduced F420 to the aromatic ring of picric acid, generating the hydride sigma-complex (hydride Meisenheimer complex) of picric acid (H(-)-PA)."
2589,"Similarly, NpdI also transformed 2,4-DNP to the hydride sigma-complex of 2,4-DNP."
2590,"A second hydride transferase, NpdC catalysed a subsequent hydride transfer to H(-)-PA, to produce a dihydride sigma-complex of picric acid (2H(-)-PA)."
2591,"All three reactions required the activity of NpdG, an NADPH-dependent F420 reductase, for shuttling the hydride ions from NADPH to F420."
2592,"NpdH converted 2H(-)-PA to a hitherto unknown product, X."
2593,"The results show that npdC, npdG and npdI play a key role in the initial steps of picric acid degradation, and that npdH may prove to be important in the later stages.The anaerobic degradation pathway of the saturated hydrocarbon n-hexane in a denitrifying strain (HxN1) was examined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of derivatized extracts from cultures grown with unlabeled and deuterated substrate; several authentic standard compounds were included for comparison."
2594,The study was focused on possible reaction steps that follow the initial formation of (1-methylpentyl)succinate from n-hexane and fumarate.
2595,"4-Methyloctanoic, 4-methyloct-2-enoic, 2-methylhexanoic, 2-methylhex-2-enoic and 3-hydroxy-2-methylhexanoic acids (in addition to a few other methyl-branched acids) were detected in n-hexane-grown but not in n-hexanoate-grown cultures."
2596,Labeling indicated preservation of the original carbon chain of n-hexane in these acids.
2597,Tracing of the deuterium label of 3- d1-(1-methylpentyl)succinate in tentative subsequent products indicated a deuterium/carboxyl carbon exchange in the succinate moiety.
2598,This suggests that the metabolism of (1-methylpentyl)succinate employs reactions analogous to those in the established conversion of succinyl-CoA via methylmalonyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA.
2599,"Accordingly, a pathway is proposed in which (1-methylpentyl)succinate is converted to the CoA-thioester, rearranged to (2-methylhexyl)malonyl-CoA and decarboxylated (perhaps by a transcarboxylase) to 4-methyloctanoyl-CoA."
2600,The other identified fatty acids match with a further degradation of 4-methyloctanoyl-CoA via rounds of conventional beta-oxidation.
2601,"Such a pathway would also allow regeneration of fumarate (for n-hexane activation) from propionyl-CoA formed as intermediate and hence present a cyclic process.To provide the first nationwide reconnaissance of the occurrence of pharmaceuticals, hormones, and other organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) in water resources, the U.S. Geological Survey used five newly developed analytical methods to measure concentrations of 95 OWCs in water samples from a network of 139 streams across 30 states during 1999 and 2000."
2602,The selection of sampling sites was biased toward streams susceptible to contamination (i.e.
2603,downstream of intense urbanization and livestock production).
2604,"OWCs were prevalent during this study, being found in 80% of the streams sampled."
2605,"The compounds detected represent a wide range of residential, industrial, and agricultural origins and uses with 82 of the 95 OWCs being found during this study."
2606,"The most frequently detected compounds were coprostanol (fecal steroid), cholesterol (plant and animal steroid), N,N-diethyltoluamide (insect repellant), caffeine (stimulant), triclosan (antimicrobial disinfectant), tri(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (fire retardant), and 4-nonylphenol (nonionic detergent metabolite)."
2607,"Measured concentrations for this study were generally low and rarely exceeded drinking-water guidelines, drinking-water health advisories, or aquatic-life criteria."
2608,"Many compounds, however, do not have such guidelines established."
2609,"The detection of multiple OWCs was common for this study, with a median of seven and as many as 38 OWCs being found in a given water sample."
2610,Little is known about the potential interactive effects (such as synergistic or antagonistic toxicity) that may occur from complex mixtures of OWCs in the environment.
2611,"In addition, results of this study demonstrate the importance of obtaining data on metabolites to fully understand not only the fate and transport of OWCs in the hydrologic system but also their ultimate overall effect on human health and the environment.A bacterial strain, AN3, which was able to use aniline or acetanilide as sole carbon, nitrogen and energy sources was isolated from activated sludge and identified as Delftiasp."
2612,AN3.
2613,This strain was capable of growing on concentrations of aniline up to 53.8 mM (5000 mg/l).
2614,"Substituted anilines such as N-methylaniline, N, N-dimethylaniline, 2-methylaniline, 4-methylaniline, 2-chloroaniline, 3-chloroaniline, o-aminoaniline, m-aminoaniline, p-aminoaniline, and sulfanilic acid did not support the growth of strain AN3."
2615,"The optimal temperature and pH for growth and degradation of aniline were 30 degrees C and 7.0, respectively."
2616,"The activities of aniline dioxygenase, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase and other enzymes involved in aniline degradation were determined, and results indicated that all of them were inducible."
2617,"The K (m) and V (max) of aniline dioxygenase were 0.29 mM and 0.043 mmol/mg protein/min, respectively."
2618,"The K (m) and V (max) of catechol 2, 3-dioxygenase for catechol were 0.016 mM and 0.015 mmol/mg protein/min, respectively."
2619,"Based on the results obtained, a pathway for the degradation of aniline by Delftiasp."
2620,AN3 was proposed.
2621,"The importance of the strain to the operation of municipal wastewater treatment plants is discussed.Previous studies have demonstrated that reduced humic substances (HS) can be reoxidized by anaerobic bacteria such as Geobacter, Geothrix, and Wolinella species with a suitable electron acceptor; however, little is known of the importance of this metabolism in the environment."
2622,"Recently we investigated this metabolism in a diversity of environments including marine and aquatic sediments, forest soils, and drainage ditch soils."
2623,"Most-probable-number enumeration studies were performed using 2,6-anthrahydroquinone disulfonate (AHDS), an analog for reduced HS, as the electron donor with nitrate as the electron acceptor."
2624,Anaerobic organisms capable of utilizing reduced HS as an electron donor were found in all environments tested and ranged from a low of 2.31 x 10(1) in aquifer sediments to a high of 9.33 x 10(6) in lake sediments.
2625,As part of this study we isolated six novel organisms capable of anaerobic AHDS oxidation.
2626,All of the isolates coupled the oxidation of AHDS to the reduction of nitrate with acetate (0.1 mM) as the carbon source.
2627,"In the absence of cells, no AHDS oxidation was apparent, and in the absence of AHDS, no cell density increase was observed."
2628,"Generally, nitrate was reduced to N(2)."
2629,"Analysis of the AHDS and its oxidized form, 2,6-anthraquinone disulfonate (AQDS), in the medium during growth revealed that the anthraquinone was not being biodegraded as a carbon source and was simply being oxidized as an energy source."
2630,Determination of the AHDS oxidized and nitrate reduced accounted for 109% of the theoretical electron transfer.
2631,"In addition to AHDS, all of these isolates could also couple the oxidation of reduced humic substances to the reduction of nitrate."
2632,"No HS oxidation occurred in the absence of cells and in the absence of a suitable electron acceptor, demonstrating that these organisms were capable of utilizing natural HS as an energy source and that AHDS serves as a suitable analog for studying this metabolism."
2633,"Alternative electron donors included simple volatile fatty acids such as propionate, butyrate, and valerate as well as simple organic acids such as lactate and pyruvate."
2634,"Analysis of the complete sequences of the 16S rRNA genes revealed that the isolates were not closely related to each other and were phylogenetically diverse, with members in the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta subdivisions of the PROTEOBACTERIA: Most of the isolates were closely related to known genera not previously recognized for their ability to couple growth to HS oxidation, while one of the isolates represented a new genus in the delta subclass of the PROTEOBACTERIA: The results presented here demonstrate that microbial oxidation of HS is a ubiquitous metabolism in the environment."
2635,"This study represents the first description of HS-oxidizing isolates and demonstrates that microorganisms capable of HS oxidation are phylogenetically diverse.Phytotoxicity and cytotoxicity of 2,4-diaminotoluene (2,4-D), 4,4\'-methylenedianiline (4,4-D), and 1,6-hexanediamine (1,6-D) were investigated by observing the germination of young radish seeds and the viability of HeLa cells, respectively."
2636,"2,4-D showed the highest, 4,4-D intermediate, and 1,6-D lowest cytotoxicity."
2637,"However, the phytotoxicity decreased in the order of 4,4-D > 2,4-D > 1,6-D."
2638,"Contrary to the results previously reported, in the modified Sturm test the activated sludge degraded 2,4-D and 4,4-D as well as 1,6-D without any pre-acclimation."
2639,"Ochrobacterium antropi was isolated for degradation of 2,4-D and 4,4-D and Pseudomonas citronellolis for 1,6-D degradation."
2640,Thielevia sp.
2641,"was isolated as 2,4-D degrading fungus and Aspergillus sp."
2642,"as 4,4-D and 1,6-D degrading fungus."
2643,"The fungi degraded the diamines faster than the bacteria.4-Nonylphenols (NPs) are common products of biodegradation of a widely used group of nonionic surfactants, the nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs)."
2644,"These compounds are known to be persistent, toxic, and estrogen active."
2645,There is a worldwide scientific and public discussion on the potential consequences of human long term dietary exposure to such endocrine disrupters.
2646,Despite numerous determinations of NPs in environmental samples no systematical reports exist relating to concentrations of NPs in food.
2647,We analyzed NPs in 60 different foodstuff commercially available in Germany.
2648,The results indicate that NPs are ubiquitous in food.
2649,The concentrations of NPs on a fresh weight basis varied between 0.1 and 19.4 microg/kg regardless of the fat content of the foodstuff.
2650,"Based on data on German food consumption rates and these first analyses of NPs in food, the daily intake for an adult was calculated to be 7.5 microg/day NPs."
2651,"For infants exclusively fed with breast milk or infant formulas daily intakes of 0.2 microg/day and 1.4 microg/day NPs, respectively, can be estimated.Initial F420-dependent hydrogenation of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid) generated the hydride sigma-complex of picrate and finally the dihydride complex."
2652,"With 2,4-dinitrophenol the hydride sigma-complex of 2,4-dinitrophenol is generated."
2653,"The hydride transferring enzyme system showed activity against several substituted 2,4-dinitrophenols but not with mononitrophenols."
2654,A Km-value of 0.06 mM of the hydride transfer for picrate as substrate was found.
2655,"The pH optima of the NADPH-dependent F420 reductase and for the hydride transferase were 5.5 and 7.5, respectively."
2656,An enzymatic activity has been identified catalyzing the release of stoichometric amounts of 1 mol nitrite from 1 mol of the dihydride sigma-complex of picrate.
2657,This complex was synthesized by chemical reduction of picrate and characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy.
2658,"The hydride sigma-complex of 2,4-dinitrophenol has been identified as the denitration product."
2659,The nitrite-eliminating activity was enriched and clearly separated from the hydride transferring enzyme system by FPLC.
2660,"2,4-Dinitrophenol has been disproven as a metabolite of picrate (Ebert et al."
2661,"1999) and a convergent catabolic pathway for picrate and 2,4-dinitrophenol with the hydride sigma-complex of 2,4-dinitrophenol as the common intermediate has been demonstrated.We analyzed the kinetics and metabolic pathways of trichloroethylene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane degradation by the ethane-utilizing Mycobacterium sp."
2662,TA27.
2663,"The apparent Vmax and Km of trichloroethylene were 9.8 nmol min(-1) mg of cells(-1) and 61.9 microM, respectively."
2664,"The apparent Vmax and Km of 1,1,1-trichloroethane were 0.11 nmol min(-1) mg of cells(-1) and 3.1 microM, respectively."
2665,"2,2,2-trichloroethanol, trichloroacetic acid, chloral, and dichloroacetic acid were detected as metabolites of trichloroethylene."
2666,"2,2,2-trichloroethanol, trichloroacetic acid, and dichloroacetic acid were also detected as metabolites of 1,1,1-trichloroethane."
2667,"The amounts of 2,2,2-trichloroethanol, trichloroacetic acid, chloral, and dichloroacetic acid derived from the degradation of 3.60 micromol trichloroethylene were 0.16 micromol (4.4%), 0.11 micromol (3.1%), 0.02 micromol (0.6%), and 0.02 micromol (0.6%), respectively."
2668,"The amounts of 2,2,2-trichloroethanol, trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid derived from the degradation of 1.73 micromol 1,1,1-trichloroethane were 1.48 micromol (85.5%), 0.22 micromol (12.7%), and 0.02 micromol (1.2%), respectively."
2669,More than 90% of theoretical total chloride was released in trichloroethylene degradation.
2670,"Chloral and 2,2,2-trichloroethanol were transformed into each other, and were finally converted to trichloroacetic acid, and dichloroacetic acid."
2671,Trichloroacetic acid and dichloroacetic acid were not degraded by strain TA27.Methanogenesis from furfural by defined mixed cultures was studied.
2672,"Under sulfate-reducing conditions, a Desulfovibrio strain was used as the furfural-degrading species producing acetic acid."
2673,"This sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Desulfovibrio strain B is an incomplete oxidizer, unable to carry out the terminal oxidation of organic substrates, leaving acetic acid as the end product."
2674,Introduction of acetate-utilizing methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina barkeri 227 converted acetic acid to methane.
2675,This well-defined mixed consortium used furfural as its sole source of carbon and converted it to methane and CO(2).
2676,"In the mixed culture, when a methanogen inhibitor was used in the culture medium, furfural was converted to acetic acid by the Desulfovibrio strain B, but acetic acid did not undergo further metabolism."
2677,"On the other hand, when the growth of Desulfovibrio in the consortium was suppressed with a specific SRB inhibitor, namely molybdate, furfural was not degraded."
2678,"Thus, the metabolic activities of both Desulfovibrio strain B and M. barkeri 227 were essential for the complete degradation of furfural.Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) provide a powerful tool towards the one-pot synthesis of diverse and complex compounds on the one hand and small and \'drug-like\' heterocycles on the other hand."
2679,No other single synthesis technology enables chemists to search such large chemical spaces as provided by MCRs.
2680,MCRs that involve isocyanides are by far the most versatile reactions in terms of scaffolds and number of accessible compounds.A strain that efficiently degraded methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was obtained by initial selection on the recalcitrant compound tert-butyl alcohol (TBA).
2681,"This strain, a gram-positive methylotrophic bacterium identified as Mycobacterium austroafricanum IFP 2012, was also able to degrade tert-amyl methyl ether and tert-amyl alcohol."
2682,Ethyl tert-butyl ether was weakly degraded.
2683,"tert-Butyl formate and 2-hydroxy isobutyrate (HIBA), two intermediates in the MTBE catabolism pathway, were detected during growth on MTBE."
2684,A positive effect of Co2+ during growth of M. austroafricanum IFP 2012 on HIBA was demonstrated.
2685,"The specific rate of MTBE degradation was 0.6 mmol/h/g (dry weight) of cells, and the biomass yield on MTBE was 0.44 g (dry weight) per g of MTBE."
2686,"MTBE, TBA, and HIBA degradation activities were induced by MTBE and TBA, and TBA was a good inducer."
2687,"Involvement of at least one monooxygenase during degradation of MTBE and TBA was shown by (i) the requirement for oxygen, (ii) the production of propylene epoxide from propylene by MTBE- or TBA- grown cells, and (iii) the inhibition of MTBE or TBA degradation and of propylene epoxide production by acetylene."
2688,No cytochrome P-450 was detected in MTBE- or TBA-grown cells.
2689,Similar protein profiles were obtained after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of crude extracts from MTBE- and TBA-grown cells.
2690,"Among the polypeptides induced by these substrates, two polypeptides (66 and 27 kDa) exhibited strong similarities with known oxidoreductases.Metabolism of the phenylurea herbicide isoproturon by Sphingomonas sp."
2691,strain SRS2 was significantly enhanced when the strain was grown in coculture with a soil bacterium (designated strain SRS1).
2692,Both members of this consortium were isolated from a highly enriched isoproturon-degrading culture derived from an agricultural soil previously treated regularly with the herbicide.
2693,"Based on analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, strain SRS1 was assigned to the beta-subdivision of the proteobacteria and probably represents a new genus."
2694,"Strain SRS1 was unable to degrade either isoproturon or its known metabolites 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1-methylurea, 3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-urea, or 4-isopropyl-aniline."
2695,Pure culture studies indicate that Sphingomonas sp.
2696,SRS2 is auxotrophic and requires components supplied by association with other soil bacteria.
2697,"A specific mixture of amino acids appeared to meet these requirements, and it was shown that methionine was essential for Sphingomonas sp."
2698,SRS2.
2699,This suggests that strain SRS1 supplies amino acids to Sphingomonas sp.
2700,"SRS2, thereby leading to rapid metabolism of (14)C-labeled isoproturon to (14)CO(2) and corresponding growth of strain SRS2."
2701,Proliferation of strain SRS1 suggests that isoproturon metabolism by Sphingomonas sp.
2702,SRS2 provides unknown metabolites or cell debris that supports growth of strain SRS1.
2703,"The role of strain SRS1 in the consortium was not ubiquitous among soil bacteria; however, the indigenous soil microflora and some strains from culture collections also stimulate isoproturon metabolism by Sphingomonas sp."
2704,"strain SRS2 to a similar extent.Degradates of acetochlor and alachlor (ethanesulfonic acids, ESAs) were analyzed in both standards and in a groundwater sample using high-performance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization."
2705,The negative pseudomolecular ion of the secondary amide of acetochlor ESA and alachlor ESA gave average masses of 256.0750+/-0.0049 amu and 270.0786+/-0.0064 amu respectively.
2706,"Acetochlor and alachlor ESA gave similar masses of 314.1098+/-0.0061 amu and 314.1153+/-0.0048 amu; however, they could not be distinguished by accurate mass because they have the same empirical formula."
2707,"On the other hand, they may be distinguished using positive-ion electrospray because of different fragmentation spectra, which did not occur using negative-ion electrospray.The degradation of synthetic compounds requires bacteria to recruit and adapt enzymes from pathways for naturally occurring compounds."
2708,"Previous work defined the steps in 2,4-dinitrotoluene (2,4-DNT) metabolism through the ring fission reaction."
2709,The results presented here characterize subsequent steps in the pathway that yield the central metabolic intermediates pyruvate and propionyl coenzyme A (CoA).
2710,"The genes encoding the degradative pathway were identified within a 27-kb region of DNA cloned from Burkholderia cepacia R34, a strain that grows using 2,4-DNT as a sole carbon, energy, and nitrogen source."
2711,"Genes for the lower pathway in 2,4-DNT degradation were found downstream from dntD, the gene encoding the extradiol ring fission enzyme of the pathway."
2712,"The region includes genes encoding a CoA-dependent methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (dntE), a putative NADH-dependent dehydrogenase (ORF13), and a bifunctional isomerase/hydrolase (dntG)."
2713,"Results from analysis of the gene sequence, reverse transcriptase PCR, and enzyme assays indicated that dntD dntE ORF13 dntG composes an operon that encodes the lower pathway."
2714,"Additional genes that were uncovered encode the 2,4-DNT dioxygenase (dntAaAbAcAd), methylnitrocatechol monooxygenase (dntB), a putative LysR-type transcriptional (ORF12) regulator, an intradiol ring cleavage enzyme (ORF3), a maleylacetate reductase (ORF10), a complete ABC transport complex (ORF5 to ORF8), a putative methyl-accepting chemoreceptor protein (ORF11), and remnants from two transposable elements."
2715,"Some of the additional gene products might play as-yet-undefined roles in 2,4-DNT degradation; others appear to remain from recruitment of the neighboring genes."
2716,"The presence of the transposon remnants and vestigial genes suggests that the pathway for 2,4-DNT degradation evolved relatively recently because the extraneous elements have not been eliminated from the region.Naphthothiophene (NTH) is an asymmetric structural isomer of dibenzothiophene (DBT), and in addition to DBT derivatives, NTH derivatives can also be detected in diesel oil following hydrodesulfurization treatment."
2717,Rhodococcus sp.
2718,"strain WU-K2R was newly isolated from soil for its ability to grow in a medium with NTH as the sole source of sulfur, and growing cells of WU-K2R degraded 0.27 mM NTH within 7 days."
2719,"WU-K2R could also grow in the medium with NTH sulfone, benzothiophene (BTH), 3-methyl-BTH, or 5-methyl-BTH as the sole source of sulfur but could not utilize DBT, DBT sulfone, or 4,6-dimethyl-DBT."
2720,"On the other hand, WU-K2R did not utilize NTH or BTH as the sole source of carbon."
2721,"By gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, desulfurized NTH metabolites were identified as NTH sulfone, 2\'-hydroxynaphthylethene, and naphthofuran."
2722,"Moreover, since desulfurized BTH metabolites were identified as BTH sulfone, benzooxathiin S-oxide, benzooxathiin S,S-dioxide, o-hydroxystyrene, 2-(2\'-hydroxyphenyl)ethan-1-al, and benzofuran, it was concluded that WU-K2R desulfurized NTH and BTH through the sulfur-specific degradation pathways with the selective cleavage of carbon-sulfur bonds."
2723,"Therefore, Rhodococcus sp."
2724,"strain WU-K2R, which could preferentially desulfurize asymmetric heterocyclic sulfur compounds such as NTH and BTH through the sulfur-specific degradation pathways, is a unique desulfurizing biocatalyst showing properties different from those of DBT-desulfurizing bacteria.The htxA gene is required for the oxidation of hypophosphite in Pseudomonas stutzeri WM88 (Metcalf, W. W., and Wolfe, R. S. (1998) J. Bacteriol."
2725,"180, 5547-5558)."
2726,Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that hypophosphite:2-oxoglutarate dioxygenase (HtxA) is a novel member of the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase enzyme family.
2727,"To provide experimental support for this hypothesis, HtxA was overproduced in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity."
2728,"Recombinant HtxA is identical to the native enzyme based on amino terminus sequencing and mass spectral analysis, and it catalyzes the oxidation of hypophosphite to phosphite in a process strictly dependent on 2-oxoglutarate, ferrous ions, and oxygen."
2729,"Succinate and phosphite are stoichiometrically produced, indicating a strict coupling of the reaction."
2730,"Size exclusion analysis suggests that HtxA is active as a homodimer, and maximal activity is observed at pH 7.0 and at 27 degrees C. The apparent K(m) values for hypophosphite and 2-oxoglutarate were 0.58 +/- 0.04 mm and 10.6 +/- 1.4 microm, respectively."
2731,"V(max) and k(cat) values were determined to be 10.9 +/- 0.30 micromol min(-1) mg(-1) and 355 min(-1), respectively."
2732,2-Oxoadipate and pyruvate substitute poorly for 2-oxoglutarate as a cosubstrate.
2733,"The highest specific activity is observed with hypophosphite as substrate, but HtxA is also able to oxidize formate and arsenite at significant rates."
2734,"The substrate analog inhibitors, formate and nitrate, significantly reduce HtxA activity.Tuberculosis resurged in the late 1980s and now kills more than 2 million people a year."
2735,"The reemergence of tuberculosis as a potential public health threat, the high susceptibility of human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons to the disease, and the proliferation of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strains have created much scientific interest in developing new antimycobacterial agents to both treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains resistant to existing drugs, and shorten the duration of short-course treatment to improve patient compliance."
2736,Bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis is a proven target for new antibacterial drugs.
2737,"Mycolic acids, which are key components of the mycobacterial cell wall, are alpha-alkyl, beta-hydroxy fatty acids, with a species-dependent saturated ""short"" arm of 20-26 carbon atoms and a ""long"" meromycolic acid arm of 50-60 carbon atoms."
2738,"The latter arm is functionalized at regular intervals by cyclopropyl, alpha-methyl ketone, or alpha-methyl methylethers groups."
2739,"The mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway has been proposed to involve five distinct stages: (i) synthesis of C20 to C26 straight-chain saturated fatty acids to provide the alpha-alkyl branch; (ii) synthesis of the meromycolic acid chain to provide the main carbon backbone, (iii) modification of this backbone to introduce other functional groups; (iv) the final Claisen-type condensation step followed by reduction; and (v) various mycolyltransferase processes to cellular lipids."
2740,"The drugs shown to inhibit mycolic acid biosynthesis are isoniazid, ethionamide, isoxyl, thiolactomycin, and triclosan."
2741,"In addition, pyrazinamide was shown to inhibit fatty acid synthase type I which, in turn, provides precursors for fatty acid elongation to long-chain mycolic acids by fatty acid synthase II."
2742,Here we review the biosynthesis of mycolic acids and the mechanism of action of antimicrobial agents that act upon this pathway.
2743,"In addition, we describe molecular modeling studies on InhA, the bona-fide target for isoniazid, which should improve our understanding of the amino acid residues involved in the enzyme\'s mechanism of action and, accordingly, provide a rational approach to the design of new drugs.The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize a bacterium capable of metabolizing endosulfan.Ralstonia sp."
2744,"strain PS12 is able to use 2,4-, 2,5-, and 3,4-dichlorotoluene as growth substrates."
2745,"Dichloromethylcatechols are central intermediates that are formed by TecA tetrachlorobenzene dioxygenase-mediated activation at two adjacent unsubstituted carbon atoms followed by TecB chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase-catalyzed rearomatization and then are channeled into a chlorocatechol ortho cleavage pathway involving a chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase, chloromuconate cycloisomerase, and dienelactone hydrolase."
2746,"However, completely different metabolic routes were observed for the three dichloromethylcatechols analyzed."
2747,"Whereas 3,4-dichloro-6-methylcatechol is quantitatively transformed into one dienelactone (5-chloro-2-methyldienelactone) and thus is degraded via a linear pathway, 3,5-dichloro-2-methylmuconate formed from 4,6-dichloro-3-methylcatechol is subject to both 1,4- and 3,6-cycloisomerization and thus is degraded via a branched metabolic route."
2748,"3,6-Dichloro-4-methylcatechol, on the first view, is transformed predominantly into one (2-chloro-3-methyl-trans-) dienelactone."
2749,"In situ (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed the intermediate formation of 2,5-dichloro-4-methylmuconolactone, showing that both 1,4- and 3,6-cycloisomerization occur with this muconate and indicating a degradation of the muconolactone via a reversible cycloisomerization reaction and the dienelactone-forming branch of the pathway."
2750,Diastereomeric mixtures of two dichloromethylmuconolactones were prepared chemically to proof such a hypothesis.
2751,"Chloromuconate cycloisomerase transformed 3,5-dichloro-2-methylmuconolactone into a mixture of 2-chloro-5-methyl-cis- and 3-chloro-2-methyldienelactone, affording evidence for a metabolic route of 3,5-dichloro-2-methylmuconolactone via 3,5-dichloro-2-methylmuconate into 2-chloro-5-methyl-cis-dienelactone."
2752,"2,5-Dichloro-3-methylmuconolactone was transformed nearly exclusively into 2-chloro-3-methyl-trans-dienelactone.Two mutants of Tagetes erecta displaying aberrant thiophene composition were identified by screening more than 300 plants from a mutagenized M2 population using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of root extracts."
2753,"Both mutants, which may have originated from the same mutational event, contained high amounts of the C13 monothiophene 2-(but-3-en-1-ynyl)-5-(penta-1,3-diynyl)-thiophene that was previously not found in T. erecta and also high amounts of two C13 bithienyls that were absent or present at low concentrations in the wild type."
2754,The mutant phenotype was also expressed in 21 Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformed root clones derived from both mutants.
2755,Feeding experiments with root cultures derived from one mutant and from the wild type indicated that the monothiophene accumulating in the mutant is the common precursor for all bithienyl thiophenes in wild-type and mutant Tagetes erecta.
2756,These experiments also showed that one mutant is deficient in demethylation of the monothiophene.Isonitrile hydratase is a novel enzyme in Pseudomonas putida N19-2 that catalyzes the conversion of isonitriles to N-substituted formamides.
2757,"Based on N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences, a 535-bp DNA fragment corresponding to a portion of the isonitrile hydratase gene was amplified, which was used as a probe to clone a 6.4-kb DNA fragment containing the whole gene."
2758,"Sequence analysis of the 6.4-kb fragment revealed that the isonitrile hydratase gene (inhA) was 684 nucleotides long and encoded a protein with a molecular mass of 24,211 Da."
2759,Overexpression of inhA in Escherichia coli gave a large amount of soluble isonitrile hydratase exhibiting the same molecular and catalytic properties as the native enzyme from the Pseudomonas strain.
2760,"The predicted amino acid sequence of inhA showed low similarity to that of an intracellular protease in Pyrococcus horikoshii (PH1704), and an active cysteine residue in the protease was conserved in the isonitrile hydratase at the corresponding position (Cys-101)."
2761,"A mutant enzyme containing Ala instead of Cys-101 did not exhibit isonitrile hydratase activity at all, demonstrating the essential role of this residue in the catalytic function.Two new genes whose products are involved in biodegradation of the organic solvent tetralin were identified."
2762,"These genes, designated thnE and thnF, are located downstream of the previously identified thnD gene and code for a hydratase and an aldolase, respectively."
2763,A sequence comparison of enzymes similar to ThnE showed the significant similarity of hydratases involved in biodegradation pathways to 4-oxalocrotonate decarboxylases and established four separate groups of related enzymes.
2764,"Consistent with the sequence information, characterization of the reaction catalyzed by ThnE showed that it hydrated a 10-carbon dicarboxylic acid."
2765,"The only reaction product detected was the enol tautomer, 2,4-dihydroxydec-2-ene-1,10-dioic acid."
2766,The aldolase ThnF showed significant similarity to aldolases involved in different catabolic pathways whose substrates are dihydroxylated dicarboxylic acids and which yield pyruvate and a semialdehyde.
2767,The reaction products of the aldol cleavage reaction catalyzed by ThnF were identified as pyruvate and the seven-carbon acid pimelic semialdehyde.
2768,"ThnF and similar aldolases showed conservation of the active site residues identified by the crystal structure of 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-galactarate aldolase, a class II aldolase with a novel reaction mechanism, suggesting that these similar enzymes are class II aldolases."
2769,"In contrast, ThnF did not show similarity to 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolases of other biodegradation pathways, which are significantly larger and apparently are class I aldolases.Pseudomonas sp."
2770,"50432 biotransformed a highly toxic pesticide, carbofuran (2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethylbenzofuran-7-yl methylcarbamate) to 7-phenol (2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-hydroxy benzofuran) and several unknown metabolites."
2771,"One of the unknown metabolites identified by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy was 4-hydroxycarbofuran (2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-4-hydroxybenzofuran-7-yl methylcarbamate)."
2772,It had a mass (237) similar to 3-hydroxycarbofuran and 5-hydroxycarbofuran but different fragmentation patterns.
2773,"This is the first report in which an inducible oxidative enzyme, hydroxylase, mediated the conversion of carbofuran to 4-hydroxycarbofuran."
2774,"A second constitutively synthesized enzyme hyrolase transformed carbofuran to 7-phenol.Batch kinetic and inhibition studies were performed for the aerobic cometabolism of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (1,1,1-TCA), 1,1-dichloroethylene (1,1-DCE), and 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA) by a butane-grown mixed culture."
2775,These chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) are often found together as cocontaminants in groundwater.
2776,The maximum degradation rates (k(max)) and half-saturation coefficients (K(s)) were determined in single compound kinetic tests.
2777,"The highest k(max) was obtained for butane (2.6 micromol/mg TSS/h) followed by 1,1-DCE (1.3 micromol/mg TSS/h), 1,1-DCA (0.49 micromol/mg TSS/h), and 1,1,1-TCA (0.19 micromol/mg TSS/h), while the order of K(s) from the highest to lowest was 1,1-DCA (19 microM), butane (19 microM), 1,1,1-TCA (12 microM) and 1,1-DCE (1.5 microM)."
2778,"The inhibition types were determined using direct linear plots, while inhibition coefficients (K(ic) and K(iu)) were estimated by nonlinear least squares regression (NLSR) fits to the kinetic model of the identified inhibition type."
2779,Two different inhibition types were observed among the compounds.
2780,"Competitive inhibition among CAHs was indicated from direct linear plots, and the CAHs also competitively inhibited butane utilization."
2781,"1,1-DCE was a stronger inhibitor than the other CAHs."
2782,"Mixed inhibition of 1,1,1-TCA, 1,1-DCA, and 1,1-DCE transformations by butane was observed."
2783,"Thus, both competitive and mixed inhibitions are important in cometabolism of CAHs by this butane culture."
2784,"For competitive inhibition between CAHs, the ratio of the K(s) values was a reasonable indicator of competitive inhibition observed."
2785,"Butane was a strong inhibitor of CAH transformation, having a much lower inhibition coefficient than the K(s) value of butane, while the CAHs were weak inhibitors of butane utilization."
2786,Model simulations of reactor systems where both the growth substrate and the CAHs are present indicate that reactor performance is significantly affected by inhibition type and inhibition coefficients.
2787,"Thus, determining inhibition type and measuring inhibition coefficients is important in designing CAH treatment systems.1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCA) is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant because of its widespread use as an industrial solvent, its improper disposal, and its substantial emission to the atmosphere."
2788,"We report the isolation of an anaerobic bacterium, strain TCA1, that reductively dechlorinates TCA to 1,1-dichloroethane and chloroethane."
2789,"Strain TCA1 required H2 as an electron donor and TCA as an electron acceptor for growth, indicating that dechlorination is a respiratory process."
2790,"Phylogenetic analysis indicated that strain TCA1 is related to gram-positive bacteria with low DNA G+C content and that its closest relative is Dehalobacter restrictus, an obligate H2-oxidizing, chloroethene-respiring bacterium.\'Pseudomonas butanovora\' is capable of growth with butane via the oxidation of butane to 1-butanol, which is catalysed by a soluble butane monooxygenase (sBMO)."
2791,In vitro oxidation of ethylene (an alternative substrate for sBMO) was reconstituted in the soluble portion of cell extracts and was NADH-dependent.
2792,Butane monooxygenase was separated into three components which were obligately required for substrate oxidation.
2793,The N-terminal sequences of the peptides associated with butane monooxygenase led to the cloning and sequencing of the 5797 nucleotide bmo gene cluster.
2794,"Comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequences with other multicomponent monooxygenases suggest that sBMO is a multimeric hydroxylase with 61, 45 and 19 kDa subunits encoded by bmoXYZ, a 40 kDa oxidoreductase encoded by bmoC, and a 15 kDa regulatory protein encoded by bmoB."
2795,"A sixth structural gene (bmoD) encodes a 9.6 kDa protein with similarity exclusively to mmoD (orfY), a putative metal centre assembly protein of the soluble methane monooxygenases."

2797,butanovora\' strain incapable of growth with butane.
2798,A putative promoter element characteristic of promoters associated with sigma(54)-dependent transcription initiation was located upstream of the bmo genes.

2801,"butanovora\' aligns most closely with non-haem carboxylate-bridged diiron monooxygenases and, moreover, contains the characteristic iron-binding motif."
2802,The structural and mechanistic implications of the high sequence identity (up to 64%) between the peptides of butane monooxygenase and methane monooxygenases are discussed.The pathway for biodegradation of benzothiazole (BT) and 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (OBT) by Rhodococcus pyridinovorans strain PA was studied in detail.
2803,The kinetics of biodegradation were monitored by in situ (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in parallel with reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
2804,Successive oxidations from BT to OBT and then from OBT to dihydroxybenzothiazole were observed.
2805,Further insight was obtained by using a mutant strain with impaired ability to grow on BT and OBT.
2806,The precise structure of another intermediate was determined by in situ two-dimensional (1)H-(13)C NMR and HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; this intermediate was found to be a ring-opening product (a diacid structure).
2807,"Detection of this metabolite, together with the results obtained by (1)H and (19)F NMR when cells were incubated with 3-fluorocatechol, demonstrated that a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase is involved in a pathway for biodegradation of BTs in this Rhodococcus strain."
2808,"Our results show that catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activities may both be involved in the biodegradation of BTs depending on the culture conditions.The gram-positive bacterium Mycobacterium sp."
2809,strain ESD is able to use the cyclodiene insecticide endosulfan as a source of sulfur for growth.
2810,This activity is dependent on the absence of sulfite or sulfate in the growth medium.
2811,"A cosmid library of strain ESD DNA was constructed in a Mycobacterium-Escherichia coli shuttle vector and screened for endosulfan-degrading activity in Mycobacterium smegmatis, a species that does not degrade endosulfan."
2812,"Using this method, we identified a single cosmid that conferred sulfur-dependent endosulfan-degrading activity on the host strain."
2813,"An open reading frame (esd) was identified within this cosmid that, when expressed behind a constitutive promoter in a mycobacterial expression vector, conferred sulfite- and sulfate-independent beta-endosulfan degradation activity on the recombinant strain."
2814,"The translation product of this gene (Esd) had up to 50% sequence identity with an unusual family of monooxygenase enzymes that use reduced flavins, provided by a separate flavin reductase enzyme, as cosubstrates."
2815,An additional partial open reading frame was located upstream of the Esd gene that had sequence homology to the same monooxygenase family.
2816,"A flavin reductase gene, identified in the M. smegmatis genome, was cloned, expressed, and used to provide reduced flavin mononucleotide for Esd in enzyme assays."
2817,"Thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography analyses of the enzyme assay mixtures revealed the disappearance of beta-endosulfan and the appearance of the endosulfan metabolites, endosulfan monoaldehyde and endosulfan hydroxyether."
2818,This suggests that Esd catalyzes the oxygenation of beta-endosulfan to endosulfan monoaldehyde and endosulfan hydroxyether.
2819,"Esd did not degrade either alpha-endosulfan or the metabolite of endosulfan, endosulfan sulfate.Mycobacterium sp."
2820,strain LB501T utilizes anthracene as a sole carbon and energy source.
2821,We analyzed cultures of the wild-type strain and of UV-generated mutants impaired in anthracene utilization for metabolites to determine the anthracene degradation pathway.
2822,Identification of metabolites by comparison with authentic standards and transient accumulation of o-phthalic acid by the wild-type strain during growth on anthracene suggest a pathway through o-phthalic acid and protocatechuic acid.
2823,"As the only productive degradation pathway known so far for anthracene proceeds through 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and the naphthalene degradation pathway to form salicylate, this indicates the existence of a novel anthracene catabolic pathway in Mycobacterium sp."
2824,"LB501T.Endosulfan (6,7,8,9,10,10-hexachloro-1,5,5a,6,9,9a-hexahydro-6,9-methano-2,3,4-benzo-dioxathiepin-3-oxide) is a cyclodiene organochlorine currently used as an insecticide all over the world and its residues are posing a serious environmental threat."
2825,"This study reports the isolation and identification of enriched microorganisms, capable of degrading endosulfan."
2826,Enrichment was achieved by using the insecticide as either the sole source of carbon or sulfur in parallel studies.
2827,Two strains each of fungi (F1 and F4) and bacteria (BF2 and B4) were selected using endosulfan as a sole carbon source.
2828,A Pandoraea species (Lin-3) previously isolated in our laboratory using lindane (gamma-HCH) as a carbon source was also screened for endosulfan degradation.
2829,"F1 and F4 (Fusarium ventricosum) degraded alpha-endosulfan by as much as 82.2 and 91.1% and beta-endosulfan by 78.5 and 89.9%, respectively, within 15 d of incubation."
2830,"Bacterial strains B4 and Lin-3 degraded alpha-endosulfan up to 79.6 and 81.8% and beta-endosulfan up to 83.9 and 86.8%, respectively, in 15 d. Among the bacterial strains isolated by providing endosulfan as a sulfur source, B4s and F4t degraded alpha-endosulfan by as much as 70.4 and 68.5% and beta-endosulfan by 70.4 and 70.8%, respectively, after 15 d. Degradation of the insecticide occurred concomitant with bacterial growth reaching an optical density (OD600) of 0.366 and 0.322 for B4 and Lin-3, respectively."
2831,High OD600 was also noted with the other bacterial strains utilizing endosulfan as a sulfur source.
2832,Fungal and bacterial strains significantly decreased the pH of the nutrient culture media while growing on endosulfan.
2833,"The results of this study suggest that these novel strains are a valuable source of potent endosulfan-degrading enzymes for use in enzymatic bioremediation.The initial reactions in the cometabolic oxidation of the gasoline oxygenate, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), by Mycobacterium vaccae JOB5 have been characterized."
2834,"Two products, tert-butyl formate (TBF) and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), rapidly accumulated extracellularly when propane-grown cells were incubated with MTBE."
2835,"Lower rates of TBF and TBA production from MTBE were also observed with cells grown on 1- or 2-propanol, while neither product was generated from MTBE by cells grown on casein-yeast extract-dextrose broth."
2836,Kinetic studies with propane-grown cells demonstrated that TBF is the dominant (> or = 80%) initial product of MTBE oxidation and that TBA accumulates from further biotic and abiotic hydrolysis of TBF.
2837,Our results suggest that the biotic hydrolysis of TBF is catalyzed by a heat-stable esterase with activity toward several other tert-butyl esters.
2838,"Propane-grown cells also oxidized TBA, but no further oxidation products were detected."
2839,"Like the oxidation of MTBE, TBA oxidation was fully inhibited by acetylene, an inactivator of short-chain alkane monooxygenase in M. vaccae JOB5."
2840,Oxidation of both MTBE and TBA was also inhibited by propane (K(i) = 3.3 to 4.4 microM).
2841,"Values for K(s) of 1.36 and 1.18 mM and for V(max) of 24.4 and 10.4 nmol min(-1) mg of protein(-1) were derived for MTBE and TBA, respectively."
2842,We conclude that the initial steps in the pathway of MTBE oxidation by M. vaccae JOB5 involve two reactions catalyzed by the same monooxygenase (MTBE and TBA oxidation) that are temporally separated by an esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of TBF to TBA.
2843,These results that suggest the initial reactions in MTBE oxidation by M. vaccae JOB5 are the same as those that we have previously characterized in gaseous alkane-utilizing fungi.Microbial metabolism of organosulfur compounds is of interest in the petroleum industry for in-field viscosity reduction and desulfurization.
2844,"Here, dibenzyl sulfide (DBS) metabolism in white rot fungi was studied."
2845,"Trametes trogii UAMH 8156, Trametes hirsuta UAMH 8165, Phanerochaete chrysosporium ATCC 24725, Trametes versicolor IFO 30340 (formerly Coriolus sp."
2846,"), and Tyromyces palustris IFO 30339 all oxidized DBS to dibenzyl sulfoxide prior to oxidation to dibenzyl sulfone."
2847,The cytochrome P-450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole eliminated dibenzyl sulfoxide oxidation.
2848,"Laccase activity (0.15 U/ml) was detected in the Trametes cultures, and concentrated culture supernatant and pure laccase catalyzed DBS oxidation to dibenzyl sulfoxide more efficiently in the presence of 2,2\'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) than in its absence."
2849,These data suggest that the first oxidation step is catalyzed by extracellular enzymes but that subsequent metabolism is cytochrome P-450 mediated.This study assesses the role of the blue-green algal species present in the soil in the dissipation of endosulfan and its metabolites in the soil environment.
2850,"Two Anabaena species, Anabaena sp."
2851,"PCC 7120 and Anabaena flos-aquae, were used in this study."
2852,Anabaena sp.
2853,"PCC 7120 produced three principal biotransformation compounds, chiefly endosulfan diol (endodiol), and minor amounts of endosulfan hydroxyether and endosulfan lactone."
2854,Trace amounts of endosulfan sulfate were detected.
2855,"In comparison, the biotransformation of endosulfan by Anabaena flos-aquae yielded mainly endodiol with minor amounts of endosulfan sulfate."
2856,An unknown compound was produced up to 70% from endosulfan spiked in the medium inoculated by A. flos-aquae after 8 days of incubation.
2857,"Therefore, the endosulfan fate was dependent on the species."
2858,"Within 1 day of incubation, two Anabaena species produced low amounts of beta-endosulfan after application of alpha-endosulfan."
2859,These results suggest the presence of isomerase in the Anabaena species.
2860,Further studies using a fermentor to control the medium pH at 7.2 to minimize chemical hydrolysis of endosulfan revealed a major production of endodiol with minor amounts of endosulfan sulfate and the unknown compound.
2861,These results showed that the production of the unknown compound might be dependent on the alkaline pH in the medium and that the production of endodiol by A. flos-aquae might be biologically controlled.
2862,"This study showed that two algal species could contribute in the detoxification pathways of endosulfan in the soil environment.A unique metabolite with a molecular mass of 119 Da (C(2)H(5)N(3)O(3)) accumulated during biotransformation of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) by Rhodococcus sp."

2870,"Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that a cytochrome P450 enzyme was responsible for RDX biotransformation by strain DN22."
2871,"A cytochrome P450 2B4 from rabbit liver catalyzed a very similar biotransformation of RDX to 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal."
2872,Both the cytochrome P450 2B4 and intact cells of Rhodococcus sp.
2873,strain DN22 catalyzed the release of two nitrite ions from each reacted RDX molecule.
2874,A comparative study of cytochrome P450 2B4 and Rhodococcus sp.
2875,strain DN22 revealed substantial similarities in the product distribution and inhibition by cytochrome P450 inhibitors.
2876,"The experimental evidence led us to propose that cytochrome P450 2B4 can catalyze two single electron transfers to RDX, thereby causing double denitration, which leads to spontaneous hydrolytic ring cleavage and decomposition to produce 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal."
2877,Our results provide strong evidence that a cytochrome P450 enzyme is the key enzyme responsible for RDX biotransformation by Rhodococcus sp.
2878,strain DN22.The 2-nitrobenzoic acid degradation pathway of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain KU-7 proceeds via a novel 3-hydroxyanthranilate intermediate.
2879,"In this study, we cloned and sequenced a 19-kb DNA locus of strain KU-7 that encompasses the 3-hydroxyanthranilate meta-cleavage pathway genes."
2880,"The gene cluster, designated nbaEXHJIGFCDR, is organized tightly and in the same direction."
2881,"The nbaC and nbaD gene products were found to be novel homologs of the eukaryotic 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase and 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde decarboxylase, respectively."
2882,"The NbaC enzyme carries out the oxidation of 3-hydroxyanthranilate to 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde, while the NbaD enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of the latter compound to 2-aminomuconate-6-semialdehyde."
2883,The NbaC and NbaD proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and characterized.
2884,The substrate specificity of the 23.8-kDa NbaC protein was found to be restricted to 3-hydroxyanthranilate.
2885,"In E. coli, this enzyme oxidizes 3-hydroxyanthranilate with a specific activity of 8 U/mg of protein."
2886,Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed the essential role of two conserved histidine residues (His52 and His96) in the NbaC sequence.
2887,"The NbaC activity is also dependent on the presence of Fe(2+) but is inhibited by other metal ions, such as Zn(2+), Cu(2+), and Cd(2+)."
2888,"The NbaD protein was overproduced as a 38.7-kDa protein, and its specific activity towards 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate-6-semialdehyde was 195 U/mg of protein."
2889,"Further processing of 2-aminomuconate-6-semialdehyde to pyruvic acid and acetyl coenzyme A was predicted to proceed via the activities of NbaE, NbaF, NbaG, NbaH, NbaI, and NbaJ."

2896,strain K1 was cloned and sequenced.
2897,Analysis of a 9.2-kb DNA fragment revealed eight ORFs.

2901,A succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase activity was specifically expressed in tetrahydrofuran-grown cells.
2902,N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified protein revealed that it is encoded by sad.
2903,Northern blot analysis indicated that transcription of the thm genes and sad was specifically induced during growth on tetrahydrofuran.
2904,"Mono-, di- and polycistronic transcripts of these genes were detected."
2905,"Primer-extension analysis identified transcriptional start sites 37, 61, and 41 bp upstream of the translation start of sad, thmA, and thmB, respectively."

2909,"However, it could grow on benzyl alcohol, 2- and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol."
2910,"Metabolic studies suggest that the benzyl alcohol metabolism proceeds via the benzaldehyde, benzoate, and catechol ortho-cleavage pathway, in contrast to the well established catechol meta-cleavage pathway."
2911,Carbon source-dependent enzyme activity studies suggest that the degradation of aromatic alcohol involves two regulons.
2912,"Aromatic alcohol induces the upper regulon, which codes for aromatic alcohol- and aromatic aldehyde-dehydrogenase and converts alcohol into acid."
2913,The aromatic acid so generated induces the specific lower regulon and is metabolized via either the ortho- or the meta-cleavage pathway.
2914,"CSV86 cells transform 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene to 1- and 2-hydroxymethyl naphthalene, which are further converted to the respective naphthoic acids due to the basal level expression and broad substrate specificity of the upper regulon enzymes."
2915,"The incorporation of -isobutylhydroxylamine into the antibiotic valanimycin by Streptomyces viridifaciens has been shown to proceed with loss of the (18)O label, thereby demonstrating that the azoxy oxygen atom of valanimycin is not derived from the oxygen atom of isobutylhydroxylamine.The reduction of allylic thiols to alkenes by hydrogen sulfide in aqueous solutions, a novel reaction that may explain reduction processes widely occurring in natural environments, has been discovered."
2916,"Its mechanism has been studied and suggested to follow an S(RN)1-like pathway involving radical intermediates undergoing 1,4 hydrogen shifts."
2917,A genetic analysis of the anthranilate pathway of quinaldine degradation was performed.
2918,A 23-kb region of DNA from Arthrobacter ilicis R\xc3\xbc61a was cloned into the cosmid pVK100.
2919,"Although Escherichia coli clones containing the recombinant cosmid did not transform quinaldine, cosmids harboring the 23-kb region, or a 10.8-kb stretch of this region, conferred to Pseudomonas putida KT2440 the ability to cometabolically convert quinaldine to anthranilate."
2920,"The 10.8-kb fragment thus contains the genes coding for quinaldine 4-oxidase (Qox), 1H-4-oxoquinaldine 3-monooxygenase, 1H-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase, and N-acetylanthranilate amidase."
2921,"The qoxLMS genes coding for the molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide-(MCD-), FeSI-, FeSII-, and FAD-containing Qox were inserted into the expression vector pJB653, generating pKP1."
2922,"Qox is the first MCD-containing enzyme to be synthesized in a catalytically fully competent form by a heterologous host, P. putida KT2440 pKP1; the catalytic properties and the UV-visible and EPR spectra of Qox purified from P. putida KT2440 pKP1 were essentially like those of wild-type Qox."
2923,This provides a starting point for the construction of protein variants of Qox by site-directed mutagenesis.
2924,"Downstream of the qoxLMS genes, a putative gene whose deduced amino acid sequence showed 37% similarity to the cofactor-inserting chaperone XdhC was located."
2925,"Additional open reading frames identified on the 23-kb segment may encode further enzymes (a glutamyl tRNA synthetase, an esterase, two short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases, an ATPase belonging to the AAA family, a 2-hydroxyhepta-2,4-diene-1,7-dioate isomerase/5-oxopent-3-ene-1,2,5-tricarboxylate decarboxylase-like protein, and an enzyme of the mandelate racemase group) and hypothetical proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, and metabolite transport.2-(2\'-Hydroxyphenyl)benzene sulfinate (HPBSi) desulfinase (TdsB), which catalyzes the final step of desulfurization of dibenzothiophene (DBT), was purified from a thermophilic DBT- and benzothiophene (BT)-desulfurizing bacterium: Paenibacillus sp."
2926,strain A11-2.
2927,"The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 31 kDa and 39 kDa by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, respectively, suggesting a monomeric structure."
2928,"The optimal temperature and pH for the reaction involving TdsB was 55 degrees C and the enzyme was more resistant to heat treatment than DszB, a counterpart purified from Rhodococcus erythropolis."
2929,The optimum pH for TdsB activity was pH 8.
2930,TdsB converted HPBSi to 2-hydroxybiphenyl (2-HBP) and sulfite stoichiometrically.
2931,"The Km and kcat values for HPBSi were 0.33 mM and 0.32 s(-1), respectively."
2932,"TdsB was inactivated by SH reagents such as p-chloromercuribenzoic acid and 5,5\'-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid, but was not inhibited by chelating reagents such as EDTA and o-phenanthroline."
2933,"TdsB was also inhibited by o-hydroxystyrene, the final desulfurized product of BT."
2934,"However, 2-HBP and its derivatives showed only a weak inhibitory effect."
2935,"TdsB desulfurized 2-(2\'-hydroxyphenyl)ethen-1-sulfinate to yield o-hydroxystyrene, but DszB could not."
2936,A site-directed mutagenesis study revealed the cysteine residue at position 17 to be essential to the catalytic activity of TdsB.The environmental distribution of fluorinated organic compounds (FOCs) has been less well described than the other halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorinated and brominated compounds.
2937,This is despite the fact that FOCs have been used in a wide variety of products and applications for more than 50 years.
2938,"FOCs are resistant to hydrolysis, photolysis, microbial degradation, or metabolism by vertebrates due to the high energy of carbon-fluorine bond."
2939,"In particular, perfluorinated (fully fluorinated) compounds (PFCs) have the potential to persist in the environment."
2940,"But, until recently, the extent and magnitude of environmental distribution of PFCs was unknown."
2941,"Recent development of an analytical technique for PFCs using high performance liquid chromatography-negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESMSMS) permitted the survey of PFCs in livers and blood plasma of wildlife on a global scale.Solutions of alpha-endosulfan, beta-endosulfan, and technical grade endosulfan (70alpha:30beta) were added to modular estuarine mesocosms; the kinetics and degradation products from each mesocosm are reported."
2942,"The persistent product endosulfan sulfate was generated in all cases; however, its yield was approximately a factor of three higher from alpha-endosulfan relative to beta-endosulfan."
2943,"Beta-endosulfan hydrolyzed faster than alpha-endosulfan to endosulfan diol, which then rapidly degraded to endosulfan ether, endosulfan alpha-hydroxyether (major product), and endosulfan lactone."
2944,"The ring-opened form of the lactone, endosulfan gamma-hydroxycarboxylate, is reported for the first time; it appears to be a terminal product, at least over the timescale of the experiment."
2945,"The equilibrium between endosulfan gamma-hydroxycarboxylate and endosulfan lactone is dependent on pH, as only the protonated form of the gamma-hydroxy acid undergoes ring-closure."
2946,"The pKa of the gamma-hydroxy acid was determined to be 5.7, implying that the lactone will quickly open and deprontonate under environmentally relevant conditions.Arthrobacter sp."
2947,strain PBA metabolized phenylboronic acid to phenol.
2948,The oxygen atom in phenol was shown to be derived from the atmosphere using (18)O(2).
2949,"1-Naphthalene-, 2-naphthalene-, 3-cyanophenyl-, 2,5-fluorophenyl-, and 3-thiophene-boronic acids were also transformed to monooxygenated products."
2950,The oxygen atom in the product was bonded to the ring carbon atom originally bearing the boronic acid substituent with all the substrates tested.Microbial activity of an anthracene-spiked soil mixed with kitchen waste during laboratory composting at 56-59 degrees C was studied using an in-vessel technology.
2951,The effect of old compost containing acclimated microorganisms on the composting efficiency was also investigated.
2952,"Microbial succession, microbial enzyme activity, microbial diversity and anthracene removal rate were analyzed during 42 days of composting."
2953,"The results demonstrated that inoculating with old compost increased the amounts of thermophilic microorganisms, but did not significantly increase anthracene removal."
2954,A microbial succession from mesophilic bacteria to thermophilic bacteria and thermophilic actinomycetes was observed during composting.
2955,Polyphenol oxidase activity decreased while catalase activity varied irregularly.
2956,"Microbial diversity increased drastically when temperature elevated from 35 to 56 degrees C, but decreased when temperature maintained at 56-59 degrees C.The degradation of alpha and beta isomers of endosulfan by a two-member bacterial co-culture was studied."
2957,"Results were similar whether the two isomers were present individually or together, as in technical endosulfan."
2958,The degradation of both isomers was accompanied by the formation of endosulfan diol and endosulfan lactone.
2959,"Accumulation of the metabolite, endosulfan sulfate was, however, not observed during the reaction with either of the isomers."
2960,The microbial degradation of endosulfan isomers was also accompanied by a decrease in its toxicity to the test organism Tubifex tubifex M\xc3\xbcller.Burkholderia sp.
2961,"strain AK-5 utilized 4-aminophenol as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source."
2962,A pathway for the metabolism of 4-aminophenol in strain AK-5 was proposed based on the identification of three key metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.
2963,"Strain AK-5 converted 4-aminophenol to 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene via 1,4-benzenediol."
2964,"1,2,4-Trihydroxybenzene 1,2-dioxygenase cleaved the benzene ring of 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene to form maleylacetic acid."
2965,"The enzyme showed a high dioxygenase activity only for 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene, with K(m) and V(max) values of 9.6 micro M and 6.8 micro mol min(-1) mg of protein(-1), respectively.Woolfolk, C. A."

2972,"Chemical and manometric data indicate that the following reductions are essentially quantitative: arsenate to arsenite, pentavalent and trivalent bismuth to the free element, selenite via elemental selenium to selenide, tellurate and tellurite to tellurium, lead dioxide and manganese dioxide to the divalent state, ferric to ferrous iron, osmium tetroxide to osmate ion, osmium dioxide and trivalent osmium to the metal, uranyl uranium to the tetravalent state, vanadate to the level of vanadyl, and polymolybdate ions to molybdenum blues with an average valence for molybdenum of +5."
2973,The results of a study of certain other hydrogenase-containing bacteria with respect to their ability to carry out some of the same reactions are also presented.1.
2974,"Phenanthrene is oxidatively metabolized by soil pseudomonads through trans-3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxyphenanthrene to 3,4-dihydroxyphenanthrene, which then undergoes cleavage."
2975,2
2976,"Some properties of the ring-fission product, cis-4-(1-hydroxynaphth-2-yl)-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid, are described."
2977,The Fe(2+)-dependent oxygenase therefore disrupts the bond between C-4 and the angular C of the phenanthrene nucleus.
2978,3
2979,An enzyme of the aldolase type converts the fission product into 1-hydroxy-2-naphthaldehyde (2-formyl-1-hydroxynaphthalene).
2980,"An NAD-specific dehydrogenase is also present in the cell-free extract, which oxidizes the aldehyde to 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid."
2981,"This is then oxidatively decarboxylated to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, thus allowing continuation of metabolism via the naphthalene pathway."
2982,4
2983,"Anthracene is similarly metabolized, through 1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxyanthracene to 1,2-dihydroxyanthracene, in which ring-fission occurs to give cis-4-(2-hydroxynaphth-3-yl)-2-oxobut-3-enoic acid."
2984,The position of cleavage is again at the bond between the angular C and C-1 of the anthracene nucleus.
2985,5
2986,Enzymes that convert the fission product through 2-hydroxy-3-naphthaldehyde into 2-hydroxy-3-naphthoic acid were demonstrated.

2989,"The Fe(2+)-dependent oxygenase responsible for cleavage of all the o-dihydroxyphenol derivatives appears to be catechol 2,3-oxygenase, and is a constitutive enzyme in the Pseudomonas strains used.Malonate semialdehyde decarboxylase (MSAD) has been identified as the protein encoded by the orf130 gene from Pseudomonas pavonaceae 170 on the basis of the genomic context of the gene as well as its ability to catalyze the decarboxylation of malonate semialdehyde to generate acetaldehyde."
2990,"The enzyme is found in a degradative pathway for the xenobiotic nematocide trans-1,3-dichloropropene."
2991,"MSAD has no sequence homology to previously characterized decarboxylases, but the presence of a conserved motif (Pro1-(X)8 -Gly-Arg11-X-Asp-X-Gln) in its N-terminal region suggested a relationship to the tautomerase superfamily."
2992,Sequence analysis identified Pro1 and Arg75 as potential active site residues that might be involved in the MSAD activity.
2993,The results of site-directed mutagenesis experiments confirmed the importance of these residues to activity and provided further evidence to implicate MSAD as a new member of the tautomerase superfamily.
2994,MSAD is the first identified decarboxylase in the superfamily and is possibly the first characterized member of a new and distinct family within this superfamily.
2995,"Malonate semialdehyde is analogous to a beta-keto acid, and enzymes that catalyze the decarboxylation of these acids generally utilize metal ion catalysis, a Schiff base intermediate, or polarization of the carbonyl group by hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic interactions."
2996,A mechanistic analysis shows that the rate of the reaction is not affected by the presence of a metal ion or EDTA while the incubation of MSAD with the substrate in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride results in the irreversible inactivation of the enzyme.
2997,The site of modification is Pro1.
2998,"These observations are consistent with the latter two mechanisms, but do not exclude the first mechanism."
2999,"Based on the sequence analysis, the outcome of the mutagenesis and mechanistic experiments, and the roles determined for Pro1 and the conserved arginine in all tautomerase superfamily members characterized thus far, two mechanistic scenarios are proposed for the MSAD-catalyzed reaction in which Pro1 and Arg75 play prominent roles.Four slime-producing uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains were used to investigate the activity of fosfomycin and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against biofilms developed on 96-well polystyrene tissue culture plates."
3000,"Biofilms aged, respectively, 5 (initial) and 48 h (mature) and two fosfomycin concentrations (128 and 2000 mg/l) were used."
3001,The effect of various levels (0.007-8 mg/ml) of NAC alone and in combination with fosfomycin on the formation or disruption of biofilms was assessed.
3002,"Following exposure to the drugs, the percentage of residual slime relative to the control, ranged from 62.5-100 to 26.2-64.1% in the presence of 0.007 and 8 mg/ml of NAC."
3003,"After treatment of pre-formed biofilms with NAC at the highest concentrations used, the remaining exopolysaccharide matrix was reduced to 25-68% of the amount found with the untreated control."
3004,"Exposure to fosfomycin at 2000 mg/l reduced biofilms 40-57 and 41-49% for the initial and mature forms, respectively."
3005,Fosfomycin was more active at 2000 mg/l combined with NAC 2 mg/ml.
3006,"Under these conditions initial and mature biofilms were reduced 66-80 and 60-73%, respectively."
3007,"NAC, when used in combination, enhanced fosfomycin bactericidal activity producing a 99-99.9% reduction in viable cells."
3008,Fosfomycin and NAC at concentrations achievable in urine displayed a synergistic effect promoting both the formation of biofilms and reduction of sessile cell viability.A new bacterium that grows aerobically on cyclohexane was isolated from the wastewater plant of a petroleum refinery.
3009,This strain grows on a range of light hydrocarbons (C5-C10) as well as on some aromatic compounds such as toluene and m-cresol.
3010,Growth on hydrocarbons requires the presence of yeast extract and other complex media components that are not substrates for growth themselves.
3011,Strain CHX is resistant to cyclohexane and grows at concentrations up to 2 g l(-1).
3012,Strain CHX branches deeply within the Comamonadeae family of beta-proteobacteria and is tentatively assigned to the Brachymonas genus as Brachymonas petroleovorans CHX.Compound-specific stable isotope analysis (CSIA) using gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/IRMS) has developed into a mature analytical method in many application areas over the last decade.
3013,"This is in particular true for carbon isotope analysis, whereas measurements of the other elements amenable to CSIA (hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen) are much less routine."
3014,"In environmental sciences, successful applications to date include (i) the allocation of contaminant sources on a local, regional, and global scale, (ii) the identification and quantification of (bio)transformation reactions on scales ranging from batch experiments to contaminated field sites, and (iii) the characterization of elementary reaction mechanisms that govern product formation."
3015,These three application areas are discussed in detail.
3016,"The investigated spectrum of compounds comprises mainly n-alkanes, monoaromatics such as benzene and toluene, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and chlorinated hydrocarbons such as tetrachloromethane, trichloroethylene, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)."
3017,Future research directions are primarily set by the state of the art in analytical instrumentation and method development.
3018,"Approaches to utilize HPLC separation in CSIA, the enhancement of sensitivity of CSIA to allow field investigations in the microg L(-1) range, and the development of methods for CSIA of other elements are reviewed."
3019,"Furthermore, an alternative scheme to evaluate isotope data is outlined that would enable estimates of position-specific kinetic isotope effects and, thus, allow one to extract mechanistic chemical and biochemical information.Tetrabromobisphenol-A is a reactive flame retardant used in the production of many plastic polymers."
3020,"In previous research, it was demonstrated that anaerobic microorganisms from contaminated sediment debrominate tetrabromobisphenol-A to bisphenol-A, but an enrichment culture was not established."
3021,The current study was carried out to identify the intermediate metabolites in this process and to determine the factors facilitating enrichment of debrominating microorganisms.
3022,"During the enrichment process in an anaerobic semi-continuous batch reactor, tetrabromobisphenol-A debromination gradually slowed down with concurrent accumulation of three intermediate products."
3023,"These compounds were tentatively identified using GC-MS as tri-, di-, and mono-brominated bisphenol-A."
3024,"GC-MS and HPLC analyses showed one dominant metabolite of dibromobisphenol-A, and NMR analysis identified it as 2,2\'-dibromobisphenol-A."
3025,Addition of sterile sediment (15% wt/wt) to the reactor stimulated debromination of tetrabromobisphenol-A.
3026,"Furthermore, different solid amendments such as surface soil and pulverized gray chalk from the site subsurface (100 m below ground) were also stimulating agents."
3027,"We conclude that organic matter is involved in stimulation since the stimulation effect of the sediment, soil and gray chalk was abolished after it was heat-treated to 550 degrees C. Our study suggests that the debrominating culture requires some organic components found in the sediment, soil, and chalk in order to sustain activity and perhaps to survive."
3028,"The possible mechanisms of stimulation by these solids are discussed.Microbial resistance to the antibiotic fosfomycin  is known to be mediated by thiol transferase enzymes FosA and FosB, which catalyze the addition of glutathione and l-cysteine to C1 of the oxirane, respectively."
3029,A probe of the microbial genome database reveals a related group of enzymes (FosX).
3030,The genes mlr3345 from Mesorhizobium loti and lmo1702 from Listeria monocytogenes were cloned and the proteins expressed.
3031,This heretofore unrecognized group of enzymes is shown to catalyze the Mn(II)-dependent addition of water to C1 of the oxirane.
3032,"The ability of each enzyme to confer resistance in Escherichia coli is correlated with their catalytic efficiency, such that the M. loti protein confers low resistance while the Listeria enzyme confers very robust resistance."
3033,The crystal structure of the FosX from M. loti was solved at a resolution of 1.83 A.
3034,The structure reveals an active-site carboxylate (E44) located about 5 A from the expected position of the substrate that appears to be poised to participate in catalysis.
3035,Single turnover experiments in H218O and kinetic analysis of the E44G mutant of the FosX enzymes indicate that the carboxylate of E44 acts as a general base in the direct addition of water to 1.
3036,The FosX from M. loti also catalyzes the addition of glutathione to the antibiotic.
3037,"The catalytic promiscuity and low efficiency of the M. loti protein suggest that it may be an intermediate in the evolution of clinically relevant fosfomycin resistance proteins such as the FosX from Listeria monocytogenese.We have earlier reported a novel reductive pathway for o-nitrobenzoate (ONB) degradation (at 0.5 mM) in Arthrobacter protophormiae RKJ100, which proceeds via the formation of o-hydroxylaminobenzoate (HABA) and anthranilate (AA)."
3038,"During growth of this organism at 40 times higher concentration (20 mM) of ONB, 3-hydroxyanthranilate (HAA) was identified as an intermediate by thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography studies."
3039,"Crude cell extracts of ONB-grown cells showed HAA 3,4-dioxygenase activity suggesting HAA as a terminal aromatic intermediate of the catabolic energy-yielding pathway as shown before in Pseudomonas fluorescens strain KU-7."
3040,"HAA is further cleaved to 2-amino-3-carboxymuconic-6-semialdehyde by the action of HAA 3,4-dioxygenase."
3041,"In this report we propose that ONB degradation occurs via the formation of HABA and the pathway branches at this point to form the two different aromatic intermediates AA and HAA by the action of a reductase and a mutase, respectively.The level of expression of highly conserved, plasmid-borne, and widely dispersed atrazine catabolic genes (atz) was studied by RT-qPCR in two telluric atrazine-degrading microbes."

3045,In Pseudomonas sp.
3046,"ADP, atz genes were basally expressed."
3047,It confirmed atrazine-degrading kinetics indicating that catabolic activity starts immediately after adding the herbicide.
3048,atz gene expression increased transitorily in response to atrazine treatment.
3049,This increase was only observed while low amount of atrazine remained in the medium.
3050,"In C. heintzii, only atzA was basally expressed."
3051,atzA and atzB expression levels were similarly and significantly increased in response to atrazine treatment.
3052,atzC was not expressed even in the presence of high amounts of atrazine.
3053,This study showed that atz genes are basally expressed and up-regulated in response to atrazine treatment.
3054,"atz gene expression patterns are different in Pseudomonas ADP and C. heintzii suggesting that the host may influence the expression of plasmid-borne atrazine-catabolic potential.A new strain isolated from soil utilizes cyclopropanecarboxylate as the sole source of carbon and energy and was identified as Rhodococcus rhodochrous (H.

3056,"80:400-402, 1995)."
3057,"A novel pathway for the utilization of cyclopropanecarboxylate, a highly strained compound, by this bacterium was investigated."
3058,Cyclopropanecarboxylate-dependent reduction of NAD(+) in cell extracts of cyclopropanecarboxylate-grown cells was observed.
3059,"When intermediates accumulated in vitro in the absence of NAD(+) were trapped as hydroxamic acids by reaction with hydroxylamine, cyclopropanecarboxohydroxamic acid and 3-hydroxybutyrohydroxamic acid were formed."
3060,"Cyclopropanecarboxyl-coenzyme A (CoA), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, and crotonyl-CoA were oxidized with NAD(+) in cell extracts, whereas methacrylyl-CoA and 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA were not."
3061,"When both CoA and ATP were added, organic acids corresponding to the former three CoA thioesters were also oxidized in vitro by NAD(+), while methacrylate, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate, and 2-hydroxybutyrate were not."
3062,"Therefore, it was concluded that cyclopropanecarboxylate undergoes oxidative degradation through cyclopropanecarboxyl-CoA and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA."
3063,"The enzymes catalyzing formation and ring opening of cyclopropanecarboxyl-CoA were shown to be inducible, while other enzymes involved in the degradation were constitutive.Metabolism of the environmental pollutant benzopyrene in the bacterium Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 was examined."
3064,"This organism initially oxidized benzopyrene with dioxygenases and monooxygenases at C-4,5, C-9,10, and C-11,12."
3065,"The metabolites were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and characterized by UV-visible, mass, nuclear magnetic resonance, and circular dichroism spectral analyses."
3066,"The major intermediates of benzopyrene metabolism that had accumulated in the culture media after 96 h of incubation were cis-4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxybenzopyrene (benzopyrene cis-4,5-dihydrodiol), cis-11,12-dihydro-11,12-dihydroxybenzopyrene (benzopyrene cis-11,12-dihydrodiol), trans-11,12-dihydro-11,12-dihydroxybenzopyrene (benzopyrene trans-11,12-dihydrodiol), 10-oxabenzochrysen-9-one, and hydroxymethoxy and dimethoxy derivatives of benzopyrene."
3067,"The ortho-ring fission products 4-formylchrysene-5-carboxylic acid and 4,5-chrysene-dicarboxylic acid and a monocarboxylated chrysene product were formed when replacement culture experiments were conducted with benzopyrene cis-4,5-dihydrodiol."
3068,"Chiral stationary-phase HPLC analysis of the dihydrodiols indicated that benzopyrene cis-4,5-dihydrodiol had 30% 4S,5R and 70% 4R,5S absolute stereochemistry."
3069,"Benzopyrene cis-11,12-dihydrodiol adopted an 11S,12R conformation with 100% optical purity."
3070,"The enantiomeric composition of benzopyrene trans-11,12-dihydrodiol was an equal mixture of 11S,12S and 11R,12R molecules."
3071,"The results of this study, in conjunction with those of previously reported studies, extend the pathways proposed for the bacterial metabolism of benzopyrene."
3072,Our study also provides evidence of the stereo- and regioselectivity of the oxygenases that catalyze the metabolism of benzopyrene in M. vanbaalenii PYR-1.Streptomycetes resistant to the herbicide alachlor  were used in degradation assays to characterize the products of alachlor biodegradation.
3073,"Of six strains tested, Streptomyces sp."
3074,"LS166, LS177, and LS182 were able to grow at an alachlor concentration of 144 mg l(-1) and degraded approximately 60-75% of the alachlor in 14 days, as evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography."
3075,The alachlor biodegradation products were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based on mass spectral data and fragmentation patterns.
3076,"All compounds detected in these assays were similar for all streptomycetes strains tested, and involved dechlorination with subsequent N-dealkylation and cyclization of the remaining N-substituent with one of the ethyl groups to produce indole and quinoline derivatives."
3077,The enzymatic pathway used by Streptomyces sp.
3078,"LS182 did not generate DEA (2\',6\'-diethylaniline), a carcinogenic derivative of alachlor reported in other studies."
3079,"Given the high degradation rates observed here, the Streptomyces strains tested may be useful in the degradation/detoxification processes of alachlor.Initial denitration of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) by Rhodococcus sp."

3082,"A soil sample taken from an ammunition plant contained RDX (342 micromol kg(-1)), HMX (octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine; 3,057 micromol kg(-1)), MNX (hexahydro-1-nitroso-3,5-dinitro-1,3,5-triazine; 155 micromol kg(-1)), and traces of NDAB (3.8 micromol kg(-1))."
3083,The detection of the last in real soil provided the first experimental evidence for the occurrence of natural attenuation that involved ring cleavage of RDX.
3084,"When we incubated the soil with strain DN22, both RDX and MNX (but not HMX) degraded and produced NDAB (388 +/- 22 micromol kg(-1)) in 5 days."
3085,"Subsequent incubation of the soil with the fungus led to the removal of NDAB, with the liberation of nitrous oxide (N2O)."
3086,In cultures with the fungus alone NDAB degraded to give a stoichiometric amount of N2O.
3087,"To determine C stoichiometry, we first generated NDAB in situ by incubating RDX with strain DN22, followed by incubation with the fungus."
3088,The production of 14CO2 increased from 30 (DN22 only) to 76% (fungus).
3089,Experiments with pure enzymes revealed that manganese-dependent peroxidase rather than lignin peroxidase was responsible for NDAB degradation.
3090,"The detection of NDAB in contaminated soil and its effective mineralization by the fungus P. chrysosporium may constitute the basis for the development of bioremediation technologies.A study was conducted to determine the serotypes, the coverage of the heptavalent conjugate vaccine (VCN 7-v) and the antibiotic susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae in children (<15 years) in the health districts of the provinces of Castellon and Valencia, Spain, from June 1999 to December 2002."
3091,"A total of 271 strains were evaluated, 15.5% of which were invasive, 63.5% were of respiratory origin and 22.5% were from conjunctival and otitic exudates; 67.2% of the strains were found in children younger than 2 years of age."
3092,"The distribution of the serotypes showed slight changes according to age and the origin of the sample: the most common serotypes were 19, 6, 23, 14, 3, 9 and 11; however, in children younger than 2 years of age the order changed to 19, 6, 14 and 23, 9, 11 and 3, and in the invasive strains to 19, 6, 14, 3 and 23."
3093,A total of 27.2% of the stains were susceptible to the ten antibiotics tested.
3094,"For penicillin, reduced susceptibility was found in 50.4% and high resistance in 5.8%; 98.3% were susceptible to ampicillin and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and 80.7% to cefuroxime; 52.5% were resistant to erythromycin and 43.7% to clindamycin."
3095,"No strains were resistant to rifampicin, vancomycin, levofloxacin or cefotaxime."
3096,"The most susceptible serotypes were 3 and 11, and the most resistant was 14 (which consistently showed resistance to an antibiotic), 19, 6 and 23."
3097,"According to these data, the theoretical coverage of VCN 7-v would be 80.1% in children younger than 2 years and 73.43% in those aged 0-14 years.Caffeine has been found in tissues of several plants."
3098,"Because of its stimulating effect on the central nervous system, a great number of reports have been published on its content in beverages and foodstuffs."
3099,"However, a much more restricted number of reports have dealt specifically with caffeine metabolism in plants."
3100,"This review presents, in chronological manner, the contribution of these reports to the vast knowledge accumulated on caffeine catabolism in plants and microorganisms over the last 40 years."
3101,"In plants, the accumulated data indicate the operation of a main catabolic pathway: caffeine --> theophylline --> 3-methylxantine --> xanthine --> uric acid --> allantoin --> allantoic acid --> glyoxylic acid + urea --> NH3 + CO2."
3102,"Some studies have shown that, depending on the plant species, other minor routes may operate with the formation of theobromine and 7-methylxantine, which are salvaged for caffeine formation since they also appear in the biosynthetic pathway."
3103,"A specific group of coffee known as liberio-excelsioides has the ability to convert caffeine to the corresponding methyluric acid, which is methylated to other uric acid derivatives."
3104,In bacteria caffeine is either degraded to theobromine or paraxanthine.
3105,Both dimethylxanthines are demethylated to 7-methylxantine which in turn is demethylated to xanthine and then enters the catabolic pathway of purines.
3106,"In bacteria, theobromine, paraxanthine and 7-methylxantine may also be oxidized to their corresponding methyluric acids.Microorganisms capable of degrading carbofuran were isolated from soils and examined for the degradation of this pesticide at ring structure."
3107,An isolate that could degrade carbofuran and carbofuran-7-phenol was selected for further studies.
3108,"The 16S rRNA analysis results showed that the isolate belongs to the genus of Sphingomonas, close to dioxin and dicamba degraders, and is named Sphingomonas sp."
3109,SB5.
3110,SB5 did not show any similarity of 16S rRNA to known carbofuran degraders.
3111,"When time-course degradation of carbofuran by SB5 was examined by solvent extraction combined with liquid chromatographic analysis, almost complete disappearance of carbofuran was observed within 12 h, giving several accumulative metabolites."
3112,Bacterial cultures incubated with carbofuran-7-phenol suggested that the accumulated metabolites were derived from carbofuran-7-phenol.
3113,"The control without SB5 and kanamycin-treated SB5 did not show any metabolite, suggesting a biological involvement in the degradation of carbofuran."
3114,"GC/MS and LC/MS analyses identified 2-hydroxy-3-(3-methylpropan-2-ol) phenol as one of the accumulated metabolites, suggesting that the strain SB5 could degrade carbofuran-7-phenol by hydrolysis at the furanyl ring."
3115,This is the first report to identify 2-hydroxy-3-(3-methylpropan-2-ol) phenol as a new product derived biologically from carbofuran-7-phenol.Biodegradation of 14C-labelled nonylphenol at the concentration 11 microg litre (-1) in seawater has been estimated by collection and quantification of the formed labelled carbon dioxide.
3116,"Initially degradation was very slow but when the microorganisms had become adapted, after four weeks at 11 degrees C, the degradation rate increased rapidly and after 58 days about 50% of 14C from NP was found in the CO2 fraction."
3117,In the presence of sediment the initial degradation rate was high and did not increase after longer incubation.
3118,Lack of oxygen reduced the degradation rate by half in the presence of sediment.Anammox bacteria belong to the phylum Planctomycetes and perform anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox); they oxidize ammonium with nitrite as the electron acceptor to yield dinitrogen gas.
3119,The anammox reaction takes place inside the anammoxosome: an intracytoplasmic compartment bounded by a single ladderane lipid-containing membrane.
3120,"The anammox bacteria, first found in a wastewater treatment plant in The Netherlands, have the potential to remove ammonium from wastewater without the addition of organic carbon."
3121,Very recently anammox bacteria were also discovered in the Black Sea where they are responsible for 30-50% of the nitrogen consumption.
3122,"This review will introduce different forms of intracytoplasmic membrane systems found in prokaryotes and discuss the compartmentalization in anammox bacteria and its possible functional relation to catabolism and energy transduction.The anhydrofructose pathway describes the degradation of glycogen and starch to metabolites via 1,5-anhydro-d-fructose (1,5AnFru)."
3123,"The enzyme catalyzing the first reaction step of this pathway, i.e., alpha-1,4-glucan lyase (EC 4.2.1.13), has been purified, cloned and characterized from fungi and red algae in our laboratory earlier."
3124,"In the present study, two 1,5AnFru metabolizing enzymes were discovered in the fungus Anthracobia melaloma for the formation of ascopyrone P (APP), a fungal secondary metabolite exhibiting antibacterial and antioxidant activity."
3125,"These are 1,5AnFru dehydratase (AFDH) and ascopyrone tautomerase (APTM)."
3126,"AFDH catalyzed the conversion of 1,5AnFru to ascopyrone M (APM), a compound that has been earlier presumed to occur biologically, while APTM isomerized the APM formed to APP."
3127,"Both enzymes were purified 400-fold by (NH(4))(2)SO(4) fractionation, hydrophobic interaction, ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography."
3128,The purified AFDH showed a molecular mass of 98 kDa on SDS-PAGE and 230 kDa by gel filtration.
3129,The corresponding values for APTM was 60 and 140 kDa.
3130,Spectrophotometric and HPLC methods were developed for the assay of these two enzymes.
3131,"To confirm that A. melaloma possessed all enzymes needed for conversion of glycogen to APP, an alpha-1,4-glucan lyase from this fungus was isolated and partially sequenced."
3132,"Based on this work, a scheme of the enzymatic description of the anhydrofructose pathway in A. melaloma was proposed.Two hydrogenation reactions in the initial steps of degradation of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol produce the dihydride Meisenheimer complex of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol."
3133,"The npdH gene (contained in the npd gene cluster of the 2,4,6-trinitrophenol-degrading strain Rhodococcus opacus HL PM-1) was shown here to encode a tautomerase, catalyzing a proton shift between the aci-nitro and the nitro forms of the dihydride Meisenheimer complex of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol."
3134,"An enzyme (which eliminated nitrite from the aci-nitro form but not the nitro form of the dihydride complex of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol) was purified from the 2,4,6-trinitrophenol-degrading strain Nocardioides simplex FJ2-1A."
3135,"The product of nitrite release was the hydride Meisenheimer complex of 2,4-dinitrophenol, which was hydrogenated to the dihydride Meisenheimer complex of 2,4-dinitrophenol by the hydride transferase I and the NADPH-dependent F(420) reductase from strain HL PM-1."
3136,"At pH 7.5, the dihydride complex of 2,4-dinitrophenol is protonated to 2,4-dinitrocyclohexanone."
3137,"A hydrolase was purified from strain FJ2-1A and shown to cleave 2,4-dinitrocyclohexanone hydrolytically to 4,6-dinitrohexanoate.There is an urgent need to understand the mechanism of activation of the frontline anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase."
3138,"To address this, a combination of NMR spectroscopic, biochemical, and computational methods have been used to obtain a model of the frontline anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid bound to the active site of the class III peroxidase, horseradish peroxidase C. This information has been used in combination with the new crystal structure of the M. tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase to predict the mode of INH binding across the class I heme peroxidase family."
3139,"An enzyme-catalyzed mechanism for INH activation is proposed that brings together structural, functional, and spectroscopic data from a variety of sources."
3140,"Collectively, the information not only provides a molecular basis for understanding INH activation by the M. tuberculosis catalase-peroxidase but also establishes a new conceptual framework for testing hypotheses regarding the enzyme-catalyzed turnover of this compound in a number of heme peroxidases.Parvibaculum lavamentivorans DS-1(T) utilized the commercial surfactant linear alkylbenzenesulfonate (LAS) (20 congeners with C(10) to C(13) side chains) as a carbon and energy source by shortening the side chain, and sulfophenylcarboxylates (SPCs) and similar compounds (e.g., alpha,beta-unsaturated SPCs ) were excreted with quantitative recovery of the sulfophenyl moiety."
3141,"2-(4-Sulfophenyl)decane (2-C10-LAS) was converted largely to 3-(4-sulfophenyl)butyrate (3-C4-SPC), as were 2-C12-LAS and 2-C14-LAS; the other products were 5-C6-SPC (SPC+2C) and 3-C4-SPC-2H."
3142,"2-C11-LAS was converted largely to 4-C5-SPC with the corresponding SPC+2C and SPC-2H; similarly, 3-C12-LAS yielded 4-C6-SPC with the corresponding SPC+2C and SPC-2H."
3143,This pattern of products confirmed that LAS is degraded by omega-oxygenation and chain shortening through beta-oxidation.
3144,At least nine major SPCs were formed from commercial LAS.
3145,The novel isolates Comamonas testosteroni SPB-2 and KF-1 utilized 3-C4-SPC; Delftia acidovorans SPH-1 utilized 4-C6-SPC enantioselectively.
3146,The substrate-dependent oxygen uptake of whole cells of strain SPB-2 indicated that there was inducible oxygenation of 3-C4-SPC and of 4-sulfophenol in whole cells of the strains of C. testosteroni during growth with 3-C4-SPC or 4-sulfophenol.
3147,"The degradative pathways apparently involved 4-sulfocatechol and 4-sulfocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase."
3148,"Strain SPB-2 and strain DS-1(T) grew together in LAS-salts medium, and only seven of the nine major SPCs were recovered."
3149,"Strain SPB-2 utilized 3-C4-SPC, 3-C5-SPC, and 3-C4-SPC-2H."
3150,"Strain SPH-1 grew together with strain DS-1(T) in LAS-salts medium, and a different set of seven major SPCs was recovered."
3151,"Strain SPH-1 utilized 4-C6-SPC, 4-C5-SPC, 4-C6-SPC-2H, and 4-C5-SPC-2H."
3152,"A three-member community consisting of strains DS-1(T), SPB-2, and SPH-1 utilized four major SPCs."
3153,"We inferred that this community mineralized the major SPCs derived from 8 of the 20 LAS congeners.Arthrobacter aurescens strain TC1 metabolizes atrazine to cyanuric acid via TrzN, AtzB, and AtzC."
3154,"The complete sequence of a 160-kb bacterial artificial chromosome clone indicated that trzN, atzB, and atzC are linked on the A. aurescens genome."
3155,"TrzN, AtzB, and AtzC were shown to be functional in Escherichia coli."
3156,"Hybridization studies localized trzN, atzB, and atzC to a 380-kb plasmid in A. aurescens strain TC1.Isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) is a frontline antituberculosis agent."
3157,"Once taken up by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, INH requires activation by the catalase-peroxidase KatG, converting INH from its prodrug form into a range of bactericidal reactive species."
3158,Here we used 15N-labeled INH together with electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping techniques to demonstrate that nitric oxide (NO*) is generated from oxidation at the hydrazide nitrogens during the activation of INH by M. tuberculosis KatG.
3159,We also observed that a specific scavenger of NO* provided protection against the antimycobacterial activity of INH in bacterial culture.
3160,"No significant increases in mycobacterial protein nitration were detected, suggesting that NOdot; and not peroxynitrite, a nitrating metabolite of NO*, is involved in antimycobacterial action."
3161,"In conclusion, INH-derived NO* has biological activity, which directly contributes to the antimycobacterial action of INH.Isooctane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane), a major component of gasoline formulations, is recalcitrant to biodegradation probably because of the quaternary carbon group it contains."
3162,Information on the biodegradability of this hydrocarbon is essential to evaluate its fate in the environment.
3163,"For these reasons, the degradation kinetics and the catabolic pathway of isooctane were investigated in Mycobacterium austroafricanum IFP 2173, the only strain characterized to use it as sole carbon and energy source.The last step of the biosynthesis of fosfomycin is the conversion of (S)-2-hydroxypropylphosphonic acid (HPP) to fosfomycin by HPP epoxidase (HppE), which is a mononuclear non-heme iron-dependent enzyme."
3164,"The apo-HppE from Streptomyces wedmorensis is colorless, but turns green with broad absorption bands at 430 and 680 nm after reconstitution with ferrous ion under aerobic conditions."
3165,"Resonance Raman studies showed that this green chromophore arises from a bidentate iron(III)-catecholate (DOPA) complex, and the most likely site of modification is at Tyr105 on the basis of site-specific mutagenesis results."
3166,It was also found that reconstitution in the presence of ascorbate leads to the formation of additional DOPA that shows (18)O-incorporation from (18)O(2).
3167,"Thus, HppE can act as an oxygenase via a putative high valent iron-oxo or an iron-hydroperoxo intermediate, just like other members of the family of non-heme iron enzymes."
3168,"The oxygen activation mechanism for catalytic turnover is proposed to parallel that for self-hydroxylation.Increasing pollution of water and soils by xenobiotic compounds has led in the last few decades to an acute need for understanding the impact of toxic compounds on microbial populations, the catabolic degradation pathways of xenobiotics and the set-up and improvement of bioremediation processes."
3169,"Recent advances in molecular techniques, including high-throughput approaches such as microarrays and metagenomics, have opened up new perspectives and pointed towards new opportunities in pollution abatement and environmental management."
3170,"Compared with traditional molecular techniques dependent on the isolation of pure cultures in the laboratory, microarrays and metagenomics allow specific environmental questions to be answered by exploring and using the phenomenal resources of uncultivable and uncharacterized micro-organisms."
3171,"This paper reviews the current potential of microarrays and metagenomics to investigate the genetic diversity of environmentally relevant micro-organisms and identify new functional genes involved in the catabolism of xenobiotics.While several microorganisms readily degrade 2- and 4-fluorobenzoates, only a very small number appear to catabolise the 3-fluoro isomer, owing to the accumulation of toxic intermediates."
3172,"Here we describe the isolation of a bacterium capable of using 3-fluorobenzoate as a sole source of carbon and energy, and the experiments conducted to define the steps involved in the biodegradation of this compound."
3173,The organism was identified as a strain belonging to the genus Sphingomonas by sequence analysis of its 16S rRNA gene.
3174,To date no other organism from this genus is known to degrade this compound.
3175,Using fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (19F NMR) to analyse the culture supernatant it was possible to observe the disappearance of 3-fluorobenzoate and the appearance of fluoride ion and four other fluorinated compounds.
3176,"These were identified as 3-fluorocatechol, 2-fluoromuconic acid and 3- and 5-fluoro-1,2-dihydro-1,2-dihydroxybenzoates."
3177,"Thus, the likely catabolic pathway involves dioxygenation of 3-fluorobenzoate yielding fluorocatechol and subsequent intra-diol cleavage to yield fluoromuconic acid."
3178,The organism can also use 2- and 4-fluorobenzoates as growth substrates.Siderophores are extracellular iron-binding compounds that mediate iron transport into many cells.
3179,"We present evidence of analogous molecules for copper transport from methane-oxidizing bacteria, represented here by a small fluorescent chromopeptide (C45N12O14H62Cu, 1216 daltons) produced by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b."
3180,"The crystal structure of this compound, methanobactin, was resolved to 1.15 angstroms."
3181,"It is composed of a tetrapeptide, a tripeptide, and several unusual moieties, including two 4-thionyl-5-hydroxy-imidazole chromophores that coordinate the copper, a pyrrolidine that confers a bend in the overall chain, and an amino-terminal isopropylester group."
3182,The copper coordination environment includes a dual nitrogen- and sulfur-donating system derived from the thionyl imidazolate moieties.
3183,"Structural elucidation of this molecule has broad implications in terms of organo-copper chemistry, biological methane oxidation, and global carbon cycling.Biodegradation of crude oil in subsurface petroleum reservoirs is an important alteration process with major economic consequences."
3184,Aerobic degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons at the surface is well documented and it has long been thought that the flow of oxygen- and nutrient-bearing meteoric waters into reservoirs was necessary for in-reservoir petroleum biodegradation.
3185,"The occurrence of biodegraded oils in reservoirs where aerobic conditions are unlikely, together with the identification of several anaerobic microorganisms in oil fields and the discovery of anaerobic hydrocarbon biodegradation mechanisms, suggests that anaerobic degradation processes could also be responsible."
3186,"The extent of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation processes in the world\'s deep petroleum reservoirs, however, remains strongly contested."
3187,"Moreover, no organism has yet been isolated that has been shown to degrade hydrocarbons under the conditions found in deep petroleum reservoirs."
3188,"Here we report the isolation of metabolites indicative of anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation from a large fraction of 77 degraded oil samples from both marine and lacustrine sources from around the world, including the volumetrically important Canadian tar sands."
3189,"Our results therefore suggest that anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation is a common process in biodegraded subsurface oil reservoirs.The gene for NAT (arylamine N-acetyltransferase) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (panat) has been cloned from genomic DNA, and the gene product (PANAT) expressed as an N-terminal histidine-tagged protein in Escherichia coli and purified via nickel ion affinity chromatography."
3190,The specific activities of PANAT against a broad range of substrates have been investigated and compared with those of other prokaryotic NAT enzymes.
3191,"For most arylamine substrates identified, PANAT exhibits in vitro specific activities typically one order of magnitude greater than those of recombinant NAT enzymes from Mycobacterium smegmatis or Salmonella typhimurium."
3192,"Among the substrates of PANAT so far identified are the anti-tubercular drug isoniazid, 5-aminosalicylate (a drug used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease), as well as important environmental pollutants such as 3,4-dichloroaniline and 2-aminofluorene."
3193,"As well as acetylating common NAT substrates, PANAT is unique among the prokaryotic NATs so far studied in acetylating the folate precursor 4-aminobenzoic acid and the folate catabolite 4-aminobenzoylglutamate."
3194,"The recombinant protein has been expressed in sufficient quantity to allow protein crystallization, and we have subsequently determined the 1.95 A structure of PANAT by X-ray crystallography.2-Mercaptobenzothiazole, which is mainly used in the rubber industry as a vulcanization accelerator, is very toxic and is considered to be recalcitrant."
3195,We show here for the first time that it can be biotransformed and partially mineralized by a pure-culture bacterial strain of Rhodococcus rhodochrous.
3196,"Three metabolites, among four detected, were identified.Following biodegradation tests according to the OECD guidelines for testing of chemicals 301F different degradation rates were observed for the three stereoisomers of iminodisuccinate (IDS)."
3197,"A strain was isolated from activated sludge, which used two of three isomers, R,S-IDS and S,S-IDS, as sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy."
3198,The isolated strain was identified by 16S-rDNA and referred to as Ralstonia sp.
3199,SLRS7.
3200,An IDS-degrading lyase was isolated from the cell-free extract.
3201,"The enzyme was purified by three chromatographic steps, which included anion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and gel filtration."
3202,The lyase catalysed the non-hydrolytic cleavage of IDS without requirement of any cofactors.
3203,"Cleavage of S,S-IDS led to the formation of fumaric acid and L-aspartic acid."
3204,"Interestingly R,S-IDS yielded only D-aspartic acid besides fumaric acid."
3205,"R,R-IDS was not transformed."
3206,"Thus, the IDS-degrading enzyme is a carbon-nitrogen lyase attacking only the asymmetric carbon atom exhibiting the S-configuration."
3207,"Besides S,S-IDS and R,S-IDS cleavage, the lyase catalysed also the transformation of certain S,S-IDS metal complexes, namely Ca(2+)-, Mg(2+)- and Mn(2+)-IDS."
3208,The maximum enzyme activity was found at pH 8.0-8.5 and 35 degrees C. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed a single 57-kDa protein band.
3209,"The native enzyme was estimated to be around 240 kDa indicating a homotetramer enzyme.Steroid degradation genes of Comamonas testosteroni TA441 are encoded in at least two gene clusters: one containing the meta-cleavage enzyme gene tesB and ORF1, 2, 3; and another consisting of ORF18, 17, tesI, H, A2, and tesA1, D, E, F, G (tesA2 to ORF18 and tesA1 to tesG are encoded in opposite directions)."
3210,"Analysis of transposon mutants with low steroid degradation revealed 13 ORFs and a gene (ORF4, 5, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, and tesR) involved in steroid degradation in the downstream region of ORF3."
3211,"TesR, which is almost identical to that of TeiR, a positive regulator of Delta1-dehydrogenase (corresponds to TesH in TA441) and 3alpha-dehydrogenase (currently not identified in TA441), in C. testosteroni ATCC11996 (Pruneda-Paz, 2004), was shown to be necessary for induction of the steroid degradation gene clusters identified in TA441, tesB to tesR, tesA1 to tesG, and tesA2 to ORF18."
3212,"At least some of the ORFs from ORF3 to ORF33 were suggested to be involved in 9,17-dioxo-1,2,3,4,10,19-hexanorandrostan-5-oic acid degradation.The upper pathway of anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene was studied with a sulphate-reducing enrichment culture, which is able to grow with naphthalene or 2-methylnaphthalene as sole carbon source and electron donor."
3213,"Anaerobic degradation of 2-methylnaphthalene is initiated by an addition of fumarate to the methyl-group producing the first intermediate, naphthyl-2-methyl-succinate."
3214,"In a subsequent beta-oxidation of the original methyl atom, the central metabolite 2-naphthoic acid is generated."
3215,"In the following pathway, the aromatic ring system is reduced, cleaved, and finally oxidised to CO(2)."
3216,"Here, we present two new enzymatic reactions of the 2-methylnaphthalene degradation pathway that were measured in crude cell extracts."
3217,All metabolites were identified with HPLC by co-elution with synthesised reference substances.
3218,"The first enzyme, succinyl-CoA:naphthyl-2-methyl-succinate CoA-transferase, catalyses the activation of naphthyl-2-methyl-succinic acid to the corresponding CoA ester."
3219,The average specific activity of this enzyme was 19.6 nmol x min(-1) x mg of protein(-1).
3220,"The CoA-transfer was not inhibited by sodium borohydride and only partially by hydroxylamine, indicating that this enzyme belongs to the family III of CoA-transferases like the corresponding enzyme in the anaerobic toluene degradation pathway."
3221,"The product of this CoA-transfer reaction, naphthyl-2-methyl-succinyl-CoA is then oxidised in a reaction to naphthyl-2-methylene-succinyl-CoA by the enzyme naphthyl-2-methyl-succinyl-CoA dehydrogenase."
3222,The specific activity of this enzyme was 0.115 nmol x min(-1) x mg of protein(-1).
3223,The enzymatic activity could only be detected using phenazine methosulphate as electron acceptor.
3224,No activity was observed with natural electron acceptors such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide or flavin adenine dinucleotide.
3225,The two novel reactions presented here demonstrate that the original methyl-group of 2-methylnaphthalene is oxidised to the carboxyl group of 2-naphthoic acid in the upper part of the anaerobic degradation pathway.A survey of agricultural chemicals in Wisconsin groundwater was conducted between October 2000 and April 2001 to obtain a current picture of agricultural chemicals in groundwater used for private drinking water.
3226,"A stratified, random sampling procedure was used to select 336 sampling locations."
3227,"Water from private drinking water wells randomly selected from within the 336 sampling locations was analyzed for 18 compounds including herbicides, herbicide metabolites, and nitrate."
3228,This report focuses on the frequency and concentration of chloroacetanilide herbicides and their metabolites.
3229,Analysis of data resulted in an estimated proportion of 38+/-5.0% of wells that contained detectable levels of a herbicide or herbicide metabolite.
3230,The most commonly detected compound was alachlor ESA with a proportion estimate of 28+/-4.6%.
3231,"Other detected compounds in order of prevalence were metolachlor ESA, metolachlor OA, alachlor OA, acetochlor ESA, and parent alachlor."
3232,Estimates of the mean concentration for the detects ranged from 0.15+/-0.082 microg/L for acetochlor ESA to 1.8+/-0.60 microg/L for alachlor OA.
3233,Water quality standards have not been developed for these chloroacetanilide herbicide metabolites.
3234,The results of this survey emphasize the need for toxicological assessments of herbicide metabolite compounds and establishment of water quality standards at the state and federal levels.A bacterial strain able to grow in pure culture with chrysene as sole added carbon and energy source was isolated from PAH-contaminated soil after successive enrichment cultures in a biphasic growth medium.
3235,"Initially, growth occurred in the form of a biofilm at the interface between the aqueous and non-aqueous liquid phases."
3236,"However, after a certain time, a transition occurred in the enrichment cultures, with growth occurring in suspension and a concomitant increase in the rate of chrysene degradation."
3237,"The strain responsible for chrysene degradation in these cultures, named Sphingomonas sp."
3238,"CHY-1, was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as a novel sphingomonad, the closest relative in the databases being Sphingomonas xenophaga BN6T (96% sequence identity)."
3239,"Both these strains clustered with members of the genera Sphingobium and Rhizomonas, but could not be categorically assigned to either genus."
3240,Sphingomonas sp.
3241,"CHY-1 was characterized in terms of its growth on chrysene and other PAH, and the kinetics of chrysene degradation and 14C-chrysene mineralization were measured."
3242,"At an initial chrysene concentration of 0.5 g l(-1) silicone oil, and an organic/aqueous phase ratio of 1:4, chrysene was 50% degraded after 5 days incubation and 97.5% degraded after 35 days."
3243,"The protein content of cultures reached a maximum value of 11.5 microg ml(-1) aqueous phase, corresponding to 92 mg g(-1) chrysene."
3244,"14C-labelled chrysene was 50% mineralized after 6-8 weeks incubation, 10.7% of the radioactivity was incorporated into cell biomass and 8.4% was found in the aqueous culture supernatant."
3245,Sphingomonas sp.
3246,"CHY-1 also grew on naphthalene, phenanthrene and anthracene, and naphthalene was the preferred substrate, with a doubling time of 6.9 h.N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a potential carcinogen, was commonly found in treated wastewater as a by-product of chlorination."
3247,"As treated water is increasingly used for landscape irrigation, there is an imperative need to understand the leaching risk for NDMA in landscape soils."
3248,"In this study, adsorption and incubation experiments were conducted using landscape soils planted with turfgrass, ground cover, and trees."
3249,"Adsorption of NDMA was negligibly weak (K(d) < 1) in all soils, indicating that NDMA has a high potential for moving with percolating water in these soils."
3250,Degradation of NDMA occurred at different rates among these soils.
3251,"At 21 degrees C, the half-life (t(1/2)) of NDMA was 4.1 d for the ground cover soil, 5.6 d for the turfgrass soil, and 22.5 d for the tree soil."
3252,The persistence was substantially prolonged after autoclaving or when incubated at 10 degrees C. The rate of degradation was not significantly affected by the initial NDMA concentration or addition of organic and inorganic nutrient sources.
3253,"The relative persistence was inversely correlated with soil organic matter content, soil microbial biomass, and soil dehydrogenase activity, suggesting the importance of microorganisms in NDMA degradation in these soils."
3254,"These results suggest that the behavior of NDMA depends closely on the vegetation cover in a landscape system, and prolonged persistence and increased leaching may be expected in soils with sparse vegetation due to low organic matter content and limited microbial activity.High-throughput mRNA differential display (DD) was used to identify genes induced by cyclohexane in Brachymonas petroleovorans CHX, a recently isolated beta-proteobacterium that grows on cyclohexane."
3255,Two metabolic gene clusters were identified multiple times in independent reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) in the course of this DD experiment.
3256,These clusters encode genes believed to be required for cyclohexane metabolism.
3257,One gene cluster (8 kb) encodes the subunits of a multicomponent hydroxylase related to the soluble butane of Pseudomonas butanovora and methane monooxygenases (sMMO) of methanotrophs.
3258,We propose that this butane monooxygenase homologue carries out the oxidation of cyclohexane into cyclohexanol during growth.
3259,A second gene cluster (11 kb) contains almost all the genes required for the oxidation of cyclohexanol to adipic acid.
3260,Real-time PCR experiments confirmed that genes from both clusters are induced by cyclohexane.
3261,"The role of the Baeyer-Villiger cyclohexanone monooxygenase of the second cluster was confirmed by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli.Several nonylphenol isomers with alpha-quaternary carbon atoms serve as growth substrates for Sphingomonas xenophaga Bayram, whereas isomers containing hydrogen atoms at the alpha-carbon do not."
3262,"Three metabolites of 4-(1-methyloctyl)-phenol were isolated in mg quantities from cultures of strain Bayram supplemented with the growth substrate isomer 4-(1-ethyl-1,4-dimethyl-pentyl)-phenol."
3263,"They were unequivocally identified as 4-hydroxy-4-(1-methyl-octyl)-cyclohexa-2,5-dienone, 4-hydroxy-4-(1-methyl-octyl)-cyclohex-2-enone, and 2-(1-methyl-octyl)-benzene-1,4-diol by high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy."
3264,"Furthermore, two metabolites originating from 4-n-nonylphenol were identified as 4-hydroxy-4-nonyl-cyclohexa-2,5-dienone and 4-hydroxy-4-nonyl-cyclohex-2-enone by high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry."
3265,"We conclude that nonylphenols were initially hydroxylated at the ipso-position forming 4-alkyl-4-hydroxy-cyclohexa-2,5-dienones."
3266,"Dienones originating from growth substrate nonylphenol isomers underwent a rearrangement that involved a 1,2-C,O shift of the alkyl moiety as a cation to the oxygen atom of the geminal hydroxy group yielding 4-alkoxyphenols, from which the alkyl moieties can be easily detached as alcohols by known mechanisms."
3267,Dienones originating from nongrowth substrates did not undergo such a rearrangement because the missing alkyl substituents at the alpha-carbon atom prevented stabilization of the putative alpha-carbocation.
3268,"Instead they accumulated and subsequently underwent side reactions, such as 1,2-C,C shifts and dihydrogenations."
3269,"The ipso-hydroxylation and the proposed 1,2-C,O shift constitute key steps in a novel pathway that enables bacteria to detach alpha-branched alkyl moieties of alkylphenols for utilization of the aromatic part as a carbon and energy source.Xenobiotic biodegradation under anaerobic conditions such as in groundwater, sediment, landfill, sludge digesters and bioreactors has gained increasing attention over the last two decades."
3270,"This review gives a broad overview of our current understanding of and recent advances in anaerobic biodegradation of five selected groups of xenobiotic compounds (petroleum hydrocarbons and fuel additives, nitroaromatic compounds and explosives, chlorinated aliphatic and aromatic compounds, pesticides, and surfactants)."
3271,"Significant advances have been made toward the isolation of bacterial cultures, elucidation of biochemical mechanisms, and laboratory and field scale applications for xenobiotic removal."
3272,"For certain highly chlorinated hydrocarbons (e.g., tetrachlorethylene), anaerobic processes cannot be easily substituted with current aerobic processes."
3273,"For petroleum hydrocarbons, although aerobic processes are generally used, anaerobic biodegradation is significant under certain circumstances (e.g., O(2)-depleted aquifers, oil spilled in marshes)."
3274,"For persistent compounds including polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, and DDT, anaerobic processes are slow for remedial application, but can be a significant long-term avenue for natural attenuation."
3275,"In some cases, a sequential anaerobic-aerobic strategy is needed for total destruction of xenobiotic compounds."
3276,Several points for future research are also presented in this review.The water contaminant N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a probable human carcinogen whose appearance in the environment is related to the release of rocket fuel and to chlorine-based disinfection of water and wastewater.
3277,"Although this compound has been shown to be biodegradable, there is minimal information about the organisms capable of this degradation, and little is understood of the mechanisms or biochemistry involved."
3278,This study shows that bacteria expressing monooxygenase enzymes functionally similar to those demonstrated to degrade NDMA in eukaryotes have the capability to degrade NDMA.
3279,"Specifically, induction of the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) expressed by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, the propane monooxygenase (PMO) enzyme of Mycobacterium vaccae JOB-5, and the toluene 4-monooxygenases found in Ralstonia pickettii PKO1 and Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 resulted in NDMA degradation by these strains."
3280,"In each of these cases, brief exposure to acetylene gas, a suicide substrate for certain monooxygenases, inhibited the degradation of NDMA."
3281,"Further, Escherichia coli TG1/pBS(Kan) containing recombinant plasmids derived from the toluene monooxygenases found in strains PKO1 and KR1 mimicked the behavior of the parent strains."
3282,"In contrast, M. trichosporium OB3b expressing the particulate form of MMO, Burkholderia cepacia G4 expressing the toluene 2-monooxygenase, and Pseudomonas putida mt-2 expressing the toluene sidechain monooxygenase were not capable of NDMA degradation."
3283,"In addition, bacteria expressing aromatic dioxygenases were not capable of NDMA degradation."
3284,"Finally, Rhodococcus sp."
3285,"RR1 exhibited the ability to degrade NDMA by an unidentified, constitutively expressed enzyme that, unlike the confirmed monooxygenases, was not inhibited by acetylene exposure.Anaerobic biodegradation of toluene and ethylbenzene is of environmental concern and biochemical interest due to toxicity and novel reactions, respectively."
3286,The denitrifying strain EbN1 is unique in anaerobically degrading both alkylbenzenes via different pathways which converge at benzoyl coenzyme A.
3287,The organization of genes involved in both pathways was only recently determined for strain EbN1.
3288,"In the present study, global expression analysis (DNA microarray and proteomics) indicated involvement of several thus-far-unknown proteins in the degradation of both alkylbenzenes."
3289,"For example, orf68 and orf57, framing the ebd operon, are implicated in ethylbenzene degradation, and the ebA1932 and ebA1936 genes, located 7.2 kb upstream of the bbs operon, are implicated in toluene degradation."
3290,"In addition, expression studies were now possible on the level of the complete pathways."
3291,"Growth experiments demonstrated that degradative capacities for toluene and ethylbenzene could be simultaneously induced, regardless of the substrate used for adaptation."
3292,"Regulation was studied at the RNA (real-time reverse transcription-PCR and DNA microarray) and protein (two-dimensional-difference gel electrophoresis) level by using cells adapted to anaerobic growth with benzoate, toluene, ethylbenzene, or a mixture of toluene and ethylbenzene."
3293,Expression of the two toluene-related operons (bss and bbs) was specifically induced in toluene-adapted cells.
3294,"In contrast, genes involved in anaerobic ethylbenzene degradation were induced in ethylbenzene- and toluene-adapted cells, suggesting that toluene may act as a gratuitous inducer."
3295,"In agreement with the predicted sequential regulation of the ethylbenzene pathway, Ebd proteins (encoding subunits of ethylbenzene dehydrogenase) were formed in ethylbenzene- but not in acetophenone-adapted cells, while Apc proteins (subunits of predicted acetophenone carboxylase) were formed under both conditions.Arthrobacter nitroguajacolicus R\xc3\xbc61a, which utilizes quinaldine as sole source of carbon and energy, was shown to contain a conjugative linear plasmid of approximately 110 kb, named pAL1."
3296,It exhibits similarities with other linear plasmids from Actinomycetales in that it has proteins covalently attached to its 5\' ends.
3297,Southern hybridization with probes for the genes encoding quinaldine 4-oxidase and N-acetylanthranilate amidase indicated that pAL1 contains the gene cluster encoding the degradation of quinaldine to anthranilate.
3298,"A mutant of strain R\xc3\xbc61a that had lost pAL1 indeed could not convert quinaldine, but was still able to grow on anthranilate."
3299,"Conjugative transfer of pAL1 to the plasmid-less mutant of strain R\xc3\xbc61a and to Arthrobacter nicotinovorans DSM 420 (pAO1) occurred at frequencies of 5.4x10(-4) and 2.0x10(-4) per recipient, respectively, and conferred the ability to utilize quinaldine."
3300,Five other quinaldine-degrading Gram-positive strains were isolated from soil samples; 16S rDNA sequence analysis suggested the closest relationship to different Arthrobacter species.
3301,"Except for strain K2-29, all isolates contained a pAL1-like linear plasmid carrying genes encoding quinaldine conversion."
3302,"A 478 bp fragment that on pAL1 represents an intergenic region showed 100 % sequence identity in all isolates harbouring a pAL1-like plasmid, suggesting horizontal dissemination of the linear plasmid among the genus Arthrobacter.Biodegradation of endosulfan, a chlorinated cyclodiene insecticide, is generally accompanied by production of the more toxic and more persistent metabolite, endosulfan sulfate."
3303,"Since our reported endosulfan degrader, Klebsiella pneumoniae KE-1, failed to degrade endosulfan sulfate, we tried to isolate an endosulfan sulfate degrader from endosulfan-polluted soils."
3304,"Through repetitive enrichment and successive subculture using mineral salt medium containing endosulfan or endosulfan sulfate as the sole source of carbon and energy, we isolated a bacterium capable of degrading endosulfan sulfate as well as endosulfan."
3305,The bacterium KE-8 was identified as Klebsiella oxytoca from the results of 16S rDNA sequence analysis.
3306,"In biodegradation assays with KE-8 using mineral salt medium containing endosulfan (150 mg l(-1)) or endosulfan sulfate (173 mg l(-1)), the biomass was rapidly increased to an optical density at 550 nm of 1.9 in 4 days and the degradation constants for alpha- and beta-endosulfan, and endosulfan sulfate were 0.3084, 0.2983 and 0.2465 day(-1), respectively."
3307,"Analysis of the metabolites further suggested that K. oxytoca KE-8 has high potential as a biocatalyst for bioremediation of endosulfan and/or endosulfan sulfate.By using 1,4-dioxane as the sole source of carbon, a 1,4-dioxane-degrading microorganism was isolated from soil."
3308,"The fungus, termed strain A, was able to utilize 1,4-dioxane and many kinds of cyclic ethers as the sole source of carbon and was identified as Cordyceps sinensis from its 18S rRNA gene sequence."
3309,"Ethylene glycol was identified as a degradation product of 1,4-dioxane by the use of deuterated 1,4-dioxane-d8 and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis."
3310,"A degradation pathway involving ethylene glycol, glycolic acid, and oxalic acid was proposed, followed by incorporation of the glycolic acid and/or oxalic acid via glyoxylic acid into the tricarboxylic acid cycle.2-(Thiocyanomethylthio)benzothiazole (TCMTB) is a biocide used in the leather, pulp and paper, and water-treatment industries."
3311,TCMTB may enter aquatic ecosystems during its manufacture and use.
3312,"TCMTB is environmentally unstable; therefore, it is important to evaluate the toxicity of the more persistent degradation products."
3313,"This study compared the toxicity of TCMTB with its degradation products 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (2-MBT), 2-(methylthio)benzothiazole (MTBT), benzothiazole (BT), and 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (HOBT)."
3314,Toxicity was determined using Ceriodaphnia dubia 48-hour acute and 7-day chronic test protocols.
3315,"TCMTB was the most toxic compound evaluated in both the acute and chronic tests with EC50s of 15.3 and 9.64 microg/L, respectively."
3316,"2-MBT, the first degradation product, was the second most toxic compound with acute and chronic EC50s of 4.19 and 1.25 mg/L, respectively."
3317,"The toxicity of MTBT and HOBT were similar with acute EC50s of 12.7 and 15.1 mg/L and chronic EC50s of 6.36 and 8.31 mg/L, respectively."
3318,"The least toxic compound was BT with acute and chronic EC50s of 24.6 and 54.9 mg/L, respectively."
3319,TCMTB was orders of magnitude more toxic than its degradation products.
3320,"Toxicity data on these benzothiazole degradation products is important because of concerns regarding their release, degradation, persistence, and non-target organism effects in aquatic ecosystems.The interaction between the physiological electron transfer partners trimethylamine dehydrogenase (TMADH) and electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) from Methylophilus methylotrophus has been examined with particular regard to the proposal that the former protein ""imprints"" a conformational change on the latter."
3321,"The results indicate that the absorbance change previously attributed to changes in the environment of the FAD of ETF upon binding to TMADH is instead caused by electron transfer from partially reduced, as-isolated TMADH to ETF."
3322,Prior treatment of the as-isolated enzyme with the oxidant ferricenium essentially abolishes the observed spectral change.
3323,"Further, when the semiquinone form of ETF is used instead of the oxidized form, the mirror image of the spectral change seen with as-isolated TMADH and oxidized ETF is observed."
3324,This is attributable to a small amount of electron transfer in the reverse of the physiological direction.
3325,"Kinetic determination of the dissociation constant and limiting rate constant for electron transfer within the complex of (reduced) TMADH with (oxidized) ETF is reconfirmed and discussed in the context of a recently proposed model for the interaction between the two proteins that involves ""structural imprinting"" of ETF.Beta-Hexachlorocyclohexane (beta-HCH) is the most recalcitrant among the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and delta-isomers of HCH and causes serious environmental pollution problems."
3326,"We demonstrate here that the haloalkane dehalogenase LinB, reported earlier to mediate the second step in the degradation of gamma-HCH in Sphingomonas paucimobilis UT26, metabolizes beta-HCH to produce 2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorocyclohexanol.The persistence and pathways of dissipation of testosterone in three agricultural soils were examined in laboratory microcosm incubations at different soil moistures (1.7-39%) and temperatures (4-30 degrees C) using (14)C- and (3)H-labeled and unlabeled testosterone."
3327,Sterilized loam was also examined to assess possible abiotic pathways.
3328,Extractable (14)C decreased rapidly for all three soils at 30 degrees C with times to dissipate 50% of material (DT(50)) ranging from 8.5 to 21 h. Respired (14)CO(2) accounted for approximately 50% of the applied (14)C after 120 h. Androgenic activity of soil extracts declined faster than the extractable (14)C levels demonstrating that testosterone was not being converted to compounds with greater activity.
3329,"Dissipation rates of nonvolatile, extractable (3)H in loam at 7, 15, and 39% moisture were similar, but the rate in air-dried loam (1.7% moisture) was significantly reduced."
3330,"High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of extracts of (14)C-testosterone-treated loam incubated at 30 degrees C for 6 h revealed that the (14)C was distributed among the remaining testosterone and three major metabolites (4-androstene-3,17-dione, 5alpha-androstane-3,17-dione, and 1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione), which accounted for 48.7, 23.7, and 9.6% of the remaining (14)C, respectively."
3331,"Periodic analysis of soil incubated at 23, 12, and 4 degrees C showed that the rates of testosterone dissipation and metabolite appearance and subsequent dissipation were temperature dependent with rates decreasing with decreasing temperature."
3332,"In sterilized loam, 4-androstene-3,17-dione was the only metabolite detected."
3333,We conclude that testosterone is rapidly and thoroughly biodegraded in agricultural soils under a range of conditions typical of a temperate growing season and thus is unlikely to pose a long-term risk to adjacent aquatic environments.The organochlorine pesticide Lindane is the gamma-isomer of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH).
3334,"Technical grade Lindane contains a mixture of HCH isomers which include not only gamma-HCH, but also large amounts of predominantly alpha-, beta- and delta-HCH."
3335,The physical properties and persistence of each isomer differ because of the different chlorine atom orientations on each molecule (axial or equatorial).
3336,"However, all four isomers are considered toxic and recalcitrant worldwide pollutants."
3337,"Biodegradation of HCH has been studied in soil, slurry and culture media but very little information exists on in situ bioremediation of the different isomers including Lindane itself, at full scale."
3338,"Several soil microorganisms capable of degrading, and utilizing HCH as a carbon source, have been reported."
3339,"In selected bacterial strains, the genes encoding the enzymes involved in the initial degradation of Lindane have been cloned, sequenced, expressed and the gene products characterized."
3340,"HCH is biodegradable under both oxic and anoxic conditions, although mineralization is generally observed only in oxic systems."
3341,"As is found for most organic compounds, HCH degradation in soil occurs at moderate temperatures and at near neutral pH."
3342,HCH biodegradation in soil has been reported at both low and high (saturated) moisture contents.
3343,"Soil texture and organic matter appear to influence degradation presumably by sorption mechanisms and impact on moisture retention, bacterial growth and pH."
3344,Most studies report on the biodegradation of relatively low (< 500 mg/kg) concentrations of HCH in soil.
3345,"Information on the effects of inorganic nutrients, organic carbon sources or other soil amendments is scattered and inconclusive."
3346,"More in-depth assessments of amendment effects and evaluation of bioremediation protocols, on a large scale, using soil with high HCH concentrations, are needed.Differential emergence and diversity of bacterial communities from activated sludge in response to varied cultural conditions using 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) were investigated by coupling molecular analyses based on 16S rDNA with functional genes."
3347,"We employed three different cultural conditions: (1) a culture sequentially fed a high concentration (300 mg/L) of 2,4-D (HS); (2) a culture continuously fed a low concentration (10 mg/L) of 2,4-D (LC); and (3) a serial batch culture in which 1% (v/v) of culture was transferred to a fresh medium containing a high concentration (300 mg/L) of 2,4-D (HB)."
3348,The HS and LC bioreactors were operated for 3 months and HB was repeatedly transferred for 1 month.
3349,"The 2,4-D was stably degraded under all the cultural conditions tested."
3350,"PCR amplification and cloning-based analysis of functional genes using community DNAs from the cultures revealed five different oxygenase genes that may be involved in the initial step of 2,4-D degradation."
3351,"All five gene-types were present in HS, while one of the five genes, type V (tftA) was not detected in LC."
3352,"Quantitative PCR analysis showed that in HS, Ralstonia eutropha JMP 134 type-tfdA4 (type I) was the most abundant in copy number (2.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(7) copies/microg DNA) followed by RASC type-tfdA (type II) (1.8 +/- 1.0 x 10(6) copies/microg DNA), putative cadA-like gene (type IV) (2.6 +/- 0.8 x 10(5) copies/microg DNA), cadA gene (type III) (1.3 +/- 1.0 x 10(4) copies/microg DNA), and tftA gene (type V) (3.5 +/- 1.1 x 10(3) copies/microg DNA)."
3353,Similar results were obtained in LC.
3354,"In contrast, HB contained only type I and type III genes, and the type I gene was five orders of magnitude greater in copy number than the type III gene."
3355,"Denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR, amplified 16S rDNA fragments of bacterial communities in the three different cultures showed low similarity coefficient values (< or =0.35) when compared to the original activated sludge, suggesting that 2,4-D amendment caused a drastic change in the bacterial community."
3356,"Particularly, HB showed only six bands (16-18 bands in the other cultures) and very low similarity coefficient values when compared to the other communities (0.10 to HS, 0.17 to LC, and 0.0 to original sludge)."
3357,"These results indicated that serial batch culturing (HB) resulted in a phylogenetically limited number of 2,4-D degrading bacteria carrying limited catabolic genes whereas more diverse 2,4-D degraders and catabolic genes were present in HS and LC."
3358,"Therefore, the approach used for monitoring should be taken into account when one evaluates the population dynamics of contaminant-degrading bacteria at bioremediation sites.2-Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) is used as a vulcanization accelerator in rubber products that come into contact with potable drinking water."
3359,"When such products are evaluated for contact with potable water and submitted for ANSI/NSF Standard 61 certification, any chemical extracting from these products must be below an appropriate action level of exposure."
3360,"As defined by Standard 61, a total allowable concentration (TAC) is the maximum concentration of a nonregulated contaminant allowed in a public drinking water supply, and the single product allowable concentration (SPAC) is 10% of the TAC."
3361,"Currently, MBT has a TAC of 40 microg/L and a SPAC of 4 microg/L."
3362,A comprehensive health effects evaluation of MBT was performed to determine whether these action levels should be revised.
3363,Epidemiological investigations indicate that workers occupationally exposed to MBT have an increased risk of death from bladder cancer.
3364,Genotoxicity investigations in bacterial and mammalian test systems provide some evidence indicating that MBT has the potential to induce mutations and chromosomal aberrations.
3365,"Toxicity studies in rats and mice chronically exposed to MBT identified increases in various tumours, such as adrenal gland tumours, pituitary gland tumours, liver tumours and renal pelvis tumours."
3366,"The biological significance of most of these tumours is questionable due to a variety of factors, such as a lack of dose-response between tumour incidence and dose, and the effect of test article vehicle (corn oil) upon tumour rates."
3367,"Potential human health effects of exposure to MBT can be predicted from an NTP 2-year cancer study in rats, as well as epidemiological investigations in occupationally exposed workers."
3368,A comprehensive review of the epidemiological and toxicological dataset for MBT indicates that the induction of renal pelvis transitional cell tumours is the most sensitive and relevant health effects endpoint upon which to base a revised TAC and SPAC.
3369,A multistage model was used to extrapolate to low-dose MBT exposures due to the genotoxicity and clastogenicity of MBT.
3370,"A TAC of 600 microg/L was derived for MBT, and was based upon an LED10 of 157.681 mg/kg per day."
3371,"A SPAC of 60 microg/L was derived by multiplying the revised TAC by 0.10, and rounding to one significant figure."
3372,"These revised action levels are based upon the most sensitive health effects endpoint, as well as current cancer risk assessment methodology.Laboratory degradation tests with five acidic pharmaceuticals using activated sludge as inocculum under aerobic conditions were performed and microbial metabolites were analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)."
3373,Ketoprofen was partly mineralized as a sole source of carbon and energy and the metabolites determined by LC-MS suggest microbial ketoprofen degradation to proceed along the pathway known for biphenyls and related compounds.
3374,"Bezafibrate, naproxen and ibuprofen were degraded only cometabolically whereas no transformation was obtained for diclofenac."
3375,Some biodegradation intermediates in these batch tests could be tentatively identified by means of LC-MS.
3376,"The first step in microbial bezafibrate degradation appears to be the hydrolytic cleavage of the amide bond, generating well degradable 4-chlorobenzoic acid as one of the hydrolysis products."
3377,"As previously found for mammals, ether cleavage and formation of desmethylnaproxen was the initial step in microbial degradation of naproxen."
3378,Two isomers of hydroxy-ibuprofen were detected as intermediates in the mineralization of ibuprofen.
3379,"Laboratory studies suggest that naproxen and ibuprofen can be fully mineralized whereas more stable metabolites occur in microbial ketoprofen and bezafibrate transformation, that may deserve further attention."
3380,A LC-MS method for the trace analysis of these metabolites in water was developed and applied to municipal wastewater.
3381,"Municipal wastewater treatment by a membrane bioreactor may gradually improve the removal of these pharmaceuticals.Mini-Tn5-induced mutants with defects in utilization of linear terpenes such as citronellol, geraniol, citronellate and/or geranylate were isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa."
3382,One mutant was unable to utilize geraniol but showed wild-type growth with the three other acyclic terpenes tested.
3383,The Tn5 insertion site of the mutant was determined by DNA sequencing.
3384,"Comparison with the P. aeruginosa genome sequence revealed that PA3028, an ORF with high similarity on the amino acid level to molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein A2 (encoded by moeA2), was the target of mini-Tn5 in the mutant."
3385,Disruption of moeA2 in P. aeruginosa PAO1 wild-type by insertion mutagenesis resulted in the same geraniol-minus phenotype.
3386,The ability to utilize geraniol was restored to the mutant by conjugative transfer of PCR-cloned wild-type moeA2 on a broad-host-range plasmid.
3387,"Growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 on geraniol and geranial, but not on citronellol, citronellate or geranylate, was inhibited by the presence of 10 mM tungstate, a molybdenum-specific inhibitor."
3388,Inhibition by tungstate was prevented by addition of molybdate.
3389,"The results indicate that at least one step in the oxidation of geraniol to geranic acid (geranial oxidation) is a molybdenum-dependent reaction in P. aeruginosa and is different from the molybdenum-independent oxidation of citronellol to citronellate.Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6 converts vanillate and syringate to protocatechuate (PCA) and 3-O-methylgallate (3MGA) in reactions with the tetrahydrofolate-dependent O-demethylases LigM and DesA, respectively."
3390,"PCA is further degraded via the PCA 4,5-cleavage pathway, whereas 3MGA is metabolized via three distinct pathways in which PCA 4,5-dioxygenase (LigAB), 3MGA 3,4-dioxygenase (DesZ), and 3MGA O-demethylase (LigM) are involved."
3391,"In the 3MGA O-demethylation pathway, LigM converts 3MGA to gallate, and the resulting gallate appears to be degraded by a dioxygenase other than LigAB or DesZ."
3392,"Here, we isolated the gallate dioxygenase gene, desB, which encodes a 418-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 46,843 Da."
3393,The amino acid sequences of the N-terminal region (residues 1 to 285) and the C-terminal region (residues 286 to 418) of DesB exhibited ca.
3394,"40% and 27% identity with the sequences of the PCA 4,5-dioxygenase beta and alpha subunits, respectively."
3395,DesB produced in Escherichia coli was purified and was estimated to be a homodimer (86 kDa).
3396,DesB specifically attacked gallate to generate 4-oxalomesaconate as the reaction product.
3397,"The K(m) for gallate and the V(max) were determined to be 66.9 +/- 9.3 microM and 42.7 +/- 2.4 U/mg, respectively."
3398,"On the basis of the analysis of various SYK-6 mutants lacking the genes involved in syringate degradation, we concluded that (i) all of the three-ring cleavage dioxygenases are involved in syringate catabolism, (ii) the pathway involving LigM and DesB plays an especially important role in the growth of SYK-6 on syringate, and (iii) DesB and LigAB are involved in gallate degradation.The aliphatic nitramine 4-nitro-2,4-diazabutanal (NDAB; C2H5N3O3) is a ring cleavage metabolite that accumulates during the aerobic degradation of the energetic compound hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) by various Rhodococcus spp."
3399,"NDAB is also produced during the alkaline hydrolysis of either RDX or octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) and during the photolysis of RDX."
3400,"Traces of NDAB were observed in a soil sampled from an ammunition-manufacturing facility contaminated with both HMX and RDX, suggesting natural attenuation."
3401,"In this study, we report the isolation of a soil bacterium that is able to degrade NDAB under aerobic conditions."
3402,The isolate is a pink-pigmented facultative methylotroph affiliated with the genus Methylobacterium.
3403,"The strain, named Methylobacterium sp."
3404,"strain JS178, degrades NDAB as a sole nitrogen source, with concomitant growth and formation of 1 molar equivalent of nitrous oxide (N2O)."
3405,"Comparison of the growth yield of strain JS178 grown on NDAB, nitrite (NO2-), or ammonium (NH4+) as a nitrogen source revealed that 1 N equivalent is assimilated from each mole of NDAB, which completes the nitrogen mass balance."
3406,"In radiotracer experiments, strain JS178 mineralized 1 C of the NDAB produced in situ from RDX by Rhodococcus sp."
3407,strain DN22.
3408,"Studies on the regulation of NDAB degradation indicated that allantoin, an intermediate in the purine catabolic pathway and a central molecule in the storage and transport of nitrogen in plants, up-regulated the enzyme(s) involved in the degradation of the nitramine."
3409,The results reveal the potential for the sequential participation of rhodococci and methylobacteria to effect the complete degradation of RDX.Growth substrates containing an s-triazine ring are typically metabolized by bacteria to liberate 3 mol of ammonia via the intermediate cyanuric acid.
3410,"Over a 25-year period, a number of original research papers and reviews have stated that cyanuric acid is metabolized in two steps to the 2-nitrogen intermediate urea."
3411,"In the present study, allophanate, not urea, was shown to be the 2-nitrogen intermediate in cyanuric acid metabolism in all the bacteria examined."
3412,"Six different experimental results supported this conclusion: (i) synthetic allophanate was shown to readily decarboxylate to form urea under acidic extraction and chromatography conditions used in previous studies; (ii) alkaline extraction methods were used to stabilize and detect allophanate in bacteria actively metabolizing cyanuric acid; (iii) the kinetic course of allophanate formation and disappearance was consistent with its being an intermediate in cyanuric acid metabolism, and no urea was observed in those experiments; (iv) protein extracts from cells grown on cyanuric acid contained allophanate hydrolase activity; (v) genes encoding the enzymes AtzE and AtzF, which produce and hydrolyze allophanate, respectively, were found in several cyanuric acid-metabolizing bacteria; and (vi) TrzF, an AtzF homolog found in Enterobacter cloacae strain 99, was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and shown to have allophanate hydrolase activity."
3413,"In addition, we have observed that there are a large number of genes homologous to atzF and trzF distributed in phylogenetically distinct bacteria."
3414,"In total, the data indicate that s-triazine metabolism in a broad class of bacteria proceeds through allophanate via allophanate hydrolase, rather than through urea using urease.Furfural, an inhibitor of ethanol production from hemicellulose acid hydrolysates, is reductively detoxified to furfuryl alcohol by the ethanologenic bacterium Escherichia coli strain LYO1."
3415,Furfural reductase was purified 106-fold from this bacterium to approximately 50% homogeneity.
3416,"It has a native molecular mass of 135 kDa, determined by gel filtration, and subunit molecular mass of approximately 68 kDa, determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis, indicating the holoenzyme is a dimer of two similar if not identical subunits."
3417,"The enzyme shows strong activity from pH 4 to 8 (optimum pH 7.0), relatively high temperature tolerance (50-55 degrees C), and an apparent Km and Vmax for furfural of 1.5x10(-4)M and 28.5 micromol/min/mg of protein, respectively."
3418,"It catalyzes the essentially irreversible reduction of furfural with NADPH, is specific for NADPH as cofactor, and is relatively specific for the reduction of furfural and benzaldehyde; 2-acetylfuran, xylose, and glucose were not reduced, while acetaldehyde was reduced at a rate 25-fold lower than furfural."
3419,"This is the first description of a furfural reductase which, based upon size and substrate specificity, appears to represent a new type of alcohol-aldehyde oxido-reductase."
3420,The conversion of relatively toxic furfural to less toxic furfuryl alcohol suggests a beneficial role for this enzyme in mitigating furfural toxicity encountered during ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.Rhodococcus sp.
3421,strain YU6 was isolated from soil for the ability to grow on o-xylene as the sole carbon and energy source.
3422,"Unlike most other o-xylene-degrading bacteria, YU6 is able to grow on p-xylene."
3423,"Numerous growth substrate range experiments, in addition to the ring-cleavage enzyme assay data, suggest that YU6 initially metabolizes o- and p-xylene by direct aromatic ring oxidation."
3424,"This leads to the formation of dimethylcatechols, which was further degraded largely through meta-cleavage pathway."
3425,The gene encoding meta-cleavage dioxygenase enzyme was PCR cloned from genomic YU6 DNA using previously known gene sequence data from the o-xylene-degrading Rhodococcus sp.
3426,strain DK17.
3427,"Subsequent sequencing of the 918-bp PCR product revealed a 98% identity to the gene, encoding methylcatechol 2,3-dioxygenase from DK17."
3428,"PFGE analysis followed by Southern hybridization with the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase gene demonstrated that the gene is located on an approximately 560-kb megaplasmid, designated pJYJ1.Comamonas testosteroni TA441 utilizes testosterone via aromatization of the A ring followed by meta-cleavage of the ring."
3429,"The product of the meta-cleavage reaction, 4,5-9,10-diseco-3-hydroxy-5,9,17-trioxoandrosta-1(10),2-dien-4-oic acid, is degraded by a hydrolase, TesD."
3430,"We directly isolated and identified two products of TesD as 9,17-dioxo-1,2,3,4,10,19-hexanorandrostan-5-oic acid and (2Z,4Z)-2-hydroxyhexa-2,4-dienoic acid."
3431,The latter was a pure 4Z isomer.
3432,"2-Hydroxyhexa-2,4-dienoic acid was converted by a hydratase, TesE, and the product isolated from the reaction solution was identified as 2-hydroxy-4-hex-2-enolactone, indicating the direct product of TesE to be 4-hydroxy-2-oxohexanoic acid.The way that nutrients cycle through atmospheric, terrestrial, oceanic and associated biotic reservoirs can constrain rates of biological production and help structure ecosystems on land and in the sea."
3433,"On a global scale, cycling of nutrients also affects the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide."
3434,"Because of their capacity for rapid growth, marine microorganisms are a major component of global nutrient cycles."
3435,Understanding what controls their distributions and their diverse suite of nutrient transformations is a major challenge facing contemporary biological oceanographers.
3436,"What is emerging is an appreciation of the previously unknown degree of complexity within the marine microbial community.1H-3-Hydroxy-4-oxoquinaldine 2,4-dioxygenase (Hod), catalyzing cleavage of its heteroaromatic substrate to form carbon monoxide and N-acetylanthranilate, belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family of enzymes."
3437,Analysis of protein variants suggested that Hod has adapted active-site residues of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold for the dioxygenolytic reaction.
3438,H251 was recently shown to act as a general base to abstract a proton from the organic substrate.
3439,"Residue S101, which corresponds to the nucleophile of the catalytic triad of alpha/beta-hydrolases, presumably participates in binding the heteroaromatic substrate."
3440,H102 and residues located in the topological region of the triad\'s acidic residue appear to influence O2 binding and reactivity.
3441,A tyrosine residue might be involved in the turnover of the ternary complex .
3442,"Absence of viscosity effects and kinetic solvent isotope effects suggests that turnover of the ternary complex, rather than substrate binding, product release, or proton movements, involves the rate-determining step in the reaction catalyzed by Hod.Pseudomonas sp."
3443,"strains C4, C5, and C6 utilize carbaryl as the sole source of carbon and energy."
3444,"Identification of 1-naphthol, salicylate, and gentisate in the spent media; whole-cell O2 uptake on 1-naphthol, 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, salicylaldehyde, salicylate, and gentisate; and detection of key enzymes, viz, carbaryl hydrolase, 1-naphthol hydroxylase, 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase, and gentisate dioxygenase, in the cell extract suggest that carbaryl is metabolized via 1-naphthol, 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, and gentisate."
3445,"Here, we demonstrate 1-naphthol hydroxylase and 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase activities in the cell extracts of carbaryl-grown cells."
3446,"1-Naphthol hydroxylase is present in the membrane-free cytosolic fraction, requires NAD(P)H and flavin adenine dinucleotide, and has optimum activity in the pH range 7.5 to 8.0."
3447,"Carbaryl-degrading enzymes are inducible, and maximum induction was observed with carbaryl."
3448,"Based on these results, the proposed metabolic pathway is carbaryl --> 1-naphthol --> 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene --> salicylaldehyde --> salicylate --> gentisate --> maleylpyruvate.Although ibuprofen  is one of the most widely consumed drugs in the world, little is known regarding its degradation by environmental bacteria."
3449,Sphingomonas sp.
3450,strain Ibu-2 was isolated from a wastewater treatment plant based on its ability to use ibuprofen as a sole carbon and energy source.
3451,"A slight preference toward the R enantiomer was observed, though both ibuprofen enantiomers were metabolized."
3452,"A yellow color, indicative of meta-cleavage, accumulated transiently in the culture supernatant when Ibu-2 was grown on ibuprofen."
3453,"When and only when 3-flurocatechol was used to poison the meta-cleavage system, isobutylcatechol was identified in the culture supernatant via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis."
3454,"Ibuprofen-induced washed-cell suspensions also metabolized phenylacetic acid and 2-phenylpropionic acid to catechol, while 3- and 4-tolylacetic acids and 2-(4-tolyl)-propionic acid were metabolized to the corresponding methyl catechols before ring cleavage."
3455,"These data suggest that, in contrast to the widely distributed coenzyme A ligase, homogentisate, or homoprotocatechuate pathway for metabolism of phenylacetic acid and similar compounds, Ibu-2 removes the acidic side chain of ibuprofen and related compounds prior to ring cleavage.The metabolism of 2,6-naphthalenedisulfonate (26NDS) by Pigmentiphaga sp."
3456,NDS-2 was analyzed by isolating a mutant (NDS2-002) which slowly grew on a minimal medium containing 26NDS as the sole source of carbon.
3457,Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of metabolic intermediates in this strain revealed that 5-sulfosalicylate (5SSA) is accumulated during the degradation of 26NDS.
3458,"To analyze the lower metabolic pathway, a mutant strain NDS2-008, which could not grow either on 26NDS, 5SSA or gentisate, but could on succinate as the carbon source, was isolated."
3459,"When the resting cells of NDS2-008 were incubated with 5SSA or gentisate, a substance deduced to be maleylpyruvate (Zhou et al., J."
3460,"Bacteriol., 183, 700-708, 2001) was commonly detected upon HPLC analysis."
3461,These results suggest that Pigmentiphaga sp.
3462,"NDS-2 degrades 26NDS via 5SSA, gentisate and maleylpyruvate as intermediates.A triazophos-degrading strain, Klebsiella sp."
3463,"E6, was isolated by enrichment technology from soil that had been exposed long-term to triazophos."
3464,The strain grew well at pH 7.0-8.0 with a broad temperature profile ranging from 32 to 37 degrees C. It could keep good growth on methanol as carbon source and TAP as additional carbon source or nitrogen source.
3465,"The experiment on the degradation activities of strain E6 showed that it utilized TAP more effectively when TAP was supplied as the sole nitrogen source, as opposed to additional carbon source."
3466,"The intermediates of triazophos metabolism indicated that degradation occurred through a hydrolysis mechanism, one of the products of which, 1-phenyl-3-hydroxy-1,2,4-triazole, was also mineralized by strain E6.Atrazine degradation previously has been shown to be carried out by individual bacterial species or by relatively simple consortia that have been isolated using enrichment cultures."
3467,"Here, the degradative pathway for atrazine was examined for a complex 8-membered enrichment culture."
3468,The species composition of the culture was determined by PCR-DGGE.
3469,"The bacterial species included Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas putida, Sphingomonas yaniokuyae, Nocardia sp., Rhizobium sp., Flavobacterium oryzihabitans, and Variovorax paradoxus."
3470,"All of the isolates were screened for the presence of known genes that function for atrazine degradation including atzA,-B,-C,-D,-E,-F and trzD,-N. Dechlorination of atrazine, which was obligatory for complete mineralization, was carried out exclusively by Nocardia sp., which contained the trzN gene."
3471,"Following dechlorination, the resulting product, hydroxyatrazine was further degraded via two separate pathways."
3472,In one pathway Nocardia converted hydroxyatrazine to N-ethylammelide via an unidentified gene product.
3473,"In the second pathway, hydroxyatrazine generated by Nocardia sp."
3474,"was hydrolyzed to N-isopropylammelide by Rhizobium sp., which contained the atzB gene."
3475,"Each member of the enrichment culture contained atzC, which is responsible for ring cleavage, but none of the isolates carried the atzD,-E, or -F genes."
3476,Each member further contained either trzD or exhibited urease activity.
3477,The enrichment culture was destabilized by loss of Nocardia sp.
3478,"when grown on ethylamine, ethylammelide, and cyanuric acid, after which the consortium was no longer able to degrade atrazine."
3479,The analysis of this enrichment culture highlights the broad level bacterial community interactions that may be involved in atrazine degradation in nature.An anaerobic coculture was enriched from a hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) polluted soil.
3480,The coculture reductively dechlorinates the beta-HCH isomer to benzene and chlorobenzene in a ratio of 0.5-2 depending on the amount of beta-HCH degraded.
3481,"The culture grows with H(2) as electron donor and beta-HCH as electron acceptor, indicating that dechlorination is a respiratory process."
3482,Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the coculture consists of two bacteria that are both related to gram-positive bacteria with a low G + C content of the DNA.
3483,One bacterium was identified as a Dehalobacter sp.
3484,This bacterium is responsible for the dechlorination.
3485,The other bacterium was isolated and characterized as being a Sedimentibacter sp.
3486,This strain is not able to dechlorinate beta-HCH.
3487,The Dehalobacter sp.
3488,"requires the presence of Sedimentibacter for growth and dechlorination, but the function of the latter bacterium is not clear."
3489,This is the first report on the metabolic dechlorination of beta-HCH by a defined anaerobic bacterial culture.3-Chlorobenzoate-grown cells of Pseudomonas sp.
3490,B13 readily cometabolized monofluorobenzoates.
3491,A catabolic pathway for the isomeric fluorobenzoates is proposed on the basis of key metabolites isolated.
3492,Only 4-fluorobenzoate was utilized and totally degraded after a short period of adaptation.
3493,"The isoenzymes for total degradation of chlorocatechols, being found during growth with 3-chlorobenzoate or 4-chlorophenol, were not induced in the presence of fluorobenzoates."
3494,"Correspondingly, only the ordinary enzymes of the benzoate pathway were detected in 4-fluorobenzoate-grown cells."
3495,Ring cleavage of 3-fluorocatechol was recognized as a critical step in 3-fluorobenzoate degradation.
3496,"2-Fluoro-cis,cis-muconic acid was identified as a dead-end metabolite from 2- and 3-fluorobenzoate catabolism."
3497,"During 2-fluorobenzoate cometabolism, fluoride is eliminated by the initial dioxygenation.Naphthalene and two naphthalenesulfonic acids were degraded by Pseudomonas sp."
3498,A3 and Pseudomonas sp.
3499,C22 by the same enzymes.
3500,Gentisate is a major metabolite.
3501,"Catabolic activities for naphthalene, 1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, and 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid are induced by growth with naphthalene, 1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, 2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, methylnaphthalene, or salicylate."
3502,Gentisate is also an inducer in strain A3.
3503,Inhibition kinetics show that naphthalene and substituted naphthalenes are hydroxylated by the same naphthalene dioxygenase.
3504,"Substrates with nondissociable substituents such as CH(3), OCH(3), Cl, or NO(2) are hydroxylated in the 7,8-position, and 4-substituted salicylates are accumulated."
3505,"If CO(2)H, CH(2)CO(2)H, or SO(3)H are substituents, hydroxylation occurs with high regioselectivity in the 1,2-position."
3506,"Thus, 1,2-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-2-carboxylic acids are formed quantitatively from the corresponding naphthalenecarboxylic acids."
3507,"Utilization of naphthalenesulfonic acids proceeds by the same regioselective 1,2-dioxygenation which labilizes the C-SO(3) bond and eliminates sulfite.A strictly anaerobic bacterium was isolated from a continuous fermentor culture which converted the organic constituents of sulfite evaporator condensate to methane and carbon dioxide."
3508,Furfural is one of the major components of this condensate.
3509,This furfural isolate could degrade furfural as the sole source of carbon and energy in a defined mineral-vitamin-sulfate medium.
3510,Acetic acid was the major fermentation product.
3511,"This organism could also use ethanol, lactate, pyruvate, or fumarate and contained cytochrome c(3) and desulfoviridin."
3512,"Except for furfural degradation, the characteristics of the furfural isolate were remarkably similar to those of the sulfate reducer Desulfovibrio gigas."
3513,The furfural isolate has been tentatively identified as Desulfovibrio sp.
3514,strain F-1.N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was mineralized by microorganisms in aqueous and soil systems.
3515,Initial rates of mineralization (micrograms per milliliter per day) were calculated for a wide range of initial concentrations of NDMA (micrograms per milliliter to picograms per milliliter).
3516,"Log-log plots of the data were fitted with both linear and nonlinear least-squares analyses; however, linear models provided better fits for the kinetic data in all cases."
3517,"The slopes of the linear fits were not significantly different than 1.0 (P < 0.05); thus, first-order reaction kinetics were in effect over the range of concentrations tested, and saturation kinetics were not achieved."
3518,Rate constants (day) and total percent mineralized increased with decreasing initial concentrations of NDMA.
3519,"Rates of mineralization were reduced in aqueous systems when supplemental carbon was available, whereas in soils, percentages of organic matter and supplemental carbon had little effect on rates of mineralization."
3520,Implications of these results for predictions of rates and threshold limits of mineralization activity in natural systems are discussed.
3521,A laboratory scale simulated trickling filter containing an activated charcoal bed provided a suitable environment for mineralization of NDMA at concentrations of 50 and 100 mug/ml on a continuous basis.
3522,NDMA was not toxic to natural populations of microorganisms at concentrations up to 10 mg/ml.
3523,"Using high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled with radioactivity detection, we identified formaldehyde and methylamine as intermediates produced during the biodegradation of NDMA.Methyl fluoride (MF) and dimethyl ether (DME) were effective inhibitors of aerobic methanotrophy in a variety of soils."
3524,"MF and DME blocked consumption of CH(4) as well as the oxidation of CH(4) to CO(2), but neither MF nor DME affected the oxidation of methanol or formate to CO(2)."
3525,Cooxidation of ethane and propane by methane-oxidizing soils was also inhibited by MF.
3526,Nitrification (ammonia oxidation) in soils was inhibited by both MF and DME.
3527,"Production of N(2)O via nitrification was inhibited by MF; however, MF did not affect N(2)O production associated with denitrification."
3528,Methanogenesis was partially inhibited by MF but not by DME.
3529,"Methane oxidation was approximately 100-fold more sensitive to MF than was methanogenesis, indicating that an optimum concentration could be employed to selectively block methanotrophy."
3530,"MF inhibited methane oxidation by cell suspensions of Methylococcus capsulatus; however, DME was a much less effective inhibitor.Because of its high electron deficiency, initial microbial transformations of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) are characterized by reductive rather than oxidation reactions."
3531,"The reduction of the nitro groups seems to be the dominating mechanism, whereas hydrogenation of the aromatic ring, as described for picric acid, appears to be of minor importance."
3532,"Thus, two bacterial strains enriched with TNT as a sole source of nitrogen under aerobic conditions, a gram-negative strain called TNT-8 and a gram-positive strain called TNT-32, carried out nitro-group reduction."
3533,"In contrast, both a picric acid-utilizing Rhodococcus erythropolis strain, HL PM-1, and a 4-nitrotoluene-utilizing Mycobacterium sp."
3534,"strain, HL 4-NT-1, possessed reductive enzyme systems, which catalyze ring hydrogenation, i.e., the addition of a hydride ion to the aromatic ring of TNT."
3535,"The hydride-Meisenheimer complex thus formed (H-TNT) was further converted to a yellow metabolite, which by electrospray mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectral analyses was established as the protonated dihydride-Meisenheimer complex of TNT (2H-TNT)."
3536,"Formation of hydride complexes could not be identified with the TNT-enriched strains TNT-8 and TNT-32, or with Pseudomonas sp."
3537,"clone A (2NT), for which such a mechanism has been proposed."
3538,"Correspondingly, reductive denitration of TNT did not occur.This study investigated the feasibility of a slow-release inoculation approach as a bioaugmentation strategy for the degradation of lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane )."
3539,Slow-release inoculation of Sphingomonas sp.
3540,gamma 1-7 was established in both liquid and soil slurry microcosms using open-ended silicone tubes in which the bacteria are encapsulated in a protective nutrient-rich matrix.
3541,The capacity of the encapsulated cells to degrade lindane under aerobic conditions was evaluated in comparison with inoculation of free-living cells.
3542,Encapsulation of cells in tubes caused the removal of lindane by adsorption to the silicone tubes but also ensured prolonged biodegradation activity.
3543,"Lindane degradation persisted 2.2 and 1.4 times longer for liquid and soil slurry microcosms, respectively, than that for inoculation with free cells."
3544,"While inoculation of free-living cells led to a loss in lindane-degrading activity in limited time intervals, encapsulation in tubes allowed for a more stable actively degrading community."
3545,"The loss in degrading activity was linked to the loss of the linA gene, encoding gamma-HCH dehydrochlorinase (LinA), which is involved in the initial steps of the lindane degradation pathway."
3546,"This work shows that a slow-release inoculation approach using a catabolic strain encapsulated in open-ended tubes is a promising bioaugmentation tool for contaminated sites, as it can enhance pollutant removal and can prolong the degrading activity in comparison with traditional inoculation strategies.Nitrogen is a vital component in living organisms as it participates in the making of essential biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, etc."
3547,"In the biosphere, nitrogen cycles between the oxidation states +V and -III producing many species that constitute the biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen."
3548,"All reductive branches of this cycle involve the conversion of nitrate to nitrite, which is catalyzed by the enzyme nitrate reductase."
3549,The characterization of nitrate reductases from prokaryotic organisms has allowed us to gain considerable information on the molecular basis of nitrate reduction.
3550,"Prokaryotic nitrate reductases are mononuclear Mo-containing enzymes sub-grouped as respiratory nitrate reductases, periplasmic nitrate reductases and assimilatory nitrate reductases."
3551,"We review here the biological and molecular properties of these three enzymes along with their gene organization and expression, which are necessary to understand the biological processes involved in nitrate reduction.Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) was applied to improve the separation of 4-nonylphenol isomers and their biodegradation products."
3552,The structurally similar nonylphenol isomers were separated by combining a 30 m long semi-polar column and a short polar capillary.
3553,Both were coupled via a custom-made liquid nitrogen cryogenic modulator.
3554,"The advanced GC resolution of coeluting isomers, additionally supported by fast scanning TOF-MS, provided clearer, non-interfered mass spectra of individual isomers."
3555,"Thus, identification of components is facilitated as shown for isomeric 4-nonylphenols and metabolites of their biodegradation by Clavariopsis aquatica, an aquatic fungus."
3556,GC x GC-TOF-MS analysis enabled the separation of about 40 alkylphenol isomers included in technical 4-nonylphenol.
3557,During biodegradation the variety of emerging compounds increased with longer reaction time.
3558,"The comprehensive analysis indicated a broad spectrum of hydroxylated, carboxylated nonylphenolisomers and additionally, chlorinated aromatic compounds produced and released from the fungal culture.The effect of post-treatment with diphenyl diselenide on liver damage induced by 2-nitropropane (2-NP) was examined in male rats."
3559,Rats were pre-treated with a single dose of 2-NP (100 mg/kg body weight dissolved in canola oil).
3560,"Afterward, the animals were post-treated with a dose of diphenyl diselenide (10, 50 or 100 micromol/kg)."
3561,"The parameters that indicate tissue damage such as liver histopathology, plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), urea and creatinine were determined."
3562,"Since the liver damage induced by 2-NP is related to oxidative damage, lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbic acid level were also evaluated."
3563,Diphenyl diselenide (50 and 100 micromol/kg) effectively restored the increase of ALT and AST activities and urea level when compared to the 2-NP group.
3564,"At the higher dose, diphenyl diselenide decreased GGT activity."
3565,"Treatment with diphenyl diselenide, at all doses, effectively ameliorated the increase of hepatic and renal lipid peroxidation when compared to 2-NP group."
3566,2-NP reduced CAT activity and neither alter SOD activity nor ascorbic acid level.
3567,This study points out the involvement of CAT activity in 2-NP-induced acute liver damage and suggests that the post-treatment with diphenyl diselenide was effective in restoring the hepatic damage induced by 2-NP.The high hydrophobicity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) greatly hamper their degradation in liquid media.
3568,The use of an organic solvent can assist the degradative action of ligninolytic enzymes from white rot fungi.
3569,"The enzymatic action of the enzyme manganese peroxidase (MnP) in media containing a miscible organic solvent, acetone (36% v/v), was evaluated as a feasible system for the in vitro degradation of three PAHs: anthracene, dibenzothiophene and pyrene."
3570,"These compounds were degraded to a large extent after a short period of time (7, 24 and 24h, respectively), at conditions maximizing the MnP-oxidative system."
3571,The initial amount of enzyme present in the reaction medium was determinant for the kinetics of the process.
3572,"The order of degradability, in terms of degradation rates was as follows: anthracene>dibenzothiophene>pyrene."
3573,The intermediate compounds were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the degradation mechanisms were proposed.
3574,Anthracene was degraded to phthalic acid.
3575,"A ring cleavage product of the oxidation of dibenzothiophene, 4-methoxybenzoic acid, was also observed.The cascade of reactive nitrogen species generated from nitric oxide causes modification of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids in a wide range of organisms."
3576,3-Nitrotyrosine is one of the most common products of the action of reactive nitrogen species on proteins.
3577,"Although a great deal is known about the formation of 3-nitrotyrosine, the subsequent metabolism of this compound is a mystery."
3578,Variovorax paradoxus JS171 and Burkholderia sp.
3579,"strain JS165 were isolated from soil slurries when 3-nitrotyrosine was provided as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source."
3580,During growth on 3-nitrotyrosine stoichiometric amounts of nitrite were released along with approximately one-half of the theoretically available ammonia.
3581,The catabolic pathway involving oxidative denitration is distinct from the pathway for tyrosine metabolism.
3582,"The facile isolation and the specific, regulated pathway for 3-nitrotyrosine degradation in natural ecosystems suggest that there is a significant flux of 3-nitrotyrosine in such environments.The bacterium Sinorhizobium morelense S-30.7.5 was isolated by a microbial screening using the sugar 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (AF) as the sole carbon source."
3583,"This strain metabolized AF by a novel pathway involving its reduction to 1,5-anhydro-D-mannitol (AM) and the further conversion of AM to D-mannose by C-1 oxygenation."
3584,Growth studies showed that the AF metabolizing capability is not confined to S. morelense S-30.7.5 but is a more common feature among the Rhizobiaceae.
3585,"The AF reducing enzyme was purified and characterized as a new NADPH-dependent monomeric reductase (AFR, EC 1.1.1.-) of 35.1 kDa."
3586,It catalyzed the stereoselective reduction of AF to AM and also the conversion of a number of 2-keto aldoses (osones) to the corresponding manno-configurated aldoses.
3587,"In contrast, common aldoses and ketoses, as well as nonsugar aldehydes and ketones, were not reduced."
3588,A database search using the N-terminal AFR sequence retrieved a putative 35-kDa oxidoreductase encoded by the open reading frame Smc04400 localized on the chromosome of Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021.
3589,"Based on sequence information for this locus, the afr gene was cloned from S. morelense S-30.7.5 and overexpressed in Escherichia coli."
3590,"In addition to the oxidoreductase of S. meliloti 1021, AFR showed high sequence similarities to putative oxidoreductases of Mesorhizobium loti, Brucella suis, and B. melitensis but not to any oxidoreductase with known functions."
3591,AFR could be assigned to the GFO/IDH/MocA family on the basis of highly conserved common structural features.
3592,"His6-tagged AFR was used to demonstrate the utility of this enzyme for AF analysis and synthesis of AM, as well as related derivatives.Coffee is a complex mixture of chemicals that provides significant amounts of chlorogenic acid and caffeine."
3593,"Unfiltered coffee is a significant source of cafestol and kahweol, which are diterpenes that have been implicated in the cholesterol-raising effects of coffee."
3594,"The results of epidemiological research suggest that coffee consumption may help prevent several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson\'s disease and liver disease (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma)."
3595,Most prospective cohort studies have not found coffee consumption to be associated with significantly increased cardiovascular disease risk.
3596,"However, coffee consumption is associated with increases in several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure and plasma homocysteine."
3597,"At present, there is little evidence that coffee consumption increases the risk of cancer."
3598,"For adults consuming moderate amounts of coffee (3-4 cups/d providing 300-400 mg/d of caffeine), there is little evidence of health risks and some evidence of health benefits."
3599,"However, some groups, including people with hypertension, children, adolescents, and the elderly, may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of caffeine."
3600,"In addition, currently available evidence suggests that it may be prudent for pregnant women to limit coffee consumption to 3 cups/d providing no more than 300 mg/d of caffeine to exclude any increased probability of spontaneous abortion or impaired fetal growth.Evidence suggests that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 gnyRDBHAL cluster, which is involved in acyclic isoprenoid degradation (A. L. D\xc3\xadaz-P\xc3\xa9rez, N. A. Zavala-Hern\xc3\xa1ndez, C. Cervantes, and J. Campos-Garc\xc3\xada, Appl."
3601,Environ.
3602,Microbiol.
3603,"70:5102-5110, 2004), corresponds to the liuRABCDE cluster (B. Hoschle, V. Gnau, and D. Jendrossek, Microbiology 151:3649-3656, 2005)."
3604,"A liu (leucine and isovalerate utilization) homolog cluster was found in the PAO1 genome and is related to the catabolism of acyclic monoterpenes of the citronellol family (AMTC); it was named the atu cluster (acyclic terpene utilization), consisting of the atuCDEF genes and lacking the hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (CoA) lyase (HMG-CoA lyase) homolog."
3605,"Mutagenesis of the atu and liu clusters showed that both are involved in AMTC and leucine catabolism by encoding the enzymes related to the geranyl-CoA and the 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA pathways, respectively."
3606,"Intermediary metabolites of the acyclic monoterpene pathway, citronellic and geranic acids, were accumulated, and leucine degradation rates were affected in both atuF and liuD mutants."
3607,"The alpha subunit of geranyl-CoA carboxylase and the alpha subunit of 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (alpha-MCCase), encoded by the atuF and liuD genes, respectively, were both induced by citronellol, whereas only the alpha-MCCase subunit was induced by leucine."
3608,Both citronellol and leucine also induced a LacZ transcriptional fusion at the liuB gene.
3609,"The liuE gene encodes a probable hydroxy-acyl-CoA lyase (probably HMG-CoA lyase), an enzyme with bifunctional activity that is essential for both AMTC and leucine degradation."
3610,P. aeruginosa PAO1 products encoded by the liuABCD cluster showed a higher sequence similarity (77.2 to 79.5%) with the probable products of liu clusters from several Pseudomonas species than with the atuCDEF cluster from PAO1 (41.5%).
3611,Phylogenetic studies suggest that the atu cluster from P. aeruginosa could be the result of horizontal transfer from Alphaproteobacteria.
3612,"Our results suggest that the atu and liu clusters are bifunctional operons involved in both the AMTC and leucine catabolic pathways.Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was determined in 36 species of rhizosphere bacteria with the substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) and in 18 strains with the herbicide alachlor."
3613,"Highest levels of CDNB-GST activity (60 to 222 nmol (middot) h(sup-1) (middot) mg(sup-1)) were found in gram-negative bacteria: Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter diversus, Klebsiella planticola, Pseudomonas cepacia, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Xanthomonas campestris."
3614,There was very low CDNB-GST activity in the gram-positive strains.
3615,"Rapid metabolism of CDNB-glutathione conjugates, attributable to high levels of (gamma)-glutamyltranspeptidase, also occurred in the gram-negative bacteria, especially pseudomonads."
3616,"Alachlor-GST activity detected in cell extracts and whole-cell suspensions of some strains of the families Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae was 50- to 100-fold lower than CDNB-GST activity (0.5 to 2.5 nmol (middot) h(sup-1) (middot) mg(sup-1)) and was, for the most part, constitutive."
3617,The glutathione-alachlor conjugate was rarely detected.
3618,Cysteineglycine and/or cysteine conjugates were the major products of alachlor-GST metabolism.
3619,Whole-cell suspensions of certain Pseudomonas spp.
3620,"dechlorinated from 20 to 75% of 100 (mu)M alachlor in 24 h. Results indicate that rhizosphere bacteria, especially fluorescent pseudomonads, may play an important role in the degradation of xenobiotics such as alachlor via GST-mediated reactions.Oxidation of acenaphthene, acenaphthylene, and fluorene was examined with recombinant strain Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1(pRE695) expressing naphthalene dioxygenase genes cloned from plasmid NAH7."
3621,"Acenaphthene underwent monooxygenation to 1-acenaphthenol with subsequent conversion to 1-acenaphthenone and cis- and trans-acenaphthene-1,2-diols, while acenaphthylene was dioxygenated to give cis-acenaphthene-1,2-diol."
3622,"Nonspecific dehydrogenase activities present in the host strain led to the conversion of both of the acenaphthene-1,2-diols to 1,2-acenaphthoquinone."
3623,"The latter was oxidized spontaneously to naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid."
3624,No aromatic ring dioxygenation products were detected from acenaphthene and acenaphthylene.
3625,"Mixed monooxygenase and dioxygenase actions of naphthalene dioxygenase on fluorene yielded products of benzylic 9-monooxygenation, aromatic ring dioxygenation, or both."
3626,"The action of naphthalene dioxygenase on a variety of methyl-substituted aromatic compounds, including 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and isomers of dimethylnaphthalene, resulted in the formation of benzylic alcohols, i.e., methyl group monooxygenation products, which were subsequently converted to the corresponding carboxylic acids by dehydrogenase(s) in the host strain."
3627,Benzylic monooxygenation of methyl groups was strongly predominant over aromatic ring dioxygenation and essentially nonspecific with respect to the substitution pattern of the aromatic substrates.
3628,"In addition to monooxygenating benzylic methyl and methylene groups, naphthalene dioxygenase behaved as a sulfoxygenase, catalyzing monooxygenation of the sulfur heteroatom of 3-methylbenzothiophene.Aerobic and anoxic biotransformation of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) was examined by using a Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain isolated from a plant treating propellant manufacturing wastewater."
3629,DNT biotransformation in the presence and absence of oxygen was mostly reductive and was representative of the type of cometabolic transformations that occur when a high concentration of an easily degradable carbon source is present.
3630,"P. aeruginosa reduced both nitro groups on DNT, with the formation of mainly 4-amino-2-nitrotoluene and 2-amino-4-nitrotoluene and small quantities of 2,4-diaminotoluene."
3631,Acetylation of the arylamines was a significant reaction.
3632,"4-Acetamide-2-nitrotoluene and the novel compounds 2-acetamide-4-nitrotoluene, 4-acetamide-2-aminotoluene, and 2,4-diacetamidetoluene were identified as DNT metabolites."
3633,"The biotransformation of 2,4-diaminotoluene to 4-acetamide-2-aminotoluene was 24 times faster than abiotic transformation."
3634,2-Nitrotoluene and 4-nitrotoluene were also reduced to their corresponding toluidines and then acetylated.
3635,"However, the yield of 4-acetamidetoluene was much higher than that of 2-acetamidetoluene, demonstrating that acetylation at the position para to the methyl group was favored.Pseudomonas strain AT3, isolated by elective culture with atropine, hydrolyzed atropine and grew diauxically, first on the tropic acid and then on the tropine."
3636,Tropine was also used as a sole carbon and energy source.
3637,"The methyl group of tropine was eliminated as formaldehyde, and the nortropine thus formed was a precursor of 6-hydroxycyclohepta-1,4-dione."
3638,Ammonia was detected as a product of nitrogen elimination.
3639,"6-Hydroxycyclohepta-1,4-dione was oxidized to cyclohepta-1,3,5-trione by an induced NAD(sup+)-specific dehydrogenase."
3640,"Although cyclohepta-1,3,5-trione is a (beta)-diketone with two potential hydrolytic cleavage sites, an induced hydrolase was specific for one of these sites, with 4,6-dioxoheptanoate as the only hydrolysis product."
3641,"Unlike the alternative cleavage product (3,6-dioxoheptanoate), this compound is also a (beta)-diketone, and a second hydrolytic cleavage formed succinate and acetone."
3642,"Although Pseudomonas strain AT3 was not capable of growth with acetone, the compound was not detected in the culture medium and may have been lost to the atmosphere."
3643,"Exhaustive experimentation with a wide range of conditions did not result in detection of the enzymes required for cleavage of the carbon-nitrogen bonds leading to the formation of nortropine and 6-hydroxycyclohepta-1,4-dione.The metabolic conversion of 5-methylfurfural and 2-methylfurfural to furfural by a methanogenic bacterium, Methanococcus sp."
3644,"strain B, was studied."
3645,This bacterium was found to use methylfurfural compounds as a growth substrate and to convert them stoichiometrically to furfural.
3646,"For every mole of methylfurfurals metabolized, almost 1 mol of furfural and 0.7 mol of methane were produced."
3647,Several methanogenic bacteria did not carry out this conversion.
3648,The metabolic conversion of methylfurfurals is likely to be of value in the anaerobic treatment of methylfurfural-containing wastewaters such as those produced by the paper and pulp industries and oatmeal processing industries.
3649,"This study adds to the list of the limited number of compounds that are known to serve as electron donors for methanogenesis.The in vitro oxidation of the two polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons anthracene and benzopyrene, which have ionization potentials of <=7.45 eV, is catalyzed by laccases from Trametes versicolor."
3650,Crude laccase preparations were able to oxidize both anthracene and the potent carcinogen benzopyrene.
3651,"Oxidation of benzopyrene was enhanced by the addition of the cooxidant 2,2(prm1)-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS), while an increased anthracene oxidizing ability was observed in the presence of the low-molecular-weight culture fluid ultrafiltrate."
3652,Two purified laccase isozymes from T. versicolor were found to have similar oxidative activities towards anthracene and benzopyrene.
3653,"Oxidation of anthracene by the purified isozymes was enhanced in the presence of ABTS, while ABTS was essential for the oxidation of benzopyrene."
3654,In all cases anthraquinone was identified as the major end product of anthracene oxidation.
3655,These findings indicate that laccases may have a role in the oxidation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by white rot fungi.Methanococcus deltae (Delta)LH was grown on H(inf2)-CO(inf2) in the presence of various concentrations of furfural.
3656,"Furfural at higher concentrations, namely, 20 and 25 mM, inhibited growth of this organism."
3657,"At concentration of 5 and 10 mM, no inhibition of growth was observed."
3658,The other methanogens in this study were not inhibited by 10 mM furfural.
3659,"Among the methanogens tested, M. deltae was capable of transforming furfural, whereas Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum Marburg, Methanosarcina barkeri 227, Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus, and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium lacked this capability."
3660,One hundred percent removal of furfural was observed within 48 h of incubation in M. deltae cultures.
3661,The end product observed during furfural metabolism was furfuryl alcohol.
3662,An almost stoichiometric amount of furfuryl alcohol was produced by M. deltae.
3663,This transformation is likely to be of value in the detoxification of furfural and in its ultimate conversion to methane and CO(inf2) by anaerobic digestion.Selective enrichments yielded bacterial cultures able to utilize the osmolyte N-methyltaurine as sole source of carbon and energy or as sole source of fixed nitrogen for aerobic growth.
3664,"Strain MT1, which degraded N-methyltaurine as a sole source of carbon concomitantly with growth, was identified as a strain of Alcaligenes faecalis."
3665,"Stoichiometric amounts of methylamine, whose identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted, laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and of sulfate were released during growth."
3666,"Inducible N-methyltaurine dehydrogenase, sulfoacetaldehyde acetyltransferase (Xsc) and a sulfite dehydrogenase could be detected."
3667,Taurine dehydrogenase was also present and it was hypothesized that taurine dehydrogenase has a substrate range that includes N-methyltaurine.
3668,Partial sequences of a tauY-like gene (encoding the putative large component of taurine dehydrogenase) and an xsc gene were obtained by PCR with degenerate primers.
3669,Strain N-MT utilized N-methyltaurine as a sole source of fixed nitrogen for growth and could also utilize the compound as sole source of carbon.
3670,This bacterium was identified as a strain of Paracoccus versutus.
3671,"This organism also expressed inducible (N-methyl)taurine dehydrogenase, Xsc and a sulfite dehydrogenase."
3672,"The presence of a gene cluster with high identity to a larger cluster from Paracoccus pantotrophus NKNCYSA, which is now known to dissimilate N-methyltaurine via Xsc, allowed most of the overall pathway, including transport and excretion, to be defined."
3673,"N-Methyltaurine is thus another compound whose catabolism is channelled directly through sulfoacetaldehyde.Isonicotinic acid hydrazide (Isoniazid, INH) is one of the major drugs worldwide used in the chemotherapy of tuberculosis."
3674,Many investigators have emphasized that INH activation is associated with mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase (katG).
3675,"However, INH activation mechanism is not completely understood."
3676,"In this study, katG of M. bovis BCG was separated and purified into two katGs, katG I (named as relatively higher molecular weight than katG II) and katG II, indicating that there is some difference in protein structure between two katGs."
3677,"The molecular weight of the enzymes of katG I and katG II was estimated to be approximately 150,000 Da by gel filtration, and its subunit was 75,000 Da as determined by SDS-PAGE, indicating that purified enzyme was composed of two identical subunits."
3678,The specific activity of the purified enzyme katG I was 991.1 (units/mg).
3679,The enzymes were then investigated in INH activation by using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
3680,"The analysis of GC-MS showed that the katG I from M. bovis BCG directly converted INH (Mr, 137) to isonicotinamide (Mr, 122), not to isonicotinic acid (Mr, 123), in the presence or absence of H2O2."
3681,"Therefore, this is the first report that katG I, one of two katGs with almost same molecular weight existed in M. bovis BCG, converts INH to isonicotinamide and this study may give us important new light on the activation mechanism of INH by KatG between M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis.The sulfur content of diesel fuel is of environmental concern because sulfur can facilitate the formation of diesel particulate matter (DPM) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in the exhaust can poison catalytic converters."
3682,The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established more stringent regulations to reduce the sulfur content of diesel fuels in the near future.
3683,"In this study, various types of organosulfur compounds in DPM extracts and the corresponding fuels have been determined by gas chromatography with atomic emission detection."
3684,"The diesel fuels used have sulfur contents of 2284 and 433 ppm, respectively, and are labeled as high-sulfur and low-sulfur diesel fuels."
3685,The compounds identified are mainly polycyclic aromatic sulfur heterocycles (PASHs).
3686,"In the fuels tested, trimethylbenzothiophenes (TMBTs), dibenzothiophenes (DBTs), and 4-methyldibenzothiophene (4-MDBT) were the most abundant sulfur compounds, while larger PASH compounds were more abundant in DPM extracts."
3687,The high-sulfur diesel fuel contained a larger proportion of PASHs with one or two rings (lighter PASHs).
3688,"In DPM, the concentrations of total organic sulfur and individual PASHs are higher for the high-sulfur diesel fuel, and the relative percentage of one or two-ring PASHs is higher as well."
3689,The influence of engine load on the DPM composition was also examined.
3690,"With increasing load, the PASH concentration in DPM decreased for lighter PASHs, increased for heavier PASHs, and had a bell-shaped distribution for PASHs in between.The catabolic activity of incumbent microorganisms in soil samples of eleven dissimilar soil series was investigated, with respect to the herbicide isoproturon."
3691,"Soils were collected from a 30x37 km area of river catchment to the north-west of London, England."
3692,Catabolic activity in each soil type during a 500 h assay was determined by 14C-radiorespirometry.
3693,Results showed four soils that exhibited high levels of catabolic activity (33-44% mineralisation) while the remaining seven soils showed lower levels of catabolic activity (12-16% mineralisation).
3694,"There was evidence to suggest that soils exhibiting high catabolic activity had low (<22%) clay content and tended towards lower organic carbon content (<2.7%), but that these higher levels of catabolic activity were also related to pre-exposure to isoproturon."
3695,The 14C-radiorespirometric results were used to produce a GIS layer representing levels of catabolic activity for the dissimilar soils across the study area.
3696,"This layer was combined with other GIS layers relating to pesticide attenuation, including soil organic carbon content, depth to groundwater and hydrogeology, to produce a map showing risk of groundwater contamination by isoproturon."
3697,The output from this approach was compared with output from an attenuation-only approach and differences appraised.
3698,Inclusion of the catabolism layer resulted in a lowering of risk in the model in 15% of the study area.
3699,"Although there appears to be limited benefit in including pesticide catabolic activity in this regional-scale groundwater risk model, this type of addition could be useful in a site-specific risk assessment.Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is a persistent pollutant of surface and groundwater, and the reasons for its low biodegradability are poorly documented."
3700,"Using one of the rare bacterial strains able to grow in the presence of MTBE, Mycobacterium austroafricanum IFP 2012, the protein profiles of crude extracts after growth in the presence of MTBE and glucose were compared by SDS-PAGE."
3701,"Ten proteins with molecular masses of 67, 64, 63, 55, 50, 27, 24, 17, 14 and 11 kDa were induced after growth in the presence of MTBE."
3702,"Partial amino acid sequences of N-terminal and internal peptide fragments of the 64 kDa protein were used to design degenerate oligonucleotide primers to amplify total DNA by PCR, yielding a DNA fragment that was used as a probe for cloning."
3703,"A two-step cloning procedure was performed to obtain a 10 327 bp genomic DNA fragment containing seven ORFs, including a putative regulator, mpdR, and four genes, mpdC, orf1, mpdB and orf2, in the same cluster."
3704,"The MpdB protein (64 kDa) was related to a flavoprotein of the glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family, and the MpdC protein (55 kDa) showed a high similarity with NAD(P) aldehyde dehydrogenases."
3705,Heterologous expression of these gene products was performed in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155.
3706,"The recombinant strain was able to degrade an intermediate of MTBE biodegradation, 2-methyl 1,2-propanediol, to hydroxyisobutyric acid."
3707,This is believed to be the first report of the cloning and characterization of a cluster of genes specifically involved in the MTBE biodegradation pathway of M. austroafricanum IFP 2012.Isoniazid is a key drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis.
3708,"Isoniazid is a pro-drug, which, after activation by the katG-encoded catalase peroxidase, reacts nonenzymatically with NAD(+) and NADP(+) to generate several isonicotinoyl adducts of these pyridine nucleotides."
3709,"One of these, the acyclic 4S isomer of isoniazid-NAD, targets the inhA-encoded enoyl-ACP reductase, an enzyme essential for mycolic acid biosynthesis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis."
3710,"Here we show that the acyclic 4R isomer of isoniazid-NADP inhibits the M. tuberculosis dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme essential for nucleic acid synthesis."
3711,This biologically relevant form of the isoniazid adduct is a subnanomolar bisubstrate inhibitor of M. tuberculosis DHFR.
3712,Expression of M. tuberculosis DHFR in Mycobacterium smegmatis mc(2)155 protects cells against growth inhibition by isoniazid by sequestering the drug.
3713,"Thus, M. tuberculosis DHFR is the first new target for isoniazid identified in the last decade.In this paper we describe isolation of a bacterium capable of degrading both isomers of the organochloride insecticide endosulfan and its toxic metabolite, endosulfate."
3714,The bacterium was isolated from a soil microbial population that was enriched with continuous pressure to use endosulfate as the sole source of sulfur.
3715,Analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence of the bacterium indicated that it was an Arthrobacter species.
3716,"The organochloride-degrading activity was not observed in the presence of sodium sulfite as an alternative sulfur source, suggesting that the activity was part of the sulfur starvation response of the strain."
3717,"A gene, ese, encoding an enzyme capable of degrading both isomers of endosulfan and endosulfate was isolated from this bacterium."
3718,The enzyme belongs to the two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase family whose members require reduced flavin for activity.
3719,Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses identified the metabolite of endosulfan as endosulfan monoalcohol and the metabolite of endosulfate as endosulfan hemisulfate.
3720,The ese gene was located in a cluster of 10 open reading frames encoding proteins with low levels of sulfur-containing amino acids.
3721,These open reading frames were organized into two apparent divergently orientated operons and a gene encoding a putative LysR-type transcriptional regulator.
3722,The operon not containing ese did contain a homologue whose product exhibited 62% amino acid identity to the ese-encoded protein.1.
3723,"An organism was isolated by enrichment culture that was capable of using thiophen-2-carboxylate as sole source of carbon, energy and sulphur for growth."
3724,2
3725,"Analysis of the cellular protein after growth of the organism on thiophen-2-carboxylate showed that only glutamate, proline and arginine were labelled."
3726,All the radioactivity in the glutamate was confined to C-1.
3727,3
3728,"In the presence of 2.1 mm-arsenite, suspensions of the organism converted thiophen-2-carboxylate into (14)C-labelled 2-oxoglutarate which had the same specific radioactivity as the starting material."
3729,4
3730,Cell-free extracts of the organism catalysed the release of (14)CO(2) from thiophen-2-carboxylate.
3731,This activity was largely dependent on the presence of ATP and CoA and was stimulated by NAD(+) and Mg(2+).
3732,"Inclusion of hydroxylamine resulted in the appearance of thiophen-2-carbohydroxamic acid, indicating that the ATP and CoA were involved in the formation of the CoA ester of thiophen-2-carboxylate."
3733,5
3734,High-speed centrifuging of cell-free extracts resulted in supernatants with decreased thiophen-2-carboxylate-degrading activity.
3735,Activity was restored by the addition of the high-speed pellet or by Methylene Blue.
3736,6
3737,The metabolism of the CoA ester of thiophen-2-carboxylate by cell-free extracts could be linked to the anaerobic reduction of Methylene Blue.
3738,7
3739,The sulphur atom of the thiophen nucleus was converted into sulphate by growing cultures and resting suspensions of the organism.
3740,8
3741,"A degradative pathway is proposed involving the hydroxylation (at C-5) of the CoA ester of thiophen-2-carboxylate followed by further metabolism to 2-oxoglutarate and sulphate.Intrastriatal injection of 3-nitrotyrosine, which is a biomarker for nitrating oxidants, provokes dopaminergic neuronal death in rats by unknown mechanisms."
3742,"Herein, we show that extracellular 3-nitrotyrosine is transported via the l-aromatic amino acid transporter in nondopaminergic NT2 cells, whereas in dopaminergic PC12 cells, it is transported by both the l-aromatic amino acid and the dopamine transporters."
3743,"In both cell lines, 3-nitrotyrosine is a substrate for tyrosine tubulin ligase, resulting in its incorporation into the C terminus of alpha-tubulin."
3744,"In NT2 cells, incorporation of 3-nitrotyrosine into alpha-tubulin induces a progressive, reversible reorganization of the microtubule architecture."
3745,"In PC12 cells, 3-nitrotyrosine decreases intracellular dopamine levels and is metabolized by the concerted action of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and monoamine oxidase."
3746,Intracellular levels of 133 micromol of 3-nitrotyrosine per mole of tyrosine did not alter NT2 viability but induced PC12 apoptosis.
3747,The cell death was reversed by caspases and aromatic amino acid decarboxylase and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
3748,"3-Nitrotyrosine induced loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive primary rat neurons, which was also prevented by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor."
3749,"These findings provide a novel mechanism by which products generated by reactive nitrogen species induce dopaminergic neuron death and thus may contribute to the selective neurodegeneration in Parkinson\'s disease.Testosterone and structurally related anabolic steroids have been used to treat hypogonadism, muscle wasting, osteoporosis, male contraception, cancer cachexia, anemia, and hormone replacement therapy in aging men or age-related frailty; while antiandrogens may be useful for treatment of conditions like acne, alopecia (male-pattern baldness), hirsutism, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer."
3750,"However, the undesirable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of steroidal androgen receptor (AR) ligands limited their clinical use."
3751,Nonsteroidal AR ligands with improved pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties have been developed to overcome these problems.
3752,"This review focuses on the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and pharmacology of clinically used and emerging nonsteroidal AR ligands, including antagonists, agonists, and selective androgen receptor modulators.Sphingomonas sp."
3753,strain A4 is capable of utilizing acenaphthene as its sole carbon and energy source.
3754,"To isolate the genes responsible for acenaphthene degradation, transposon mutagenesis was performed on strain A4 and four mini-Tn5-inserted mutants lacking the ability to utilize acenaphthene were isolated."
3755,"In three of the four mini-Tn5 inserted mutants, the mini-Tn5s were inserted into the same locus (within about 16 kb) as the arhA1A2 genes, which had previously been identified as the genes encoding the terminal oxygenase components for the initial oxygenation of acenaphthene."
3756,The nucleotide sequence analysis of the corresponding 16.4 kb DNA fragment revealed the existence of 16 ORFs and a partial ORF.
3757,"From these ORFs, the genes encoding the ferredoxin (ArhA3) and ferredoxin reductase (ArhA4) complementary to ArhA1A2 were identified."
3758,"RT-PCR analysis suggested that a 13.5 kb gene cluster, consisting of 13 ORFs and including all the arhA genes, forms an operon, although it includes several ORFs that are apparently unnecessary for acenaphthene degradation."
3759,"Furthermore, using gene disruption and quantitative RT-PCR analyses, the LysR-type activator, ArhR, required for expression of the 13.5 kb gene cluster was also identified."
3760,"Transcription of the gene cluster by ArhR was induced in the presence of acenaphthene (or its metabolite), and a putative binding site (T-N11-A motif) for ArhR was found upstream from the transcription start point of arhA3.The increasing worldwide contamination of freshwater systems with thousands of industrial and natural chemical compounds is one of the key environmental problems facing humanity."
3761,"Although most of these compounds are present at low concentrations, many of them raise considerable toxicological concerns, particularly when present as components of complex mixtures."
3762,Here we review three scientific challenges in addressing water-quality problems caused by such micropollutants.
3763,"First, tools to assess the impact of these pollutants on aquatic life and human health must be further developed and refined."
3764,"Second, cost-effective and appropriate remediation and water-treatment technologies must be explored and implemented."
3765,"Third, usage and disposal strategies, coupled with the search for environmentally more benign products and processes, should aim to minimize introduction of critical pollutants into the aquatic environment.Iminodisuccinate (IDS) epimerase catalyzes the epimerisation of R,R-, S,S- and R,S- iminodisuccinate, one step in the biodegradation of the chelating agent iminodisuccinate by Agrobacterium tumefaciens BY6."
3766,"The enzyme is a member of the MmgE/PrpD protein family, a diverse and little characterized class of proteins of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin."
3767,IDS epimerase does not show significant overall amino acid sequence similarity to any other protein of known three-dimensional structure.
3768,The crystal structure of this novel epimerase has been determined by multi-wavelength diffraction to 1.5 A resolution using selenomethionine-substituted enzyme.
3769,"In the crystal, the enzyme forms a homo-dimer, and the subunit consists of two domains."
3770,"The larger domain, not consecutive in sequence and comprising residues Met1-Lys266 and Leu400-Pro446, forms a novel all alpha-helical fold with a central six-helical bundle."
3771,"The second, smaller domain folds into an alpha+beta domain, related in topology to chorismate mutase by a circular permutation."
3772,IDS epimerase is thus not related in three-dimensional structure to other known epimerases.
3773,The fold of the IDS epimerase is representative for the whole MmgE/PrpD family.
3774,"The putative active site is located at the interface between the two domains of the subunit, and is characterized by a positively charged surface, consistent with the binding of a highly negatively charged substrate such as iminodisuccinate."
3775,Docking experiments suggest a two-base mechanism for the epimerisation reaction.N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a potent carcinogen and an emerging contaminant in groundwater and drinking water.
3776,"The metabolism of NDMA in mammalian cells has been widely studied, but little information is available concerning the microbial transformation of this compound."
3777,"The objective of this study was to elucidate the pathway(s) of NDMA biotransformation by Pseudomonas mendocina KR1, a strain that possesses toluene-4-monooxygenase (T4MO)."
3778,"P. mendocina KR1 was observed to initially oxidize NDMA to N-nitrodimethylamine (NTDMA), a novel metabolite."
3779,The use of 18O2 and H(2)18O revealed that the oxygen added to NDMA to produce NTDMA was derived from atmospheric O2.
3780,Experiments performed with a pseudomonad expressing cloned T4MO confirmed that T4MO catalyzes this initial reaction.
3781,"The NTDMA produced by P. mendocina KR1 did not accumulate, but rather it was metabolized further to produce N-nitromethylamine (88 to 94% recovery) and a trace amount of formaldehyde (HCHO)."
3782,Small quantities of methanol (CH3OH) were also detected when the strain was incubated with NDMA but not during incubation with either NTDMA or HCHO.
3783,"The formation of methanol is hypothesized to occur via a second, minor pathway mediated by an initial alpha-hydroxylation of the nitrosamine."
3784,"Strain KR1 did not grow on NDMA or mineralize significant quantities of the compound to carbon dioxide, suggesting that the degradation process is cometabolic.The acenaphthylene-degrading bacterium Rhizobium sp."
3785,strain CU-A1 was isolated from petroleum-contaminated soil in Thailand.
3786,This strain was able to degrade 600 mg/liter acenaphthylene completely within three days.
3787,"To elucidate the pathway for degradation of acenaphthylene, strain CU-A1 was mutagenized by transposon Tn5 in order to obtain mutant strains deficient in acenaphthylene degradation."
3788,"Metabolites produced from Tn5-induced mutant strains B1, B5, and A53 were purified by thin-layer chromatography and silica gel column chromatography and characterized by mass spectrometry."
3789,"The results suggested that this strain cleaved the fused five-membered ring of acenaphthylene to form naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid via acenaphthenequinone."
3790,"One carboxyl group of naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid was removed to form 1-naphthoic acid which was transformed into salicylic acid before metabolization to gentisic acid."
3791,"This work is the first report of complete acenaphthylene degradation by a bacterial strain.Iron (Fe) has long been a recognized physiological requirement for life, yet for many microorganisms that persist in water, soils and sediments, its role extends well beyond that of a nutritional necessity."
3792,Fe(II) can function as an electron source for iron-oxidizing microorganisms under both oxic and anoxic conditions and Fe(III) can function as a terminal electron acceptor under anoxic conditions for iron-reducing microorganisms.
3793,"Given that iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth\'s crust, iron redox reactions have the potential to support substantial microbial populations in soil and sedimentary environments."
3794,"As such, biological iron apportionment has been described as one of the most ancient forms of microbial metabolism on Earth, and as a conceivable extraterrestrial metabolism on other iron-mineral-rich planets such as Mars."
3795,"Furthermore, the metabolic versatility of the microorganisms involved in these reactions has resulted in the development of biotechnological applications to remediate contaminated environments and harvest energy.Information on bacterial thioamide metabolism has focused on transformation of the antituberculosis drug ethionamide and related compounds by Mycobacterium tuberculosis."
3796,"To study this metabolism more generally, a bacterium that grew using thioacetamide as the sole nitrogen source was isolated via enrichment culture."
3797,The bacterium was identified as Ralstonia pickettii and designated strain TA.
3798,Cells grown on thioacetamide also transformed other thioamide compounds.
3799,Transformation of the thioamides tested was dependent on oxygen.
3800,"During thioamide degradation, sulfur was detected in the medium at the oxidation level of sulfite, further suggesting an oxygenase mechanism."
3801,"R. pickettii TA did not grow on thiobenzamide as a nitrogen source, but resting cells converted thiobenzamide to benzamide, with thiobenzamide S-oxide and benzonitrile detected as intermediates."
3802,"Thioacetamide S-oxide was detected as an intermediate during thioacetamide degradation, but the only accumulating metabolite of thioacetamide was identified as 3,5-dimethyl-1,2,4-thiadiazole, a compound shown to derive from spontaneous reaction of thioacetamide and oxygenated thioacetamide species."
3803,This dead-end metabolite accounted for only ca.
3804,12% of the metabolized thioacetamide.
3805,"Neither acetonitrile nor acetamide was detected during thioacetamide degradation, but R. pickettii grew on both compounds as nitrogen and carbon sources."
3806,"It is proposed that R. pickettii TA degrades thioamides via a mechanism involving consecutive oxygenations of the thioamide sulfur atom.Catabolism of caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) in microorganisms commences via two possible mechanisms: demethylation and oxidation."
3807,"Through the demethylation route, the major metabolite formed in fungi is theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine), whereas theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine) is the major metabolite in bacteria."
3808,"In certain bacterial species, caffeine has also been oxidized directly to trimethyl uric acid in a single step."
3809,"The conversion of caffeine to its metabolites is primarily brought about by N-demethylases (such as caffeine demethylase, theobromine demethylase and heteroxanthinedemethylase), caffeine oxidase and xanthine oxidase that are produced by several caffeine-degrading bacterial species such as Pseudomonas putida and species within the genera Alcaligenes, Rhodococcus and Klebsiella."
3810,"Development of biodecaffeination techniques using these enzymes or using whole cells offers an attractive alternative to the present existing chemical and physical methods removal of caffeine, which are costly, toxic and non-specific to caffeine."
3811,"This review mainly focuses on the biochemistry of microbial caffeine degradation, presenting recent advances and the potential biotechnological application of caffeine-degrading enzymes.Understanding the fate of a pesticide in soil is fundamental to the accurate assessment of its environmental behaviour and vital in ensuring the safe use of new and existing products."
3812,Ionisable pesticides comprise a significant proportion of both existing and new active substances registered for use in agriculture worldwide.
3813,This group of pesticides includes chemicals that are frequently found in groundwater and surface waters in many different countries.
3814,"Despite this, approaches to predict the influence of soil properties on the behaviour of ionisable pesticides in soils are poorly developed."
3815,"Current regulatory assessments frequently default to methods developed for nonionic chemicals, although it is evident that ionisable compounds do not often react like neutral molecules."
3816,This review presents the state of knowledge on the adsorption of ionisable pesticides in soils.
3817,It first introduces the issues concerning adsorption and the characteristics of this particular kind of chemical.
3818,"The mechanisms postulated for the adsorption of ionisable pesticides are then described: these are hydrophobic partitioning, ionic exchange, charge transfer, ligand exchange, cation or water bridging, and the formation of bound residues."
3819,"Relatively little experimental evidence is available, and we are still unable to determine the quantitative contribution of each process in a particular situation."
3820,Knowledge is still lacking concerning phenomena occurring at the surfaces of soil particles.
3821,"Measurements do not allow determination of the operative pH at the surface of soil particles or in microenvironments, and the influence of ionic strength or competition effects is difficult to assess."
3822,"Subsequently, the review focuses on the influence of soil properties on adsorption and on potential to predict the behaviour of ionisable pesticides in soils."
3823,"Unlike hydrophobic compounds, adsorption of ionisable pesticides is highly sensitive to variation in pH."
3824,This relationship mainly derives from the different proportion of ionic and neutral forms of the pesticide present at each pH level but also from the presence of surfaces with pH-dependent charges in soils.
3825,"Soil organic matter generally promotes adsorption, although a negative influence has sometimes been reported."
3826,Clay and oxides can also play a significant role in some cases.
3827,"So far, no modelling approach has been applied successfully to a range of ionisable pesticides to predict their adsorption in soils."
3828,The standardization of experimental settings and the application of approaches specific to a particular class of pesticide or different type of soil might be necessary to describe the complexity of interactions among ionisable molecules.
3829,"Degradation of ionisable pesticides is influenced by soil pH in a particular way that relates to changes in sorption, changes in composition and activity of the microbial community, and to shifts in the balance between different degradative mechanisms.Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 was the first bacterium isolated by virtue of its ability to metabolize the high-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pyrene."
3830,"We used metabolic, genomic, and proteomic approaches in this investigation to construct a complete and integrated pyrene degradation pathway for M. vanbaalenii PYR-1."
3831,Genome sequence analyses identified genes involved in the pyrene degradation pathway that we have proposed for this bacterium.
3832,"To identify proteins involved in the degradation, we conducted a proteome analysis of cells exposed to pyrene using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry."
3833,"Database searching performed with the M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 genome resulted in identification of 1,028 proteins with a protein false discovery rate of <1%."
3834,"Based on both genomic and proteomic data, we identified 27 enzymes necessary for constructing a complete pathway for pyrene degradation."
3835,Our analyses indicate that this bacterium degrades pyrene to central intermediates through o-phthalate and the beta-ketoadipate pathway.
3836,"Proteomic analysis also revealed that 18 enzymes in the pathway were upregulated more than twofold, as indicated by peptide counting when the organism was grown with pyrene; three copies of the terminal subunits of ring-hydroxylating oxygenase (NidAB2, MvanDraft_0817/0818, and PhtAaAb), dihydrodiol dehydrogenase (MvanDraft_0815), and ring cleavage dioxygenase (MvanDraft_3242) were detected only in pyrene-grown cells."
3837,"The results presented here provide a comprehensive picture of pyrene metabolism in M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 and a useful framework for understanding cellular processes involved in PAH degradation.Endosulfan, an endocrine disrupting chemical, is a widely used cyclodiene organochlorine pesticide worldwide, and it blocks neuronal GABA(A)-gated chloride channels in mammals and aquatic organisms."
3838,"Endosulfan and its metabolites, such as endosulfan sulfate, are persistent in environments and are considered as toxic chemicals."
3839,"For bioremediation of endosulfan, in this study, an attempt was made to isolate an endosulfan and endosulfan sulfate degrading bacterium from endosulfan-polluted agricultural soil."
3840,"Through repetitive enrichment and successive subculture using endosulfan or endosulfan sulfate as the sole carbon source, a bacterium KS-2P was isolated."
3841,The KS-2P was identified as Pseudomonas sp.
3842,on the basis of the results of a 16S rDNA sequencing analysis and MIDI test.
3843,"The degradation ratios for endosulfan or endosulfan sulfate in minimal medium containing endosulfan (23.5 microg mL(-1)) or endosulfan sulfate (21 microg mL(-1)) were 52% and 71%, respectively."
3844,Our results suggest that Pseudomonas sp.
3845,KS-2P has potential as a biocatalyst for endosulfan bioremediation.Organophosphorus (OP) xenobiotics are used worldwide as pesticides and petroleum additives.
3846,OP compounds share the major portion of the pesticide market globally.
3847,"Owing to large-scale use of OP compounds, contaminations of soil and water systems have been reported from all parts of the world."
3848,OP compounds possess very high mammalian toxicity and therefore early detection and subsequent decontamination and detoxification of the polluted environment is essential.
3849,"Additionally, about 200,000 tons of extremely toxic OP chemical warfare agents are required to be destroyed by 2007 under Chemical Warfare Convention (1993)."
3850,"Chemical and physical methods of decontamination are not only expensive and time-consuming, but also in most cases they do not provide a complete solution."
3851,"These approaches convert compounds from toxic into less toxic states, which in some cases can accumulate in the environment and still be toxic to a range of organisms."
3852,"Bioremediation provides a suitable way to remove contaminants from the environment as, in most of the cases, OP compounds are totally mineralized by the microorganisms."
3853,Most OP compounds are degraded by microorganisms in the environment as a source of phosphorus or carbon or both.
3854,"Several soil bacteria have been isolated and characterized, which can degrade OP compounds in laboratory cultures and in the field."
3855,The biochemical and genetic basis of microbial degradation has received considerable attention.
3856,"Several genes/enzymes, which provide microorganisms with the ability to degrade OP compounds, have been identified and characterized."
3857,Some of these genes and enzymes have been engineered for better efficacy.
3858,Bacteria capable of complete mineralization are constructed by transferring the complete degradation pathway for specific compounds to one bacterium.
3859,"In the present article, we review microbial degradation and metabolic pathways for some OP compounds."
3860,The biochemical and molecular basis of OP degradation by microbes and the evolution and distribution of genes/enzymes are also reviewed.
3861,"This article also examines applications and future use of OP-degrading microbes and enzymes for bioremediation, treatment of OP poisoning, and as biosensors.The key role of telluric microorganisms in pesticide degradation is well recognized but the possible relationships between the biodiversity of soil microbial communities and their functions still remain poorly documented."
3862,"If microorganisms influence the fate of pesticides, pesticide application may reciprocally affect soil microorganisms."
3863,"The objective of our work was to estimate the impact of 2,4-D application on the genetic structure of bacterial communities and the 2,4-D-degrading genetic potential in relation to 2,4-D mineralization."
3864,Experiments combined isotope measurements with molecular analyses.
3865,"The impact of 2,4-D on soil bacterial populations was followed with ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis."
3866,"The 2,4-D degrading genetic potential was estimated by real-time PCR targeted on tfdA sequences coding an enzyme specifically involved in 2,4-D mineralization."
3867,"The genetic structure of bacterial communities was significantly modified in response to 2,4-D application, but only during the intense phase of 2,4-D biodegradation."
3868,This effect disappeared 7 days after the treatment.
3869,"The 2,4-D degrading genetic potential increased rapidly following 2,4-D application."
3870,There was a concomitant increase between the tfdA copy number and the 14C microbial biomass.
3871,"The maximum of tfdA sequences corresponded to the maximum rate of 2,4-D mineralization."
3872,"In this soil, 2,4-D degrading microbial communities seem preferentially to use the tfd pathway to degrade 2,4-D.Microbial mediated bioremediation has a great potential to effectively restore contaminated environment, but the lack of information about factors regulating the growth and metabolism of various microbial communities in polluted environment often limits its implementation."
3873,"Newly seeded techniques such as transcriptomics, proteomics and interactomics offer remarkable promise as tools to address longstanding questions regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of mineralization pathways."
3874,"During mineralization, transcript structures and their expression have been studied using high-throughput transcriptomic techniques with microarrays."
3875,"Generally however, transcripts have no ability to operate any physiological response; rather, they must be translated into proteins with significant functional impact."
3876,These proteins can be identified by proteomic techniques using powerful two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE).
3877,"Towards the establishment of functional proteomics, the current advances in mass spectrometry (MS) and protein microarrays play a central role in the proteomics approach."
3878,"Exploring the differential expression of a wide variety of proteins and screening of the entire genome for proteins that interact with particular mineralization regulatory factors would help us to gain insights into bioremediation.This is the first detailed study of metabolite production during degradation of the herbicide 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil)."
3879,"Degradation of dichlobenil and three potential metabolites: 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM), 2,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (2,6-DCBA) and ortho-chlorobenzamide (OBAM) was studied in soils either previously exposed or not exposed to dichlobenil using a newly developed HPLC method."
3880,"Dichlobenil was degraded in all four soils; BAM and 2,6-DCBA were only degraded in soils previously exposed to dichlobenil (100% within 35-56 days and 85-100% in 56 days, respectively), and OBAM in all four soils (25-33% removal in 48 days)."
3881,"BAM produced from dichlobenil was either hydrolyzed to 2,6-DCBA or dechlorinated to OBAM, which was further hydrolyzed to ortho-chlorobenzoic acid."
3882,BAM was rapidly mineralized in previously exposed soils only.
3883,All potential metabolites and the finding that BAM was a dead-end metabolite of dichlobenil in soils not previously exposed to dichlobenil needs to be included in risk assessments of the use of dichlobenil.Extensive applications of persistent organochlorine pesticides like endosulfan on cotton have led to the contamination of soil and water environments at several sites in Pakistan.
3884,Microbial degradation offers an effective approach to remove such toxicants from the environment.
3885,This study reports the isolation of highly efficient endosulfan degrading bacterial strains from soil.
3886,A total of 29 bacterial strains were isolated through enrichment technique from 15 specific sites using endosulfan as sole sulfur source.
3887,The strains differed substantially in their potential to degrade endosulfan in vitro ranging from 40 to 93% of the spiked amount (100 mg l(-1)).
3888,"During the initial 3 days of incubation, there was very little degradation but it got accelerated as the incubation period proceeded."
3889,Biodegradation of endosulfan by these bacteria also resulted in substantial decrease in pH of the broth from 8.2 to 3.7 within 14 days of incubation.
3890,The utilization of endosulfan was accompanied by increased optical densities (OD(595)) of the broth ranging from 0.511 to 0.890.
3891,"High performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed that endosulfan diol and endosulfan ether were among the products of endosulfan metabolism by these bacterial strains while endosulfan sulfate, a persistent and toxic metabolite of endosulfan, was not detected in any case."
3892,The presence of endosulfan diol and endosulfan ether in the bacterial metabolites was further confirmed by GC-MS. Abiotic degradation contributed up to 21% of the spiked amount.
3893,"The three bacterial strains, Pseudomonas spinosa, P. aeruginosa, and Burkholderia cepacia, were the most efficient degraders of both alpha- and beta-endosulfan as they consumed more than 90% of the spiked amount (100 mg l(-1)) in the broth within 14 days of incubation."
3894,"Maximum biodegradation by these three selected efficient bacterial strains was observed at an initial pH of 8.0 and at an incubation temperature of 30 degrees C. The results of this study may imply that these bacterial strains could be employed for bioremediation of endosulfan polluted soil and water environments.Two bacterial strains Klebsiella oxytoca Sc and Methylobacterium mesophilicum Sr were isolated and identified from enrichment cultures using dimethyl isophthalate (DMI) as the sole source of carbon and energy, and mangrove sediment as an inoculum."
3895,"DMI was rapidly transformed by K. oxytoca Sc in the culture with formation of monomethyl isophthalate (MMI), which accumulated in the culture medium."
3896,"M. mesophilicum Sr, incapable of utilizing DMI, showed high capability of degrading MMI to a transitory intermediate isophthalic acid (IPA), which was further mineralized by this strain."
3897,"The biochemical pathway of DMI degradation by these two bacteria in a consortium was proposed: DMI to MMI by K. oxytoca Sc, MMI to IPA by M. mesophilicum Sr, and IPA by both K. oxytoca Sc and M. mesophilicum Sr based on the identified degradation intermediates."
3898,The consortium comprising K. oxytoca Sc and M. mesophilicum Sr was effective in mineralization of DMI.
3899,"The results suggest that complete degradation of environmental pollutant DMI requires the biochemical cooperation between different microorganisms of the mangrove environment.In the present study, degradation of endosulfan by a mixed culture isolated from a pesticide-contaminated soil was studied in batch experiments."
3900,"After two weeks of incubation, the mixed culture was able to degrade 73% and 81% of alpha and beta endosulfan respectively."
3901,Endodiol was identified by GC/MS as degradation intermediate.
3902,The toxicity studies of endosulfan before and after degradation were carried out using micronucleus assay on human polymorphonuclear cells.
3903,The findings suggested that the metabolism of endosulfan isomers by the mixed culture was accompanied by significant reduction in the toxicity.
3904,Studies were also carried out to quantify the degradation potential of the individual species in the mixed bacterial culture.
3905,Two cultures identified by 16S rRNA as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Rhodococcus erythropolis were found to be responsible for majority of the degradation by the mixed culture.
3906,S. maltophilia showed better degradation efficiency compared to that by R. erythropolis.
3907,This is the first report of endosulfan degradation using the above-mentioned organisms.One strain of beta-Proteobacteria that could utilize Methyl tert-Butyl Ether (MTBE) as sole carbon and energy resource was used for MTBE degradation in closed system.
3908,"The culture conditions showed significant effect on the MTBE degradation and the optimum conditions were as following: original pH 7.2, initial cell concentration 10(7) cells/mL and initial MTBE concentration 25 mg/L."
3909,The effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) in medium of closed culture system on MTBE degradation was evaluated.
3910,It was found that supplication of oxygen into the closed system could significantly promote MTBE degradation.
3911,"The analysis of intermediate metabolites of MTBE degradation by GC-MS showed that tert-butyl alcohol, isopropanol and acetone were the main intermediate metabolites."
3912,"The concentration change of metabolites during the whole period of MTBE degradation suggested that the metabolic pathway of MTBE degradation was similar to the ""acetone pathway"".Pseudomonas putida DTB grew aerobically with N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) as a sole carbon source, initially breaking it down into 3-methylbenzoate and diethylamine."
3913,The former was further metabolized via 3-methylcatechol and meta ring cleavage.
3914,"A gene from DTB, dthA, was heterologously expressed and shown to encode the ability to hydrolyze DEET into 3-methylbenzoate and diethylamine.The nucleotide sequence of the linear catabolic plasmid pAL1 from the 2-methylquinoline (quinaldine)-degrading strain Arthrobacter nitroguajacolicus R\xc3\xbc61a comprises 112,992 bp."
3915,"A total of 103 open reading frames (ORFs) were identified on pAL1, 49 of which had no annotatable function."
3916,"The ORFs were assigned to the following functional groups: (i) catabolism of quinaldine and anthranilate, (ii) conjugation, and (iii) plasmid maintenance and DNA replication and repair."
3917,"The genes for conversion of quinaldine to anthranilate are organized in two operons that include ORFs presumed to code for proteins involved in assembly of the quinaldine-4-oxidase holoenzyme, namely, a MobA-like putative molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide synthase and an XdhC-like protein that could be required for insertion of the molybdenum cofactor."
3918,Genes possibly coding for enzymes involved in anthranilate degradation via 2-aminobenzoyl coenzyme A form another operon.
3919,These operons were expressed when cells were grown on quinaldine or on aromatic compounds downstream in the catabolic pathway.
3920,"Single-stranded 3\' overhangs of putative replication intermediates of pAL1 were predicted to form elaborate secondary structures due to palindromic and superpalindromic terminal sequences; however, the two telomeres appear to form different structures."
3921,"Sequence analysis of ORFs 101 to 103 suggested that pAL1 codes for one or two putative terminal proteins, presumed to be covalently bound to the 5\' termini, and a multidomain telomere-associated protein (Tap) comprising 1,707 amino acids."
3922,"Even if the putative proteins encoded by ORFs 101 to 103 share motifs with the Tap and terminal proteins involved in telomere patching of Streptomyces linear replicons, their overall sequences and domain structures differ significantly.Recently we showed that degradation of several nonylphenol isomers with alpha-quaternary carbon atoms is initiated by ipso-hydroxylation in Sphingobium xenophagum Bayram (F. L. P. Gabriel, A. Heidlberger, D. Rentsch, W. Giger, K. Guenther, and H.-P. E. Kohler, J. Biol."
3923,Chem.
3924,"280:15526-15533, 2005)."
3925,"Here, we demonstrate with 18O-labeling experiments that the ipso-hydroxy group was derived from molecular oxygen and that, in the major pathway for cleavage of the alkyl moiety, the resulting nonanol metabolite contained an oxygen atom originating from water and not from the ipso-hydroxy group, as was previously assumed."
3926,"Our results clearly show that the alkyl cation derived from the alpha-quaternary nonylphenol 4-(1-ethyl-1,4-dimethyl-pentyl)-phenol through ipso-hydroxylation and subsequent dissociation of the 4-alkyl-4-hydroxy-cyclohexadienone intermediate preferentially combines with a molecule of water to yield the corresponding alcohol and hydroquinone."
3927,"However, the metabolism of certain alpha,alpha-dimethyl-substituted nonylphenols appears to also involve a reaction of the cation with the ipso-hydroxy group to form the corresponding 4-alkoxyphenols."
3928,"Growth, oxygen uptake, and 18O-labeling experiments clearly indicate that strain Bayram metabolized 4-t-butoxyphenol by ipso-hydroxylation to a hemiketal followed by spontaneous dissociation to the corresponding alcohol and p-quinone."
3929,Hydroquinone effected high oxygen uptake in assays with induced resting cells as well as in assays with cell extracts.
3930,This further corroborates the role of hydroquinone as the ring cleavage intermediate during degradation of 4-nonylphenols and 4-alkoxyphenols.The phenol-degrading strain Trichosporon cutaneum R57 utilizes various aromatic and aliphatic compounds as a sole carbon and energy source.
3931,The intracellular activities of phenol hydroxylase  of a Trichosporon cutaneum R57 strain grown on phenol (0.5 g/l) were measured.
3932,"Different toxic phenol derivatives (cresols, nitrophenols and hydroxyphenols) were used as substrates in the reaction mixture for determination of the enzyme activity."
3933,The data obtained showed that the investigated enzyme was capable to hydroxylate all applied aromatic substrates.
3934,The measured activities of phenol hydroxylase varied significantly depending on the aromatic compounds used as substrates.
3935,The rate of phenol hydroxylase activity with phenol as a substrate (1.0 U/mg total cell protein) was accepted as 100%.A gram-negative Novosphingobium sp.
3936,strain FND-3 capable of degrading carbofuran was isolated and characterized.
3937,The carbofuran-degrading ability of strain FND-3 was investigated under various culture conditions.
3938,Strain FND-3 showed a high average carbofuran-degrading rate of 28.6 mg L(-1) h(-1) in mineral salts medium with 100 mg L(-1) carbofuran.
3939,GC/MS analysis pointed out the presence of several unknown metabolites.
3940,One hydrolyzate was identified as 2-hydroxy-3-(3-methypropan-2-ol) phenol via hydrolysis of carbofuran phenol.
3941,The appearance of another metabolite with M(+) of 180 m/z indicated that the hydroxylation of carbofuran occurred at the aromatic ring.
3942,One novel degrading product with M(+) of 239 m/z was identified as 2-hydroxy-3-(3-methylpropan-2-ol) benzene-N-methylcarbamate via hydrolyzing at the ether bond of furanyl ring of carbofuran.
3943,Strain FND-3 was also able to degrade other N-methylcarbamate pesticides.Dimethyl phthalate esters (DMPE) can easily be released into the environment from plastic products.
3944,"As endocrine disruptors, DMPE mimic estrogenic activities in animals and humans."
3945,The metabolites of DMPE are suspected to cause even more serious health problems.
3946,"Among the common sterilization techniques adopted in the study of DMPE degradation, the average loss of the parent DMPE compounds after autoclaving was as high as 21.26%."
3947,"In contrast, the loss after 0.2 microm filtration was significantly lower at 2.28%."
3948,It is suggested that filtration should be used over autoclaving for sterilizing DMPE.
3949,The environmental fate of DMPE under sulfate-reducing condition was simulated and studied in microcosm system.
3950,"It was observed that dimethyl phthalate (DMP), dimethyl isophthalate (DMI) and dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) could not be mineralized over an extended period of 6 months, but with the transformation to the respective monomethyl phthalate and/or phthalic acid."
3951,"The dominant species of microorganisms utilizing individual DMPE isomer as the sole carbon source were isolated and identified as facultative anaerobe Thauera sp., Xanthobacter sp."
3952,and Agrobacterium sp.
3953,"for DMP, DMI and DMT, respectively."
3954,This study illustrates that the detrimental DMPE and their natural metabolites may accumulate in the sulfate-reducing environment.
3955,"Accordingly, proper surveillance program should be devised to monitor both the parent compounds and degradation intermediates of DMPE in order to protect the aquatic ecosystem and human health.Nicotine and some related alkaloids in tobacco and tobacco wastes are harmful to health and the environment, and a major environmental requirement is to remove them from tobacco and tobacco wastes."
3956,"In this study, an isolated strain, S16, identified as Pseudomonas putida biotype A, was used to investigate nicotine degradation."
3957,"Possible intermediates were identified based on the results of NMR, Fourier-transform (FT)-IR and UV spectroscopy, GC-MS and high-resolution MS (HR-MS) analysis."
3958,"The pathway of nicotine degradation in P. putida was proposed to be from nicotine to 2,5-dihydroxypyridine through the intermediates N-methylmyosmine, 2\'-hydroxynicotine, pseudooxynicotine, 3-pyridinebutanal,C-oxo, 3-succinoylpyridine and 6-hydroxy-3-succinoylpyridine."
3959,"N-Methylmyosmine, 2,5-dihydroxypyridine and succinic acid were detected and satisfactorily verified for the first time as intermediates of nicotine degradation."
3960,"In addition, an alcohol compound, 1-butanone,4-hydroxy-1-(3-pyridinyl), was found to be a novel product of nicotine degradation."
3961,These findings provide new insights into the microbial metabolism of nicotine and the environmentally friendly route of nicotine degradation.The nucleotide sequence of a new plasmid pCNB1 from Comamonas sp.
3962,strain CNB-1 that degrades 4-chloronitrobenzene (4CNB) was determined.
3963,"pCNB1 belongs to the IncP-1beta group and is 91,181 bp in length."
3964,"A total of 95 open reading frames appear to be involved in (i) the replication, maintenance, and transfer of pCNB1; (ii) resistance to arsenate and chromate; and (iii) the degradation of 4CNB."
3965,"The 4CNB degradative genes and arsenate resistance genes were located on an extraordinarily large transposon (44.5 kb), proposed as TnCNB1."
3966,TnCNB1 was flanked by two IS1071 elements and represents a new member of the composite I transposon family.
3967,The 4CNB degradative genes within TnCNB1 were separated by various truncated genes and genetic homologs from other DNA molecules.
3968,Genes for chromate resistance were located on another transposon that was similar to the Tn21 transposon of the class II replicative family that is frequently responsible for the mobilization of mercury resistance genes.
3969,"Resistance to arsenate and chromate were experimentally confirmed, and transcriptions of arsenate and chromate resistance genes were demonstrated by reverse transcription-PCR."
3970,"These results described a new member of the IncP-1beta plasmid family, and the findings suggest that gene deletion and acquisition as well as genetic rearrangement of DNA molecules happened during the evolution of the 4CNB degradation pathway on pCNB1.With the ready availability of georeferenced environmental data, regional and global chemical fate models have become increasingly spatially explicit."
3971,"However, the description of how chemical fate properties such as degradation rate constants and partition coefficients depend on environmental conditions has not kept up with these developments."
3972,"Consequently, model results are often subject to large uncertainty stemming from inherent variability in these properties."
3973,"Here, we present an extensive meta-analysis of soil degradation of one exemplary compound, the herbicide atrazine."
3974,"In the first part of the paper, we present the results of an in-depth statistical analysis of the dependence of atrazine degradation rate constants on various environmental factors."
3975,"In the second part, the resulting estimation equation for atrazine degradation rate constants is implemented in CliMoChem, a model for the prediction of global chemical fate, which we supplemented with spatial information on various soil descriptors, such as temperature, sand and clay content, organic carbon content, and pH."
3976,"Estimates of polar accumulation, an important indicator of global chemical fate, were then compared between this model setup and estimates obtained when the degradation rate constant is represented by a single value or as being dependent on temperature only."
3977,"Results for the three rate estimation methods demonstrate that a spatially explicit description of the soil degradation process results in 4-fold higher estimates of polar accumulation, while reducing uncertainty in the prediction of this endpoint by more than 40%.The degradation of bisphenol A and nonylphenol involves the unusual rearrangement of stable carbon-carbon bonds."
3978,Some nonylphenol isomers and bisphenol A possess a quaternary alpha-carbon atom as a common structural feature.
3979,The degradation of nonylphenol in Sphingomonas sp.
3980,strain TTNP3 occurs via a type II ipso substitution with the presence of a quaternary alpha-carbon as a prerequisite.
3981,"We report here a new degradation pathway of bisphenol A. Consequent to the hydroxylation at position C-4, according to a type II ipso substitution mechanism, the C-C bond between the phenolic moiety and the isopropyl group of bisphenol A is broken."
3982,"Besides the formation of hydroquinone and 4-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)phenol as the main metabolites, further compounds resulting from molecular rearrangements consistent with a carbocationic intermediate were identified."
3983,Assays with resting cells or cell extracts of Sphingomonas sp.
3984,strain TTNP3 under an (18)O(2) atmosphere were performed.
3985,"One atom of (18)O(2) was present in hydroquinone, resulting from the monooxygenation of bisphenol A and nonylphenol."
3986,The monooxygenase activity was dependent on both NADPH and flavin adenine dinucleotide.
3987,Various cytochrome P450 inhibitors had identical inhibition effects on the conversion of both xenobiotics.
3988,Using a mutant of Sphingomonas sp.
3989,"strain TTNP3, which is defective for growth on nonylphenol, we demonstrated that the reaction is catalyzed by the same enzymatic system."
3990,"In conclusion, the degradation of bisphenol A and nonylphenol is initiated by the same monooxygenase, which may also lead to ipso substitution in other xenobiotics containing phenol with a quaternary alpha-carbon.Alcaligenes sp."
3991,"strain NyZ215 was isolated for its ability to grow on ortho-nitrophenol (ONP) as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy and was shown to degrade ONP via a catechol ortho-cleavage pathway."
3992,"A 10,152-bp DNA fragment extending from a conserved region of the catechol 1,2-dioxygenase gene was obtained by genome walking."
3993,"Of seven complete open reading frames deduced from this fragment, three (onpABC) have been shown to encode the enzymes involved in the initial reactions of ONP catabolism in this strain."
3994,"OnpA, which shares 26% identity with salicylate 1-monooxygenase of Pseudomonas stutzeri AN10, is an ONP 2-monooxygenase (EC 1.14.13.31) which converts ONP to catechol in the presence of NADPH, with concomitant nitrite release."
3995,"OnpC is a catechol 1,2-dioxygenase catalyzing the oxidation of catechol to cis,cis-muconic acid."
3996,OnpB exhibits 54% identity with the reductase subunit of vanillate O-demethylase in Pseudomonas fluorescens BF13.
3997,OnpAB (but not OnpA alone) conferred on the catechol utilizer Pseudomonas putida PaW340 the ability to grow on ONP.
3998,This suggests that OnpB may also be involved in ONP degradation in vivo as an o-benzoquinone reductase converting o-benzoquinone to catechol.
3999,"This is analogous to the reduction of tetrachlorobenzoquinone to tetrachlorohydroquinone by a tetrachlorobenzoquinone reductase (PcpD, 38% identity with OnpB) in the pentachlorophenol degrader Sphingobium chlorophenolicum ATCC 39723.The physiological function for thiaminase II, a thiamin-degrading enzyme, has eluded investigators for more than 50 years."
4000,"Here, we demonstrate that this enzyme is involved in the regeneration of the thiamin pyrimidine rather than in thiamin degradation, and we identify a new pathway involved in the salvage of base-degraded forms of thiamin."
4001,"This pathway is widely distributed among bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes."
4002,"In this pathway, thiamin hydrolysis products such as N-formyl-4-amino-5-aminomethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (formylaminopyrimidine; 15) are transported into the cell using the ThiXYZ transport system, deformylated by the ylmB-encoded amidohydrolase and hydrolyzed to 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine (HMP; 6)-an intermediate on the de novo thiamin biosynthetic pathway."
4003,To our knowledge this is the first example of a thiamin salvage pathway involving thiamin analogs generated by degradation of one of the heterocyclic rings of the cofactor.Thermal cleavage processes of N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide monohydrate (NMMO) were observed in pure NMMO as well as in cellulose/NMMO solutions by ESR at temperatures of the industrial Lyocell process ( approximately 370K).
4004,Generated radicals were attributed to the alkylnitroxyl type radicals -CH(2)-NO-CH(3) in NMMO and additional (and dominated) -CH(2)-NO-CH(2)- in cellulose/NMMO solutions.
4005,"Formation of both radical types formed due to NMMO ring scission is suggested.Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are common flame-retardant chemicals that are used in diverse commercial products such as textiles, circuit boards, and plastics."
4006,"Because of the widespread production and improper disposal of materials that contain PBDEs, there has been an increasing accumulation of these compounds in the environment."
4007,"The toxicity and bioavailability of PBDEs are variable for different congeners, with some congeners showing dioxin-like activities and estrogenicity."
4008,The diphenyl ether-utilizing bacterium Sphingomonas sp.
4009,PH-07 was enriched from activated sludge of a wastewater treatment plant.
4010,"In liquid cultures, this strain mineralized 1 g of diphenyl ether per liter completely within 6 days."
4011,The metabolites detected and identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (MS) and electrospray ionization/MS analysis corresponded with a feasible degradative pathway.
4012,"However, the strain PH-07 even catabolized several brominated congeners such as mono-, di-, and tribrominated diphenyl ethers thereby producing the corresponding metabolites.Sphingobium xenophagum Bayram is capable of metabolizing 4-alkoxyphenols and endocrine disruptive alpha-quaternary 4-nonylphenols by an ipso-substitution mechanism that involves ring hydroxylation at the site of the substituent."
4013,"Here, we show that Bayram\'s ipso-hydroxylating activity was able to transform also bisphenol A (= dimethyl-4,4\'-methylenediphenol; BPA) and 4-isopropylphenol."
4014,We identified six metabolites when resting cells of strain Bayram were incubated with BPA.
4015,"They were unambiguously characterized by HPLC-UV, HPLC/MS, and HPLC/MS/MS as hydroquinone, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)isopropanol, 4-isopropenylphenol, 4-isopropylphenol, 4-hydroxy-4-isopropenylcyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one, and 4-hydroxy-4-isopropylcyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one."
4016,"In experiments with 4-isopropylphenol as a substrate, 4-hydroxy-4-isopropylcyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one, one of the metabolites from BPA, accumulated to a high degree."
4017,We could rationalize the formation of all metabolites by invoking ipso-hydroxylation and ipso-substitution mechanisms.
4018,"On closer view, also classical bacterial metabolism of BPA can be well rationalized by an ipso-substitution mechanism, albeit with ipso-attack of an internal alkyl radical instead of an activated oxygen species."
4019,"This highlights the important role of ipso-substitution as a versatile degradative principle utilized by diverse organisms to degrade alpha-quaternary 4-nonylphenols, 4-alkoxyphenols, and BPA.Malathion is an organophosphate insecticide that has been widely used for both domestic and commercial agricultural purposes."
4020,"However, malathion has the potential to produce toxic effects in mammalian systems."
4021,"In this study, Pseudomonas aeruginosa AA 112 which was isolated from soil using enrichment technique could utilize the malathion as a sole carbon source and a source of energy."
4022,Pseudomonas aeruginosa AA112 was able to grow in MSMPY medium containing 42.75 mg/ml malathion.
4023,"However, the optimum concentration of malathion which supported the maximum bacterial growth was found to be 22."
4024,8 mg/ml.
4025,Malathion was used as an initial source of energy and carbon when it was found without additional carbon sources (in MSM medium) while it was utilized as second source of energy and carbon in a nutrient-supplemented medium (in MSMPY medium).
4026,"Moreover, lead acetate test indicated that malathion was first attacked at a sulphur site 1-2 hours after the start of incubation."
4027,"TLC and IR analysis indicated that malathion was completely degraded into diethyl succinate, hydrogen sulphide and phosphates."
4028,Therefore a malathion degradation pathway was proporsed.
4029,The degradation of malathion is attributed to the genes located on the chromosome and at least three proteins of high molecular size might be involved in malathion utilization.
4030,"Bacteria able to use malathion as a food source or metabolize its residues in the environment to inactive, less toxic, and harmless compounds, could be used in bioremediation of an environmental pollution caused by the pesticide.The benzonitriles dichlobenil, bromoxynil and ioxynil are important broad-spectrum or selective herbicides used in agriculture, orchards and public areas worldwide."
4031,"The dichlobenil metabolite 2,6-dichlorobenzamide is the most frequently encountered groundwater contaminant in Denmark, which suggests that the environmental fate of these three structurally related benzonitrile herbicides should be addressed in detail."
4032,"This review summarises the current knowledge on microbial degradation of dichlobenil, bromoxynil and ioxynil with particular focus on common features of degradation rates and pathways, accumulation of persistent metabolites and diversity of the involved degrader organisms.Three bacteria capable of utilizing bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methane (bisphenol F ) as the sole carbon source were isolated from river water, and they all belonged to the family Sphingomonadaceae."
4033,"One of the isolates, designated Sphingobium yanoikuyae strain FM-2, at an initial cell density of 0.01 (optical density at 600 nm) completely degraded 0.5 mM BPF within 9 h without any lag period under inductive conditions."
4034,Degradation assays of various bisphenols revealed that the BPF-metabolizing system of strain FM-2 was effective only on the limited range of bisphenols consisting of two phenolic rings joined together through a bridging carbon without any methyl substitution on the rings or on the bridging structure.
4035,A BPF biodegradation pathway was proposed on the basis of metabolite production patterns and identification of the metabolites.
4036,"The initial step of BPF biodegradation involves hydroxylation of the bridging carbon to form bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)methanol, followed by oxidation to 4,4\'-dihydroxybenzophenone."
4037,"The 4,4\'-dihydroxybenzophenone appears to be further oxidized by the Baeyer-Villiger reaction to 4-hydroxyphenyl 4-hydroxybenzoate, which is then cleaved by oxidation to form 4-hydroxybenzoate and 1,4-hydroquinone."
4038,"Both of the resultant simple aromatic compounds are mineralized.Microbial activities drive the global nitrogen cycle, and in the past few years, our understanding of nitrogen cycling processes and the micro-organisms that mediate them has changed dramatically."
4039,"During this time, the processes of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), and ammonia oxidation within the domain Archaea, have been recognized as two new links in the global nitrogen cycle."
4040,"All available evidence indicates that these processes and organisms are critically important in the environment, and particularly in the ocean."
4041,"Here we review what is currently known about the microbial ecology of anaerobic and archaeal ammonia oxidation, highlight relevant unknowns and discuss the implications of these discoveries for the global nitrogen and carbon cycles.1,4-dioxane is a probable human carcinogen and an emerging water contaminant."
4042,Monooxygenase-expressing bacteria have been shown to degrade dioxane via growth-supporting as well as cometabolic mechanisms.
4043,"In this study, the intermediates of dioxane degradation by monooxygenase-expressing bacteria were determined by triple quadrupole-mass spectrometry and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry."
4044,"The major intermediates were identified as 2-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid (HEAA), ethylene glycol, glycolate, and oxalate."
4045,"Studies with uniformly labeled 14C dioxane showed that over 50% of the dioxane was mineralized to CO2 by CB1190, while 5% became biomass-associated after 48 h. Volatile organic acids and non-volatiles, respectively, accounted for 20 and 11% of the radiolabeled carbon."
4046,"Although strains cometabolizing dioxane exhibited limited transformation capacities, nearly half of the initial dioxane was recovered as CO2."
4047,"On the basis of these analytical results, we propose a pathway for dioxane oxidation by monooxygenase-expressing cells in which dioxane is first converted to 2-hydroxy-1,4-dioxane, which is spontaneously oxidized to HEAA."
4048,"During a second monooxygenation step, HEAA is further hydroxylated, resulting in a mixture of dihydroxyethoxyacetic acids with a hydroxyl group at the ortho or para position."
4049,"After cleavage of the second ether bond, small organic molecules such as ethylene glycol, glycolate, glyoxalate, and oxalate are progressively formed, which are then mineralized to CO2 via common cellular metabolic pathways."
4050,Bioremediation of dioxane via this pathway is not expected to cause an accumulation of toxic compounds in the environment.DNA sequencing has become central to the study of evolution.
4051,"Comparing the sequences of individual genes from a variety of organisms has revolutionized our understanding of how single genes evolve, but the challenge of analyzing polygenic phenotypes has complicated efforts to study how genes evolve when they are part of a group that functions collectively."
4052,"We suggest that biosynthetic gene clusters from microbes are ideal candidates for the evolutionary study of gene collectives; these selfish genetic elements evolve rapidly, they usually comprise a complete pathway, and they have a phenotype-a small molecule-that is easy to identify and assay."
4053,"Because these elements are transferred horizontally as well as vertically, they also provide an opportunity to study the effects of horizontal transmission on gene evolution."
4054,We discuss known examples to begin addressing two fundamental questions about the evolution of biosynthetic gene clusters: How do they propagate by horizontal transfer?
4055,"How do they change to create new molecules?Photoallergic contact dermatitis from topical ketoprofen (KP), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, is a well-known side effect.The water in the canals and some recreational lakes in Amsterdam is microbiologically contaminated through the discharge of raw sewage from houseboats, sewage effluent, and dog and bird feces."
4056,Exposure to these waters may have negative health effects.
4057,"During two successive 1-year study periods, the water quality in two canals (2003 to 2004) and five recreational lakes (2004 to 2005) in Amsterdam was tested with regard to the presence of fecal indicators and waterborne pathogens."
4058,"According to Bathing Water Directive 2006/7/EC, based on Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococcus counts, water quality in the canals was poor but was classified as excellent in the recreational lakes."
4059,"Campylobacter, Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia were detected in the canals, as was rotavirus, norovirus, and enterovirus RNA."
4060,"Low numbers of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts were detected in the recreational lakes, despite compliance with European bathing water legislation."
4061,"The estimated risk of infection with Cryptosporidium and Giardia per exposure event ranged from 0.0002 to 0.007% and 0.04 to 0.2%, respectively, for occupational divers professionally exposed to canal water."
4062,"The estimated risk of infection at exposure to incidental peak concentrations of Cryptosporidium and Giardia may be up to 0.01% and 1%, respectively, for people who accidentally swallow larger volumes of the canal water than the divers."
4063,"Low levels of viable waterborne pathogens, such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia, pose a possible health risk from occupational, accidental, and recreational exposure to surface waters in Amsterdam.Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) bacteria, which were discovered in waste-water sludge in the early 1990s, have the unique metabolic ability to combine ammonium and nitrite or nitrate to form nitrogen gas."
4064,This discovery led to the realization that a substantial part of the enormous nitrogen losses that are observed in the marine environment--up to 50% of the total nitrogen turnover--were due to the activity of these bacteria.
4065,"In this Timeline, Gijs Kuenen recalls the discovery of these unique microorganisms and describes the continuing elucidation of their roles in environmental and industrial microbiology.Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 is well known for its ability to degrade a wide range of high-molecular-weight (HMW) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)."
4066,"The genome of this bacterium has recently been sequenced, allowing us to gain insights into the molecular basis for the degradation of PAHs."
4067,The 6.5 Mb genome of PYR-1 contains 194 chromosomally encoded genes likely associated with degradation of aromatic compounds.
4068,"The most distinctive feature of the genome is the presence of a 150 kb major catabolic region at positions 494 approximately 643 kb (region A), with an additional 31 kb region at positions 4,711 approximately 4,741 kb (region B), which is predicted to encode most enzymes for the degradation of PAHs."
4069,Region A has an atypical mosaic structure made of several gene clusters in which the genes for PAH degradation are complexly arranged and scattered around the clusters.
4070,Significant differences in the gene structure and organization as compared to other well-known aromatic hydrocarbon degraders including Pseudomonas and Burkholderia were revealed.
4071,"Many identified genes were enriched with multiple paralogs showing a remarkable range of diversity, which could contribute to the wide variety of PAHs degraded by M. vanbaalenii PYR-1."
4072,The PYR-1 genome also revealed the presence of 28 genes involved in the TCA cycle.
4073,"Based on the results, we proposed a pathway in which HMW PAHs are degraded into the beta-ketoadipate pathway through protocatechuate and then mineralized to CO2 via TCA cycle."
4074,"We also identified 67 and 23 genes involved in PAH degradation and TCA cycle pathways, respectively, to be expressed as proteins.Numerous studies have shown that a variety of manufactured and natural organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals, steroids, surfactants, flame retardants, fragrances, plasticizers and other chemicals often associated with wastewaters have been detected in the vicinity of municipal wastewater discharges and livestock agricultural facilities."
4075,To provide new data and insights about the environmental presence of some of these chemicals in untreated sources of drinking water in the United States targeted sites were sampled and analyzed for 100 analytes with sub-parts per billion detection capabilities.
4076,The sites included 25 ground- and 49 surface-water sources of drinking water serving populations ranging from one family to over 8 million people.
4077,Sixty-three of the 100 targeted chemicals were detected in at least one water sample.
4078,"Interestingly, in spite of the low detection levels 60% of the 36 pharmaceuticals (including prescription drugs and antibiotics) analyzed were not detected in any water sample."
4079,"The five most frequently detected chemicals targeted in surface water were: cholesterol (59%, natural sterol), metolachlor (53%, herbicide), cotinine (51%, nicotine metabolite), beta-sitosterol (37%, natural plant sterol), and 1,7-dimethylxanthine (27%, caffeine metabolite); and in ground water: tetrachloroethylene (24%, solvent), carbamazepine (20%, pharmaceutical), bisphenol-A (20%, plasticizer), 1,7-dimethylxanthine (16%, caffeine metabolite), and tri (2-chloroethyl) phosphate (12%, fire retardant)."
4080,A median of 4 compounds were detected per site indicating that the targeted chemicals generally occur in mixtures (commonly near detection levels) in the environment and likely originate from a variety of animal and human uses and waste sources.
4081,"These data will help prioritize and determine the need, if any, for future occurrence, fate and transport, and health-effects research for subsets of these chemicals and their degradates most likely to be found in water resources used for drinking water in the United States.The hitherto unstudied microbial degradation of the organic disulfide 3,3\'-dithiodipropionic acid (DTDP) was investigated with the recently described bacterium Tetrathiobacter mimigardefordensis strain DPN7(T) (DSM 17166(T); LMG 22922(T)), which is able to use DTDP as the sole carbon source for growth."
4082,3-Mercaptopropionic acid (3MP) and 3-sulfinopropionic acid (3SP) were detected in the growth medium and occurred as intermediates during DTDP degradation.
4083,"To identify genes coding for enzymes of DTDP catabolism, Tn5::mob-induced mutants of T. mimigardefordensis were generated."
4084,Screening of transposon mutant libraries yielded many mutants fully or partially impaired in utilizing DTDP as a carbon source.
4085,Mapping of the insertion loci in some mutants identified four disrupted open reading frames (ORFs) with putative metabolic functions.
4086,"The ORFs were assigned function on the basis of homologies with lpdA (EC 1.8.1.4), cdo (EC 1.13.11.20), sucCD (EC 6.2.1.5), and acnB (EC 4.2.1.3)."
4087,Tn5::mob insertions occurred additionally in the vicinity of heat shock protein-encoding genes.
4088,The predicted function of the LpdA homologue in T. mimigardefordensis is cleavage of the disulfide bond of DTDP to form two molecules of 3MP.
4089,"Cdo catalyzes the conversion of the sulfhydryl group of 3MP, yielding the corresponding sulfinic acid, 3SP."
4090,"SucCD exhibits thiokinase activity, ligating coenzyme A (CoA) with 3SP to form 3SP-CoA."
4091,"Afterwards, an elimination of sulfite via a putative desulfinase is expected."
4092,acnB encodes a putative 2-methylisocitrate dehydratase.
4093,"Therefore, a new pathway is proposed for the catabolism of DTDP via 3MP, 3SP, and 3SP-CoA toward propionyl-CoA, which is then further catabolized via the 2-methylcitric acid cycle in T. mimigardefordensis.In the Netherlands, many of the fresh groundwater resources are vulnerable to pollution."
4094,"Owing to high population densities and intensive farming practices, pesticide residues are found in groundwater at many places."
4095,"Hence a number of drinking water abstraction wells contain pesticides residues, causing considerable costs for purification."
4096,"The Water Framework Directive (WFD) requires countries to assess the chemical status of groundwater bodies and set up monitoring plans for groundwater quality, including pesticides."
4097,771 groundwater samples were taken from monitoring wells in 2006 and analysed for a broad list of pesticides in order to fulfil these requirements.
4098,"Pesticide were detected in 27% of samples, while in 11% the WFD limit of 0.1 microg/l was exceeded."
4099,"In this paper, these and earlier measurements are evaluated further, considering also measurements in drinking water wells, information about the origin of measured pesticides and calculated trends in use and emissions."
4100,"The measurements in the monitoring wells showed that where pesticides are used, 15-55% (minimal and maximal estimation) of the wells in shallow groundwater (1 to 20 m below soil surface) contain pesticides residues at concentrations above 0.1 microg/l."
4101,"When the metabolites BAM and AMPA are excluded (as not relevant in human toxicological terms), the estimation range is 7-37%."
4102,These patterns observed in shallow groundwater are reflected by the occurrence of pesticides in vulnerable abstraction wells that are used for the production of drinking water.
4103,The WFD requires the determination of both status and trends.
4104,The design of current monitoring network is evaluated from this perspective.
4105,"Several recommendations are made for more adequate and efficient monitoring.Three high volume septic systems in Ontario, Canada, were examined to assess the potential for onsite wastewatertreatment systems to release pharmaceutical compounds to the environment and to evaluate the mobility of these compounds in receiving aquifers."
4106,"Wastewater samples were collected from the septic tanks, and groundwater samples were collected below and down gradient of the infiltration beds and analyzed for a suite of commonly used pharmaceutical and trace organic compounds."
4107,The septic tank samples contained elevated concentrations of several pharmaceutical compounds.
4108,Ten of the 12 compounds analyzed were detected in groundwater at one or more sites at concentrations in the low ng L(-1) to low microg L(-1) range.
4109,Large differences among the sites were observed in both the number of detections and the concentrations of the pharmaceutical compounds.
4110,"Of the compounds analyzed, ibuprofen, gemfibrozil, and naproxen were observed to be transported atthe highest concentrations and greatest distances from the infiltration source areas, particularly in anoxic zones of the plumes.As part of the continuing effort to collect baseline information on the environmental occurrence of pharmaceuticals, and other organic wastewater contaminants (OWCs) in the Nation\'s water resources, water samples were collected from a network of 47 groundwater sites across 18 states in 2000."
4111,All samples collected were analyzed for 65 OWCs representing a wide variety of uses and origins.
4112,Site selection focused on areas suspected to be susceptible to contamination from either animal or human wastewaters (i.e.
4113,"down gradient of a landfill, unsewered residential development, or animal feedlot)."
4114,"Thus, sites sampled were not necessarily used as a source of drinking water but provide a variety of geohydrologic environments with potential sources of OWCs."
4115,"OWCs were detected in 81% of the sites sampled, with 35 of the 65 OWCs being found at least once."
4116,"The most frequently detected compounds include N,N-diethyltoluamide (35%, insect repellant), bisphenol A (30%, plasticizer), tri(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (30%, fire retardant), sulfamethoxazole (23%, veterinary and human antibiotic), and 4-octylphenol monoethoxylate (19%, detergent metabolite)."
4117,Although sampling procedures were intended to ensure that all groundwater samples analyzed were indicative of aquifer conditions it is possible that detections of some OWCs could have resulted from leaching of well-construction materials and/or other site-specific conditions related to well construction and materials.
4118,Future research will be needed to identify those factors that are most important in determining the occurrence and concentrations of OWCs in groundwater.Chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray (ChIP-chip) analysis showed that the nitric oxide (NO)-sensitive repressor NsrR from Escherichia coli binds in vivo to the promoters of the tynA and feaB genes.
4119,These genes encode the first two enzymes of a pathway that is required for the catabolism of phenylethylamine (PEA) and its hydroxylated derivatives tyramine and dopamine.
4120,Deletion of nsrR caused small increases in the activities of the tynA and feaB promoters in cultures grown on PEA.
4121,Overexpression of nsrR severely retarded growth on PEA and caused a marked repression of the tynA and feaB promoters.
4122,Both the growth defect and the promoter repression were reversed in the presence of a source of NO.
4123,These results are consistent with NsrR mediating repression of the tynA and feaB genes by binding (in an NO-sensitive fashion) to the sites identified by ChIP-chip.
4124,"E. coli was shown to use 3-nitrotyramine as a nitrogen source for growth, conditions which partially induce the tynA and feaB promoters."
4125,Mutation of tynA (but not feaB) prevented growth on 3-nitrotyramine.
4126,"Growth yields, mutant phenotypes, and analyses of culture supernatants suggested that 3-nitrotyramine is oxidized to 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetate, with growth occurring at the expense of the amino group of 3-nitrotyramine."
4127,"Accordingly, enzyme assays showed that 3-nitrotyramine and its oxidation product (4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetaldehyde) could be oxidized by the enzymes encoded by tynA and feaB, respectively."
4128,"The results suggest that an additional physiological role of the PEA catabolic pathway is to metabolize nitroaromatic compounds that may accumulate in cells exposed to NO.The cellulose dissolution solvent used in Lyocell process for cellulose fiber preparation, N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) monohydrate, was demonstrated to be an effective agent for sugarcane bagasse pretreatment."
4129,Bagasse of 20wt% was readily dissolved in NMMO monohydrate at 130 degrees C within 1h.
4130,"After dissolution, bagasse could be regenerated by rapid precipitation with water as a porous and amorphous mixture of its original components."
4131,The regenerated bagasse exhibited a significant enhancement on enzymatic hydrolysis kinetic.
4132,Not only the reducing sugars releasing rate but also hydrolysis yield was enhanced at least twofold as compared with that of untreated bagasse.
4133,The cellulose fraction of regenerated bagasse was nearly hydrolyzed to glucose after 72h hydrolysis with Cellulase AP3.
4134,The recycled NMMO demonstrated the same performance as the fresh one on bagasse pretreatment for hydrolysis enhancement.
4135,The regenerated bagasse was directly used in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) for ethanol production by Zymomonas mobilis.
4136,"No negative effect on ethanol fermentation was observed and ethanol yield approximately 0.15 g ethanol/g baggasse was achieved.Nitrodiphenyl ether herbicides, including chlomethoxyfen, nitrofen, and oxyfluorfen are potent herbicides."
4137,Some metabolites and parent compounds are considered as possible mutagens and endocrine disruptors.
4138,Both properties pose serious hygienic and environmental risks.
4139,"Sphingomonas wittichii RW1 is a well-known degrader of polychlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins, dibenzofurans, and diphenyl ethers."
4140,"However, no detailed research of its metabolic activity has been performed against pesticides with a diphenyl ether scaffold."
4141,"In this study, we report S. wittichii RW1 as a very potent diphenyl ether herbicide-metabolizing bacterium with broad substrate specificity."
4142,The structures of metabolites were determined by instrumental analysis and synthetic standards.
4143,Most pesticides were rapidly removed from the culture medium in the order of nitrofen > oxyfluorfen > chlomethoxyfen.
4144,"In general, herbicides were degraded through the initial reduction and N-acetylation of nitro groups, followed by ether bond cleavage."
4145,Relatively low concentrations of phenolic and catecholic metabolites throughout the study suggested that these metabolites were rapidly metabolized and incorporated into primary metabolism.
4146,"These results indicate that strain RW1 has very versatile metabolic activities over a wide range of environmental contaminants.The amphoteric surfactant N-oleoyl-N-methyltaurine, which is in use in skin-care products, was utilized by aerobic bacteria as the sole source of carbon or of nitrogen in enrichment cultures."
4147,"One isolate, which was identified as Pseudomonas alcaligenes, grew with the xenobiotic compound as the sole source of carbon and energy."
4148,"The sulfonate moiety, N-methyltaurine, was excreted quantitatively during growth, while the fatty acid was dissimilated."
4149,The initial degradative reaction was shown to be hydrolytic and inducible.
4150,This amidase reaction could be demonstrated with crude cell extracts.
4151,The excreted N-methyltaurine could be utilized by other bacteria in cocultures.
4152,"Complete degradation of similar natural compounds in bacterial communities seems likely.In many living forms, glucose is stored in the polymeric form of glycogen and starch as a source of carbon and energy."
4153,"Upon need, these polymers are broken down to their building block glucose in the presence of water and hydrolases, and glucose 1-phosphate in the presence of phosphate and phosphorylase."
4154,"In the last decade, we established an alternative glycogen catabolic pathway, the so-called Anhydrofructose (AF) pathway, the description of which was approved by IUBMB in 2006."
4155,"It is a pathway on the formation of an array of secondary metabolites from glycogen via the central intermediate 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose (AF)."
4156,"Furthermore, we demonstrated the occurrence of this pathway in both eukaryota and prokaryota."
4157,Metabolites of this pathway have been identified in mammals including humans.
4158,"In this review, the physiological and molecular functions of these metabolites in the AF pathway as well as its regulation are discussed.We examined the utility of 13 pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) as molecular markers of sewage contamination in riverine, groundwater, and coastal environments."
4159,"The PPCPs were crotamiton, ibuprofen, naproxen, ketoprofen, fenoprofen, mefenamic acid, thymol, triclosan, propyphenazone, carbamazepine, diethyltoluamide, ethenzamide, and caffeine."
4160,"Measurements in 37 Japanese rivers showed positive correlations of riverine flux of crotamiton (r2 = 0.85), carbamazepine (r2 = 0.84), ibuprofen (r2 = 0.73), and mefenamic acid (r2 = 0.67) with the population in the catchments."
4161,"In three surveys in the Tamagawa estuary, crotamiton, carbamazepine, and mefenamic acid behaved conservatively across seasons within a salinity range of 0.4-29 per thousand, suggesting their utility as molecular markers in coastal environments."
4162,Removal of ketoprofen and naproxen in the estuary was ascribed to photodegradation.
4163,Ibuprofen and thymol were removed from estuarine waters in summer by microbial degradation.
4164,"Triclosan was removed by a combination of microbial degradation, photodegradation, and adsorption."
4165,These results were consistent with those of river water incubated for 8 d at 25 degrees C in the dark in order to examine the effects of biodegradation and photodegradation.
4166,"Crotamiton was detected in groundwater from the Tokyo metropolitan area (12 out of 14 samples), suggesting wastewater leakage from decrepit sewers."
4167,"Carbamazepine, ketoprofen, and ibuprofen (5/14), caffeine (4/14), and diethyltoluamide (3/14) were also detected in the groundwater, whereas the other carboxylic and phenolic PPCPs were not detected and were thought to be removed during their passage through soil."
4168,All the data demonstrated the utility of crotamiton and carbamazepine as conservative markers in freshwater and coastal environments.
4169,"We recommend combining these conservative markers with labile PPCPs to detect inputs of poorly treated sewage.Since morpholine oxidation has recently been shown to involve Cytochrome P450, the study on its mechanism at molecular level using quantum chemical calculations for the model of cytochrome active site is reported here."
4170,"The reaction pathway is investigated for two electronic states, the doublet and the quartet, by means of density functional theory."
4171,The results show that morpholine hydroxylation occurs through hydrogen atom abstraction and rebound mechanism.
4172,"However, in the low spin state, the reaction is concerted and hydrogen atom abstraction yields directly ferric-hydroxy morpholine complex without a distinct rebound step while in quartet state the reaction is stepwise."
4173,The presence of nitrogen in a morpholine heterocycle is postulated to greatly facilitate hydrogen abstraction.
4174,"The hydroxylated product undergoes intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer from hydroxy group to nitrogen, leading to the cleavage of the C-N bond and the formation of 2-(2-aminoethoxy) acetaldehyde."
4175,The cleavage of the C-N bond is indicated as the rate-determining step for the studied reaction.
4176,The assistance of explicit water molecule is shown to lower the energy barrier for the C-N bond cleavage in enzymatic environment whereas solvent effects mimicked by COSMO solvent model have minor influence on relative energies along the pathway.In this paper we report about the biodegradation of the beta-blocker atenolol and the hypoglycaemic agent glibenclamide.
4177,"The biodegradation tests were performed in batch reactors under aerobic conditions, using as inocculums sewage sludge from a conventional activated sludge treatment and a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor."
4178,"Pharmaceuticals were used as sole carbon sources, spiked at 50ng/L and 10mg/L concentrations."
4179,Quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled to ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatograph was used for the screening and the structural elucidation of biodegradation products.
4180,A microbial metabolite of atenolol with (+) at 268 was detected in the positive electrospray ionization mode.
4181,This new compound was determined to be a product of microbial hydrolysis of the amide of the parent compound.
4182,"Biodegradation of glibenclamide by activated sludge proceeded via bacterial hydroxylation of the cyclohexyl ring, which resulted in formation of metabolite with a protonated molecule, (+)=510."
4183,MS(3) experiments performed by hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap (QqLIT) mass spectrometry coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography enabled further structural elucidation of the identified metabolites.
4184,"Moreover, the highly sensitive QqLIT instrument in the MRM mode enabled the detection of parent compounds and one of the microbial metabolites identified in real wastewater samples."
4185,"The methodology used in this study permitted for the first time the identification and detection of biodegradation product of beta-blocker atenolol in real wastewater samples.We have developed a new method for the determination of the widely used herbicide 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile (dichlobenil) and its major metabolites 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) and 2,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (2,6-DCBA) in groundwater samples."
4186,The procedure is based on solid phase extraction (SPE) combined with a derivatization procedure before GC-MS analysis in order to quantify analytes simultaneously.
4187,This method can be used from regulatory laboratories for monitoring the presence of dichlobenil and its metabolites during testing groundwater samples quality.The genus Sphingomonas (sensu latu) belongs to the alpha-Proteobacteria and comprises strictly aerobic chemoheterotrophic bacteria that are widespread in various aquatic and terrestrial environments.
4188,"The members of this genus are often isolated and studied because of their ability to degrade recalcitrant natural and anthropogenic compounds, such as (substituted) biphenyl(s) and naphthalene(s), fluorene, (substituted) phenanthrene(s), pyrene, (chlorinated) diphenylether(s), (chlorinated) furan(s), (chlorinated) dibenzo-p-dioxin(s), carbazole, estradiol, polyethylene glycols, chlorinated phenols, nonylphenols, and different herbicides and pesticides."
4189,The metabolic versatility of these organisms suggests that they have evolved mechanisms to adapt quicker and/or more efficiently to the degradation of novel compounds in the environment than members of other bacterial genera.
4190,Comparative analyses demonstrate that sphingomonads generally use similar degradative pathways as other groups of microorganisms but deviate from competing microorganisms by the existence of multiple hydroxylating oxygenases and the conservation of specific gene clusters.
4191,"Furthermore, there is increasing evidence for the existence of plasmids that only can be disseminated among sphingomonads and which undergo after conjugative transfer pronounced rearrangements.This paper discusses the degradation kinetics of mixed (lindane, methyl parathion and carbofuran) pesticides by mixed pesticide enriched cultures (MEC) under various environmental conditions."
4192,"The bacterial strains isolated from the mixed microbial consortium were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC 9236), Bacillus sp."
4193,(MTCC 9235) and Chryseobacterium joostei (MTCC 9237).
4194,"Batch studies were conducted to estimate the biokinetic parameters like the maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)), Yield Coefficient (Y(T)), half saturation concentration (K(s)) and inhibition concentration (Ki) for individual and mixed pesticide enriched cultures."
4195,The cultures enriched in a particular pollutant always showed high growth rate and low inhibition in that particular pollutant compared to MEC.
4196,"After seven weeks of incubation, mixed pesticide enriched cultures were able to degrade 72% lindane, 95% carbofuran and 100% of methyl parathion in facultative co-metabolic conditions."
4197,"In aerobic systems, degradation efficiencies of lindane methyl parathion and carbofuran were increased by the addition of 2g L(- 1) of dextrose."
4198,"Though many metabolic compounds of mixed pesticides were observed at different time intervals, none of the metabolites were persistent."
4199,"Based on the observed metabolites, a degradation pathway was postulated for different pesticides under various environmental conditions.Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been the focus of much recent research as concerns rise about their occurrence in bodies of water worldwide."
4200,"In an effort to characterize the risk and determine the prevalence of these micropollutants in lakes and rivers, many researchers are examining PPCP removal from impaired water during wastewater treatment and water recycling (soil passage) processes."
4201,"Biodegradation studies and projects considering combinations of biodegradation and other removal processes have been conducted over a wide range of compound categories and therapeutic classes, as well as across different systems and scales of study."
4202,"This review summarizes the extent of PPCP removal observed in these various systems.The antiviral drug Tamiflu (Oseltamivir Phosphate, OP), has been indicated by the World Health Organization as a first-line defense in case of an avian influenza pandemic."
4203,"Recent studies have demonstrated that Oseltamivir Carboxylate (OC), the active metabolite of the prodrug OP, has the potential to be released into water bodies."
4204,"The present laboratory study focused on basic processes governing the environmental fate of OC in surface water from two contrasting aquatic ecosystems of northern Italy, the River Po and the Venice lagoon."
4205,Results of this study confirmed the potential of OC to persist in surface water.
4206,"However, addition of 5% of sediments resulted in rapid OC degradation."
4207,Estimated half-life of OC in water/sediment of the River Po was 15 days.
4208,"After three weeks of incubation at 20 degrees C, more than 8% of (14)C-OC evolved as (14)CO(2) from water/sediment samples of the River Po and Venice lagoon."
4209,"At the end of the 21-day incubation period, more than 65% of the (14)C-residues were recovered from the liquid phase of both Po and Venice water/sediment samples."
4210,OC was moderately retained onto coarse sediments from the two sites.
4211,"In water/sediment samples of the River Po and Venice lagoon treated with (14)C-OC, more than 30% of the (14)C-residues remained water-extractable after three weeks of incubation."
4212,The low affinity of OC to sediments suggests that presence of sediments would not reduce its bioavailability to microbial degradation.Lignified cell walls are widely considered to be key innovations in the evolution of terrestrial plants from aquatic ancestors some 475 million years ago.
4213,"Lignins, complex aromatic heteropolymers, stiffen and fortify secondary cell walls within xylem tissues, creating a dense matrix that binds cellulose microfibrils and crosslinks other wall components, thereby preventing the collapse of conductive vessels, lending biomechanical support to stems, and allowing plants to adopt an erect-growth habit in air."
4214,"Although ""lignin-like"" compounds have been identified in primitive green algae, the presence of true lignins in nonvascular organisms, such as aquatic algae, has not been confirmed."
4215,"Here, we report the discovery of secondary walls and lignin within cells of the intertidal red alga Calliarthron cheilosporioides."
4216,"Until now, such developmentally specialized cell walls have been described only in vascular plants."
4217,"The finding of secondary walls and lignin in red algae raises many questions about the convergent or deeply conserved evolutionary history of these traits, given that red algae and vascular plants probably diverged more than 1 billion years ago.A bacterium with an exceptional ability to hydrolyse fenamiphos and its toxic oxidation products fenamiphos sulfoxide and fenamiphos sulfone, all possessing POC bond was isolated from soil."
4218,"Based on 16S rRNA gene determination, this bacterium was putatively identified as Microbacterium esteraromaticum."
4219,"The phenols (fenamiphos phenol, sulfoxide phenol and sulfone phenol) formed during bacterial hydrolysis resisted further degradation in mineral salts medium and sterile groundwater, but were transitory in non-sterile groundwater due to the catabolism of native microorganisms."
4220,"Also, the cell-free preparation of this bacterium was highly effective in hydrolysing fenamiphos and its oxides."
4221,"These results demonstrate the potential of this bacterium to detoxify pesticide waste in the environment including the groundwater.The study investigated carbon and chlorine isotope fractionation during aerobic oxidation and reductive dechlorination of vinyl chloride (VC) and cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE)."
4222,The experimental data followed a Rayleigh trend.
4223,"For aerobic oxidation, the average carbon isotope enrichment factors were -7.2 per thousand and -8.5% for VC and cDCE, respectively, while average chlorine isotope enrichment factors were only -0.3 per thousand for both compounds."
4224,These values are consistent with an initial transformation by epoxidation for which a significant primary carbon isotope effect and only a small secondary chlorine isotope effect is expected.
4225,"For reductive dechlorination, larger carbon isotope enrichment factors of -25.2 per thousand for VC and -18.5 per thousand for cDCE were observed consistent with previous studies."
4226,"Although the average chlorine isotope enrichmentfactors were larger than those of aerobic oxidation (-1.8 per thousand for VC, -1.5 per thousand for cDCE), they were not as large as typically expected for a primary chlorine isotope effect suggesting that no cleavage of C-Cl bonds takes place during the initial rate-limiting step."
4227,The ratio of isotope enrichment factors for chlorine and carbon were substantially different for the two reaction mechanisms suggesting that the reaction mechanisms can be differentiated at the field scale using a dual isotope approach.Medical treatments and personal hygiene lead to the steady release of pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) into the environment.
4228,Some of these PPCPs have been shown to have detrimental environmental effects and could potentially impact human health.
4229,"Understanding the biological transformation of PPCPs is essential for accurately determining their ultimate environmental fate, conducting accurate risk assessments, and improving PPCP removal."
4230,"We summarize the current literature concerning the biological transformation of PPCPs in wastewater treatment plants, the environment, and by pure cultures of bacterial isolates."
4231,"Although some PPCPs, such as ibuprofen, are readily degraded under most studied conditions, others, such as carbamazepine, tend to be recalcitrant."
4232,"This variation in the biodegradability of PPCPs can be attributed to structural differences, because PPCPs are classified by application, not chemical structure."
4233,The degradation pathways of octylphenol by Sphingomonas sp.
4234,"strain PWE1, ibuprofen by Sphingomonas sp."
4235,"strain Ibu-2, and DEET by Pseudomonas putida DTB are discussed in more detail.Separate quantification of three classes of tfdA genes was performed using TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR for 13 different soils subsequent to mineralization of three phenoxy acids."
4236,"Class III tfdA genes were found to be involved in mineralization more often than class I and II tfdA genes.A sampling campaign was carried out for n-chloridazon (n-CLZ) and its degradation product desphenyl-chloridazon (DPC) in the Hesse region (Germany) during the year 2007: a total of 548 environmental samples including groundwater, surface water and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent were analysed."
4237,"Furthermore, aerobic degradation of n-CLZ has been studied utilising a fixed bed bioreactor (FBBR)."
4238,"In surface water, n-CLZ was detected at low concentrations (average 0.01+/-0.06mugL(-1); maximum 0.89mugL(-1)) with a seasonal peak, whereas DPC was present throughout the year at much higher concentrations (average 0.72+/-0.81mugL(-1); maximum 7.4mugL(-1))."
4239,"Higher n-CLZ concentrations were observed in the North compared with South Hesse, which is ascribed to a higher density of agricultural areas."
4240,"Furthermore, methylated DPC (Me-DPC), another degradation product, was detected in surface water."
4241,"In the degradation test, n-CLZ was completely converted to DPC at all concentrations tested (Me-DPC was not formed under the test conditions)."
4242,DPC was resistant to further degradation during the whole experimental period of 98 days.
4243,The results obtained suggest persistence and high dispersion of DPC in the aquatic environment.To study the degradation of phorate by a bacterium isolated from phorate-contaminated sites.Pseudomonas putida CBB5 was isolated from soil by enrichment on caffeine.
4244,"This strain used not only caffeine, theobromine, paraxanthine, and 7-methylxanthine as sole carbon and nitrogen sources but also theophylline and 3-methylxanthine."
4245,Analyses of metabolites in spent media and resting cell suspensions confirmed that CBB5 initially N demethylated theophylline via a hitherto unreported pathway to 1- and 3-methylxanthines.
4246,NAD(P)H-dependent conversion of theophylline to 1- and 3-methylxanthines was also detected in the crude cell extracts of theophylline-grown CBB5.
4247,1-Methylxanthine and 3-methylxanthine were subsequently N demethylated to xanthine.
4248,"CBB5 also oxidized theophylline and 1- and 3-methylxanthines to 1,3-dimethyluric acid and 1- and 3-methyluric acids, respectively."
4249,"However, these methyluric acids were not metabolized further."
4250,A broad-substrate-range xanthine-oxidizing enzyme was responsible for the formation of these methyluric acids.
4251,"In contrast, CBB5 metabolized caffeine to theobromine (major metabolite) and paraxanthine (minor metabolite)."
4252,These dimethylxanthines were further N demethylated to xanthine via 7-methylxanthine.
4253,"Theobromine-, paraxanthine-, and 7-methylxanthine-grown cells also metabolized all of the methylxanthines mentioned above via the same pathway."
4254,"Thus, the theophylline and caffeine N-demethylation pathways converged at xanthine via different methylxanthine intermediates."
4255,Xanthine was eventually oxidized to uric acid.
4256,Enzymes involved in theophylline and caffeine degradation were coexpressed when CBB5 was grown on theophylline or on caffeine or its metabolites.
4257,"However, 3-methylxanthine-grown CBB5 cells did not metabolize caffeine, whereas theophylline was metabolized at much reduced levels to only methyluric acids."
4258,"To our knowledge, this is the first report of theophylline N demethylation and coexpression of distinct pathways for caffeine and theophylline degradation in bacteria.Stenotrophomonas sp."
4259,RMSK capable of degrading acenaphthylene as a sole source of carbon and energy was isolated from coal sample.
4260,"Metabolites produced were analyzed and characterized by TLC, HPLC and mass spectrometry."
4261,"Identification of naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid, 1-naphthoic acid, 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, salicylate and detection of key enzymes namely 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene dioxygenase, salicylaldehyde dehydrogenase and catechol-1,2-dioxygenase in the cell free extract suggest that acenaphthylene metabolized via 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene, salicylate and catechol."
4262,"The terminal metabolite, catechol was then metabolized by catechol-1,2-dioxygenase to cis,cis-muconic acid, ultimately forming TCA cycle intermediates."
4263,"Based on these studies, the proposed metabolic pathway in strain RMSK is, acenaphthylene --> naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid --> 1-naphthoic acid --> 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene --> salicylic acid --> catechol --> cis,cis-muconic acid.Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) is the most important antiviral drug available and a cornerstone in the defence against a future influenza pandemic."
4264,"Recent publications have shown that the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), is not degraded in sewage treatment plants and is also persistent in aquatic environments."
4265,This implies that OC will be present in aquatic environments in areas where oseltamivir is prescribed to patients for therapeutic use.
4266,"The country where oseltamivir is used most is Japan, where it is used to treat seasonal flu."
4267,"We measured the levels of OC in water samples from the Yodo River system in the Kyoto and Osaka prefectures, Japan, taken before and during the flu-season 2007/8."
4268,No OC was detected before the flu-season but 2-58 ng L(-1) was detected in the samples taken during the flu season.
4269,"This study shows, for the first time, that low levels of oseltamivir can be found in the aquatic environment."
4270,"Therefore the natural reservoir of influenza virus, dabbling ducks, is exposed to oseltamivir, which could promote the evolution of viral resistance.Natural estrogens such as estrone, 17beta-estradiol, estriol, and the particularly recalcitrant synthetic estrogen 17alpha-ethinylestradiol used as oral contraceptive, accumulate in the environment and may give rise to health problems."
4271,"The processes participating in their removal from soil, wastewater, water-sediments, groundwater-aquifer material, and wastewater or sewage treatment plant effluents may involve the action of bacterial and microbial consortia, and in some cases fungi and algae."
4272,"This review discusses the different efficiencies of bacterial degradation of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, the role of sulfate-, nitrate-, and iron-reducing conditions in anaerobic degradation, and the role of sorption."
4273,"The participation of autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria in cometabolic degradation of estrogens, the estrogen-degrading action of ligninolytic fungi and their extracellular enzymes (lignin peroxidase, manganese-dependent peroxidase, versatile peroxidase, laccase), and of algae are discussed in detail.The widely used herbicide atrazine and some of its degradation products are among the most commonly found xenobiotics in groundwater in Europe as well as in the USA."
4274,The bacterium Pseudomonas sp.
4275,strain ADP (P. ADP) possesses genes encoding atrazine mineralization on the self-transmissible plasmid pADP-1.
4276,"In the present study, this ability of the strain to mineralize atrazine in aquifer sediment under both aerobic and denitrifying conditions at 10 degrees C was studied."
4277,P. ADP was able to mineralize more than 50% of 2.8 muM atrazine within 14 days under both growth conditions.
4278,Counts of degraders as colony forming units (CFU) on atrazine plates and counts of atzA gene copies as determined by quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) were performed.
4279,The atzA gene encodes the enzyme which catalyzes the first step of atrazine mineralization by the strain.
4280,Quantification of the atzA gene gave rise to higher numbers than did counts of CFU.
4281,"High nitrate concentrations inhibited atrazine mineralization and culturability on agar plates, but atzA copy numbers remained stable throughout the experiment."
4282,"The results show a potential for bioaugmentation using P. ADP at both aerobic and denitrifying conditions and the use of cPCR as a tool for monitoring the bacteria independent of culturability.Many litter-decay fungi secrete heme-thiolate peroxygenases that oxidize various organic chemicals, but little is known about the role or mechanism of these enzymes."
4283,"We found that the extracellular peroxygenase of Agrocybe aegerita catalyzed the H2O2-dependent cleavage of environmentally significant ethers, including methyl t-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and 1,4-dioxane."
4284,"Experiments with tetrahydrofuran showed the reaction was a two-electron oxidation that generated one aldehyde group and one alcohol group, yielding the ring-opened product 4-hydroxybutanal."
4285,"Investigations with several model substrates provided information about the route for ether cleavage: (a) steady-state kinetics results with methyl 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl ether, which was oxidized to 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, gave parallel double reciprocal plots suggestive of a ping-pong mechanism (K(m)((peroxide)), 1.99 +/- 0.25 mM; K(m)((ether)), 1.43 +/- 0.23 mM; k(cat), 720 +/- 87 s(-1)), (b) the cleavage of methyl 4-nitrobenzyl ether in the presence of H2(18)O2 resulted in incorporation of 18O into the carbonyl group of the resulting 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, and (c) the demethylation of 1-methoxy-4-trideuteromethoxybenzene showed an observed intramolecular deuterium isotope effect  of 11.9 +/- 0.4."
4286,"These results suggest a hydrogen abstraction and oxygen rebound mechanism that oxidizes ethers to hemiacetals, which subsequently hydrolyze."
4287,"The peroxygenase appeared to lack activity on macromolecular ethers, but otherwise exhibited a broad substrate range."
4288,It may accordingly have a role in the biodegradation of natural and anthropogenic low molecular weight ethers in soils and plant litter.This study explored the effect of different bulk organic carbon matrices on the fate of trace organic chemicals (TOrC) during managed aquifer recharge (MAR).
4289,Infiltration through porous media was simulated in biologically active column experiments under aerobic and anoxic recharge conditions.
4290,"Wastewater effluent derived organic carbon types, differing in hydrophobicity and biodegradability (i. e., hydrophobic acids, hydrophilic carbon, organic colloids), were used as feed substrates in the column experiments."
4291,These carbon substrates while fed at the same concentration differed in their ability to support soil biomass growth during porous media infiltration.
4292,Removal of degradable TOrC (with the exception of diclofenac and propyphenazone) was equal or better under aerobic versus anoxic porous media infiltration conditions.
4293,"During the initial phase of infiltration, the presence of biodegradable organic carbon (BDOC) enhanced the decay of degradable TOrC by promoting soil biomass growth, suggesting that BDOC served as a co-substrate in a co-metabolic transformation of these contaminants."
4294,"However, unexpected high removal efficiencies were observed for all degradable TOrC in the presence of low BDOC concentrations under well adopted oligotrophic conditions."
4295,It is hypothesized that removal under these conditions is caused by a specialized microbial community growing on refractory carbon substrates such as hydrophobic acids.
4296,Findings of this study reveal that the concentration and character of bulk organic carbon present in effluents affect the degradation efficiency for TOrC during recharge operation.
4297,"Specifically aerobic, oligotrophic microbiological soil environments present favorable conditions for the transformation of TOrC, including rather recalcitrant compounds such as chlorinated flame retardants.The University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database (UM-BBD, http://umbbd.msi.umn.edu/) began in 1995 and now contains information on almost 1200 compounds, over 800 enzymes, almost 1300 reactions and almost 500 microorganism entries."
4298,"Besides these data, it includes a Biochemical Periodic Table (UM-BPT) and a rule-based Pathway Prediction System (UM-PPS) (http://umbbd.msi.umn.edu/predict/) that predicts plausible pathways for microbial degradation of organic compounds."
4299,"Currently, the UM-PPS contains 260 biotransformation rules derived from reactions found in the UM-BBD and scientific literature."
4300,Public access to UM-BBD data is increasing.
4301,"UM-BBD compound data are now contributed to PubChem and ChemSpider, the public chemical databases."
4302,"A new mirror website of the UM-BBD, UM-BPT and UM-PPS is being developed at ETH Z\xc3\xbcrich to improve speed and reliability of online access from anywhere in the world.Synthetic pyrethroids are one of the most frequently and widely used class of insecticides, primarily because they have a higher insect to mammalian toxicity ratio than organochlorines or organophosphates."
4303,The basic structure of pyrethroids can be characterized as an acid joined to an alcohol by an ester bond.
4304,"Pyrethroid degradation occurs through either oxidation at one or more sites located in the alcohol or acid moieties or hydrolysis at the central ester bond, the latter reaction being important for mammalian metabolism of most pyrethroids."
4305,"The primary alcohol liberated from the ester cleavage is hydroxylated to 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol, which for most pyrethroids is then oxidized to 3-phenoxybenzoic acid."
4306,"These products may then be conjugated with amino acids, sulfates, sugars, or sugar acids."
4307,In vitro studies have suggested that some of the pyrethroids may have estrogenic activity.
4308,"Interestingly, the chemical structure of specific pyrethroid metabolites indicates that they may be more likely to interact with the estrogen receptor than the parent compounds."
4309,"Two of the pyrethroid metabolites, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA) and 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol (3PBalc) have been reported to have endocrine activity using a yeast based assay."
4310,3PBAlc exhibited estrogenic activity with reported EC(50)s of 6.67 x 10(-6) and 2 x 10(-5) while 3PBAcid exhibited anti-estrogenic activity with a calculated IC(50) of 6.5 x 10(-5).
4311,"To determine if the metabolites were able to cause the same effects in a mammalian system, the estrogen-dependent cell line, MCF-7, was utilized."
4312,"Cells were treated with 1.0, 10.0 or 100.0 microM concentrations of each metabolite and cytotoxicity was assessed."
4313,The two lowest concentrations of both metabolites did not induce cell death and even appeared to increase proliferation over that of the control cells.
4314,"However, when cellular proliferation was measured using a Coulter counter neither metabolite stimulated proliferation (1.0 nM, 10.0 nM, or 10.0 microM) or induced an estrogen receptor alpha/ERE-controlled luciferase reporter in the MCF-7 cells."
4315,"Following the in vitro screenings, the metabolites were then evaluated for estrogenic activity in vivo using the uterotrophic assay in Sprague-Dawley rats."
4316,"Animals were orally gavaged (10.0, 5.0, and 1.0 mg/kg) once daily for 3 days."
4317,"Neither metabolite had any effect on uterine wet weight, body weight, or organ weight."
4318,"Lastly, in order to determine if either metabolite was able to alter the onset of puberty, immature female rats were orally gavaged (10.0, 5.0, and 1.0 mg/kg) once a day with the metabolites beginning 1 day post-weaning until the onset of puberty as evidenced by vaginal opening (VO)."
4319,"Again, neither metabolite had any effect on the onset of VO.Ketoprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has been detected in the environment in the range of ng L(-1)-microg L(-1) due to its low degradability in some wastewater treatment plants."
4320,"In this study, the use of the white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor to effectively degrade ketoprofen in a defined liquid medium was assessed."
4321,The fungus eliminated ketoprofen to nondetectable levels in 24h when it was added at 10mgL(-1) whereas at low concentration of 40microgL(-1) it was almost completely removed (95%) after 5h.
4322,Low extracellular laccase activity was detected in the T. versicolor cultures but the addition of the laccase-mediator system did not lead to ketoprofen oxidation.
4323,The cytochrome P-450 inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole reduced ketoprofen oxidation.
4324,These data suggest that the first oxidation step is cytochrome P450 mediated.
4325,"During time-course degradation experiments, three intermediates were structurally elucidated and quantified by HPLC-DAD-MS and NMR: 2--propanoic acid, 2--propanoic acid, and 2-(3-benzoyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propanoic acid."
4326,The latter was reported for the first time in biological systems.
4327,"After 7 d of incubation, only small amounts of 2--propanoic acid (0.08mg) remained in the liquid medium in comparison with the initial ketoprofen dose (1.0mg), suggesting possible mineralization of ketoprofen.Biodegradation of the laundry surfactant linear alkylbenzenesulfonate (LAS) involves complex bacterial communities."
4328,The known heterotrophic community has two tiers.
4329,"First, all LAS congeners are oxygenated and oxidized to about 50 sulfophenylcarboxylates (SPC)."
4330,"Second, the SPCs are mineralized."
4331,Comamonas testosteroni KF-1 mineralizes 3-(4-sulfophenyl)butyrate (3-C4-SPC).
4332,"During growth of strain KF-1 with 3-C4-SPC, two transient intermediates were detected in the culture medium."
4333,One intermediate was identified as 4-sulfoacetophenone (SAP) (4-acetylbenzenesulfonate) by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
4334,The other was 4-sulfophenol (SP).
4335,"This information allowed us to postulate a degradation pathway that comprises the removal of an acetyl moiety from (derivatized) 3-C4-SPC, followed by a Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenation of SAP and subsequent ester cleavage to yield SP."
4336,Inducible NADPH-dependent SAP-oxygenase was detected in crude extracts of strain KF-1.
4337,"The enzyme reaction involved transient formation of 4-sulfophenol acetate (SPAc), which was completely hydrolyzed to SP and acetate."
4338,"SP was subject to NADH-dependent oxygenation in crude extract, and 4-sulfocatechol (SC) was subject to oxygenolytic ring cleavage."
4339,"The first complete degradative pathway for an SPC can now be depicted with 3-C4-SPC: transport, ligation to a coenzyme A (CoA) ester, and manipulation to allow abstraction of acetyl-CoA to yield SAP, Baeyer-Villiger monooxygenation to SPAc, hydrolysis of the ester to acetate and SP, monooxygenation of SP to SC, the ortho ring-cleavage pathway with desulfonation, and sulfite oxidation.Methamidophos is one of the most widely used organophosphorus insecticides usually detectable in the environment."
4340,"A facultative methylotroph, Hyphomicrobium sp."
4341,"MAP-1, capable of high efficiently degrading methamidophos, was isolated from methamidophos-contaminated soil in China."
4342,It was found that the addition of methanol significantly promoted the growth of strain MAP-1 and enhanced its degradation of methamidophos.
4343,"Further, this strain could utilize methamidophos as its sole carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus source for growth and could completely degrade 3,000 mg l(-1) methamidophos in 84 h under optimal conditions (pH 7.0, 30 degrees C)."
4344,The enzyme responsible for methamidophos degradation was mainly located on the cell inner membrane (90.4%).
4345,"During methamidophos degradation, three metabolites were detected and identified based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis."
4346,"Using this information, a biochemical degradation pathway of methamidophos by Hyphomicrobium sp."
4347,MAP-1 was proposed for the first time.
4348,"Methamidophos is first cleaved at the P-N bond to form O,S-dimethyl hydrogen thiophosphate and NH(3)."
4349,"Subsequently, O,S-dimethyl hydrogen thiophosphate is hydrolyzed at the P-O bond to release -OCH(3) and form S-methyl dihydrogen thiophosphate."
4350,"O,S-dimethyl hydrogen thiophosphate can also be hydrolyzed at the P-S bond to release -SCH(3) and form methyl dihydrogen phosphate."
4351,"Finally, S-methyl dihydrogen thiophosphate and methyl dihydrogen phosphate are likely transformed into phosphoric acid.Isocarbophos is a widely used organophosphorus insecticide that has caused environmental pollution in many areas."
4352,"However, degradation of isocarbophos by pure cultures has not been extensively studied, and the degradation pathway has not been determined."
4353,"In this paper, a highly effective isocarbophos-degrading strain, scl-2, was isolated from isocarbophos-polluted soil."
4354,Strain scl-2 was preliminarily identified as Arthrobacter sp.
4355,"based on its morphological, physiological, and biochemical properties, as well as 16S rDNA analysis."
4356,Strain scl-2 could utilize isocarbophos as its sole source of carbon and phosphorus for growth.
4357,"One hundred mg/l isocarbophos could be degraded to a nondetectable level in 18 h by scl-2 in cell culture, and isofenphos-methyl, profenofos, and phosmet could also be degraded."
4358,"During the degradation of isocarbophos, the metabolites isopropyl salicylate, salicylate, and gentisate were detected and identified based on MS/MS analysis and their retention times in HPLC."
4359,"Transformation of gentisate to pyruvate and fumarate via maleylpyruvate and fumarylpyruvate was detected by assaying for the activities of gentisate 1,2- dioxygenase (GDO) and maleylpyruvate isomerase."
4360,"Therefore, we have identified the degradation pathway of isocarbophos in Arthrobacter sp."
4361,scl-2 for the first time.
4362,This study highlights an important potential use of the strain scl-2 for the cleanup of environmental contamination by isocarbophos and presents a mechanism of isocarbophos metabolism.Phthalate esters (PEs) are important environmental pollutants.
4363,"While the biodegradation of the parent compound, phthalate (PTH), is well characterized, the biodegradation of PEs is not well understood."
4364,"In particular, prior to this study, genes involved in the uptake and hydrolysis of these compounds were not conclusively identified."
4365,"We found that Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 could grow on a variety of monoalkyl PEs, including methyl, butyl, hexyl, and 2-ethylhexyl PTHs."
4366,"Strain RHA1 could not grow on most dialkyl PEs, but suspensions of cells grown on PTH transformed dimethyl, diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, dihexyl and di-(2-ethylhexyl) PTHs."
4367,"The major products of these dialkyl PEs were PTH and the corresponding monoalkyl PEs, and minor products resulted from the shortening of the alkyl side chains."
4368,"RHA1 exhibited an inducible, ATP-dependent uptake system for PTH with a K(m) of 22 microM."
4369,The deletion and complementation of the patB gene demonstrated that the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter encoded by patDABC is required for the uptake of PTH and monoalkyl PEs by RHA1.
4370,The hydrolase encoded by patE of RHA1 was expressed in Escherichia coli.
4371,PatE specifically hydrolyzed monoalkyl PEs to PTH but did not transform dialkyl PEs or other aromatic esters.
4372,This investigation of RHA1 elucidates key processes that are consistent with the environmental fate of PEs.Anaerobic ethylbenzene metabolism in the betaproteobacterium Aromatoleum aromaticum is initiated by anaerobic oxidation to acetophenone via (S)-1-phenylethanol.
4373,"The subsequent carboxylation of acetophenone to benzoylacetate is catalyzed by an acetophenone-induced enzyme, which has been purified and studied."
4374,The same enzyme is involved in acetophenone metabolism in the absence of ethylbenzene.
4375,"Acetophenone carboxylase consists of five subunits with molecular masses of 70, 15, 87, 75, and 34 kDa, whose genes (apcABCDE) form an apparent operon."
4376,"The enzyme is synthesized at high levels in cells grown on ethylbenzene or acetophenone, but not in cells grown on benzoate."
4377,"During purification, acetophenone carboxylase dissociates into inactive subcomplexes consisting of the 70-, 15-, 87-, and 75-kDa subunits (apcABCD gene products) and the 34-kDa subunit (apcE gene product), respectively."
4378,Acetophenone carboxylase activity was restored by mixing the purified subcomplexes.
4379,The enzyme contains 1 Zn(2+) ion per alphabetagammadelta core complex and is dependent on the presence of Mg(2+) or Mn(2+).
4380,"In spite of the presence of Zn in the enzyme, it is strongly inhibited by Zn(2+) ions."
4381,"Carboxylation of acetophenone is dependent on ATP hydrolysis to ADP and P(i), exhibiting a stoichiometry of 2 mol ATP per mol acetophenone carboxylated."
4382,The enzyme shows uncoupled ATPase activity with either bicarbonate or acetophenone in the absence of the second substrate.
4383,"These observations indicate that both substrates may be phosphorylated, which is consistent with isotope exchange activity observed with deuterated acetophenone and inhibition by carbamoylphosphate, a structural analogue of carboxyphosphate."
4384,"A potential mechanism of ATP-dependent acetophenone carboxylation is suggested.Biodegradation of synthetic compounds has been studied extensively, but the metabolic diversity required for catabolism of many natural compounds has not been addressed."
4385,"5-Nitroanthranilic acid (5NAA), produced in soil by Streptomyces scabies, is also the starting material for synthetic dyes and other nitroaromatic compounds."
4386,Bradyrhizobium JS329 was isolated from soil by selective enrichment with 5NAA.
4387,"When grown on 5NAA, the isolate released stoichiometric amounts of nitrite and half of the stoichiometric amounts of ammonia."
4388,Enzyme assays indicate that the initial step in 5NAA degradation is an unusual hydrolytic deamination for formation of 5-nitrosalicylic acid (5NSA).
4389,Cloning and heterologous expression revealed the genes that encode 5NAA deaminase (naaA) and the 5NSA dioxygenase (naaB) that cleaves the aromatic ring of 5NSA without prior removal of the nitro group.
4390,The results provide the first clear evidence for the initial steps in biodegradation of amino-nitroaromatic compounds and reveal a novel deamination reaction for aromatic amines.One of the various ecosystemic services sustained by soil is pollutant degradation mediated by adapted soil bacteria.
4391,The pathways of atrazine biodegradation have been elucidated but in situ expression of the genes involved in atrazine degradation has yet to be demonstrated in soil.
4392,"Expression of the atzA and atzD genes involved in atrazine dechlorination and s-triazine ring cleavage, respectively, was investigated during in situ degradation of atrazine in the soil drilosphere and bulked samples from two agricultural soils that differed in their ability to mineralize atrazine."
4393,"Interestingly, expression of the atzA gene, although present in both soils, was not detected."
4394,"Atrazine mineralization was greatest in Epoisses soil, where a larger pool of atzD mRNA was consistently measured 7 days after atrazine treatment, compared with Vezin soil (146 vs. 49 mRNA per 10(6)16S rRNA, respectively)."
4395,Expression of the atzD gene varied along the degradation time course and was profoundly modified in soil bioturbated by earthworms.
4396,The atzD mRNA pool was the highest in the soil drilosphere (casts and burrow-linings) and it was significantly different in burrow-linings compared with bulk soil (e.g.
4397,"363 vs. 146 mRNA per 10(6)16S rRNA, 7 days after atrazine treatment in Epoisses soil)."
4398,"Thus, consistent differences in atrazine mineralization were demonstrated between the soil drilosphere and bulk soil."
4399,"However, the impact of bioturbation on atrazine mineralization depended on soil type."
4400,"Mineralization was enhanced in casts, compared with bulk soil, from Epoisses soil but in burrow-linings from Vezin soil."
4401,"This study is the first to report the effects of soil bioturbation by earthworms on s-triazine ring cleavage and its spatial variability in soil.One possible explanation for unexplained disappearance of vinyl chloride (VC) from what are thought to be anaerobic subsurface environments is that the environments are, in fact, not anaerobic."
4402,"Rather, they might be subject to low, steady influx of oxygen, and aerobic oxidation could be occurring at extremely low oxygen concentrations."
4403,"Studies were conducted with VC-oxidizing transfer cultures derived from two chloroethene-contaminated sites, as well as with microcosms constructed from sediment and groundwater from one of these sites."
4404,Oxygen was steadily delivered to the experimental systems using permeation tubes to maintain low dissolved oxygen throughout the time-course of investigation.
4405,"VC oxidation was sustained at dissolved oxygen concentrations below 0.02 mg/L in the two transfer cultures, and below 0.1 mg/L in the microcosms."
4406,"This supports the possibility that-at least at some sites-apparent loss of VC from what are thought to be anaerobic zones might, in fact, be due to aerobic pathways occurring under conditions of low oxygen flux (e.g., via diffusion from surrounding aerobic regions and/or from recharge events).An analytical method was developed for the determination of nine antiviral drugs (acyclovir, abacavir, lamivudine, nevirapine oseltamivir, penciclovir, ribavirin, stavudine, zidovudine) and one active metabolite (oseltamivir carboxylate) in raw and treated wastewater as well as in surface water using LC/ESI tandem MS detection."
4407,Relative recoveries exceeded 80% and limits of quantification ranged between 0.2 and 10 ng L(-1).
4408,Matrix effects were compensated by the use of stable isotope labeled surrogate standards and optimized chromatographic separation on a Hydro-RP column.
4409,"All antiviral drugs, except ribavirin, were detected in raw wastewater."
4410,"A significant reduction in concentrations was observed for acyclovir, lamivudine, and abacavir in treated wastewater indicating a substantial removal, while nevirapine, zidovudine and oseltamivir were found in similar concentrations in raw and treated wastewater."
4411,"Concentrations in river waters were in the lower ng L(-1)-range, with a maximum of 190 and 170 ng L(-1) for acyclovir and zidovudine, respectively in the Hessian Ried."
4412,Estimated total compound loads in the Ruhr river ranged between <0.1 and 16.5 g d(-1) while for the Rhine river values between 370 and 1800 g d(-1) were determined.
4413,"The ratios of oseltamivir to oseltamivir carboxylate were approximately a factor of 10 higher for the Rhine than for the other rivers and streams indicating a significant contribution from other sources such as discharges from manufacturing facilities.Research examined the anaerobic degradation of 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, metoprolol tartrate, and progesterone by methanogenic bacteria."
4414,"Using direct sample analysis and respirometric testing, anaerobic degradation was examined with (a) each compound as the sole organic carbon source and (b) each compound at a lower concentration (250 microg/L) and cellulose serving as the primary organic carbon source."
4415,"The change in pharmaceutical concentration was determined following 7, 28, 56, and 112 days of anaerobic incubation at 37 degrees C. Only acetylsalicylic acid demonstrated significant degradation; the remaining compounds showed a mixture of degradation and abiotic removal mechanisms."
4416,"Experimental results were compared with BIOWIN, an anaerobic degradation prediction model of the US Environmental Protection Agency."
4417,The BIOWIN model predicted anaerobic biodegradability of the compounds in the order: acetylsalicylic acid > metoprolol tartrate > ibuprofen > acetaminophen > 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol >progesterone.
4418,This corresponded well with the experimental findings which found degradability in the order: acetylsalicylic acid > metoprolol tartrate > acetaminophen > ibuprofen.The antiviral drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu) has received recent attention due to the potential use as a first-line defense against H5N1 and H1N1 influenza viruses.
4419,"Research has shown that oseltamivir is not removed during conventional wastewater treatments, thus having the potential to enter surface water bodies."
4420,A series of laboratory experiments investigated the fate and the removal of oseltamivir in two surface water ecosystems of Japan and in a municipal wastewater treatment plant located in Northern Italy.
4421,Persistence of oseltamivir in surface water ranged from non-detectable degradation to a half-life of 53d.
4422,"After 40d, <3% of radiolabeled oseltamivir evolved as (14)CO(2)."
4423,The presence of sediments (5%) led to a significant increase of oseltamivir degradation and mineralization rates.
4424,A more intense mineralization was observed in samples of the wastewater treatment plant when applying a long incubation period (40d).
4425,"More precisely, 76% and 37% of the initial radioactivity applied as (14)C-oseltamivir was recovered as (14)CO(2) from samples of the biological tank and effluent water, respectively."
4426,"Two bacterial strains growing on oseltamivir as sole carbon source were isolated and used for its removal from synthetic medium and environmental samples, including surface water and wastewater."
4427,"Inoculation of water and wastewater samples with the two oseltamivir-degrading strains showed that mineralization of oseltamivir was significantly higher in both inoculated water and wastewater, than in uninoculated controls."
4428,"Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitative PCR analysis showed that Tamiflu would not affect the microbial population of surface water and wastewater.A highly efficient carbendazim (methyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-ylcarbamate, or MBC)-mineralizing bacterium was isolated from enrichment cultures originating from MBC-contaminated soil samples."
4429,"This bacterium, Nocardioides sp."
4430,"strain SG-4G, hydrolyzed MBC to 2-aminobenzimidazole, which in turn was converted to the previously unknown metabolite 2-hydroxybenzimidazole."
4431,The initial steps of this novel metabolic pathway were confirmed by growth and enzyme assays and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) studies.
4432,The enzyme responsible for carrying out the first step was purified and subjected to N-terminal and internal peptide sequencing.
4433,"The cognate gene, named mheI (for MBC-hydrolyzing enzyme), was cloned using a reverse genetics approach."
4434,The MheI enzyme was found to be a serine hydrolase of 242 amino acid residues.
4435,Its nearest known relative is an uncharacterized hypothetical protein with only 40% amino acid identity to it.
4436,"Codon optimized mheI was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and the His-tagged enzyme was purified and biochemically characterized."
4437,"The enzyme has a K(m) and k(cat) of 6.1 muM and 170 min(-1), respectively, for MBC."
4438,"Radiation-killed, freeze-dried SG-4G cells showed strong and stable MBC detoxification activity suitable for use in enzymatic bioremediation applications.The rdpA and sdpA genes encode two enantioselective alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases catalyzing the initial step of microbial degradation of the chiral herbicide (R,S)-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propionate (R,S-dichlorprop)."
4439,Primers were designed to assess abundance and transcription dynamics of rdpA and sdpA genes in a natural agricultural soil.
4440,"No indigenous rdpA genes were detected, but sdpA genes were present at levels of approximately 10(3) copies g of soil(-1)."
4441,Cloning and sequencing of partial sdpA genes revealed a high diversity within the natural sdpA gene pool that could be divided into four clusters by phylogenetic analysis.
4442,"BLASTp analysis of deduced amino acids revealed that members of cluster I shared 68 to 69% identity, cluster II shared 78 to 85% identity, cluster III shared 58 to 64% identity, and cluster IV shared 55% identity to their closest SdpA relative in GenBank."
4443,"Expression of rdpA and sdpA in Delftia acidovorans MC1 inoculated in soil was monitored by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) during in situ degradation of 2 and 50 mg kg(-1) of (R,S)-dichlorprop."
4444,"(R,S)-Dichlorprop amendment created a clear upregulation of both rdpA and sdpA gene expression during the active phase of (14)C-labeled (R,S)-dichlorprop mineralization, particularly following the second dose of 50 mg kg(-1) herbicide."
4445,Expression of both genes was maintained at a low constitutive level in nonamended soil microcosms.
4446,"This study is the first to report the presence of indigenous sdpA genes recovered directly from natural soil and also comprises the first investigation into the transcription dynamics of two enantioselective dioxygenase genes during the in situ degradation of the herbicide (R,S)-dichlorprop in soil.With the intensive application of carbendazim in greenhouse production of vegetables and the production of medicinal herbs, there is an increasing need to find a way to remediate carbendazim-contaminated soil."
4447,A bacterial stain capable of utilizing carbendazim as the sole source of carbon and energy was isolated from soil.
4448,The isolate was designated CBW and identified as a member of Pseudomonas sp.
4449,"based on its colony morphology, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and Biolog analysis."
4450,"About 87.1 and 99.1% of carbendazim at concentrations of 1.0 and 10.0\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0l(-1) in mineral salts medium were removed by the isolate CBW after incubation for 3\xc2\xa0days, respectively."
4451,The optimal pH value for the isolate CBW to degrade carbendazim was 7.0.
4452,The degradation rate of carbendazim by the isolate CBW was found to increase slightly with temperature.
4453,"According to the metabolites detected and identified in the present study, it was proposed that carbendazim was first converted to 2-aminobenzimidazole, which was then transformed to 2-hydroxybenzimidazole, 1,2-diaminobenzene, catechol, and finally to carbon dioxide."
4454,"The results indicate that the isolate CBW is a new bacterial resource for biodegrading carbendazim and might be used for bioremediation of sites heavily contaminated by carbendazim and its derivatives.Five malathion-degrading bacterial strains were enriched and isolated from soil samples collected from different agricultural sites in Cairo, Egypt."
4455,"Malathion was used as a sole source of carbon (50\xc2\xa0mg/l) to enumerate malathion degraders, which were designated as IS1, IS2, IS3, IS4, and IS5."
4456,"They were identified, based on their morphological and biochemical characteristics, as Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Micrococcus lylae, Pseudomonas aureofaciens, and Acetobacter liquefaciens, respectively."
4457,"IS1 and IS2, which showed the highest degrading activity, were selected for further identification by partial sequence analysis of their 16S rRNA genes."
4458,"The 16S rRNA gene of IS1 shared 99% similarity with that of Alphaprotoebacterium BAL284, while IS2 scored 100% similarity with that of Pseudomonas putida 32zhy."
4459,Malathion residues almost completely disappeared within 6\xc2\xa0days of incubation in IS2 liquid cultures.
4460,"LC/ESI-MS analysis confirmed the degradation of malathion to malathion monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids, which formed as a result of carboxylesterase activity."
4461,A carboxylesterase gene (CE) was amplified from the IS2 genome by using specifically designed PCR primers.
4462,The sequence analysis showed a significant similarity to a known CE gene in different Pseudomonas sp.
4463,We report here the isolation of a new malathion-degrading bacteria from soils in Egypt that may be very well adapted to the climatic and environmental conditions of the country.
4464,We also report the partial cloning of a new CE gene.
4465,"Due to their high biodegradation activity, the bacteria isolated from this work merit further study as potential biological agents for the remediation of soil, water, or crops contaminated with the pesticide malathion.Phenoxyalkanoic herbicides such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-D), 2,4-dichlorophenoxybutyrate (2,4-DB) or mecoprop are widely used to control broad-leaf weeds."
4466,"Several bacteria have been reported to degrade these herbicides using the \xce\xb1-ketoglutarate-dependent, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate dioxygenase encoded by the tfdA gene, as the enzyme catalysing the first step in the catabolic pathway."
4467,The effects of exposure to different phenoxyalkanoic herbicides in the soil bacterial community and in the tfdA genes diversity were assessed using an agricultural soil exposed to these anthropogenic compounds.
4468,"Total community bacterial DNA was analysed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism of the 16S rRNA and the tfdA gene markers, and detection and cloning of tfdA gene related sequences, using PCR primer pairs."
4469,"After up to 4 months of herbicide exposure, significant changes in the bacterial community structure were detected in soil microcosms treated with mecoprop, 2,4-DB and a mixture of both plus 2,4-D. An impressive variety of novel tfdA gene related sequences were found in these soil microcosms, which cluster in new tfdA gene related sequence groups, unequally abundant depending on the specific herbicide used in soil treatment."
4470,Structural analysis of the putative protein products showed small but significant amino acid differences.
4471,"These tfdA gene sequence variants are, probably, required for degradation of natural substrate(s) structurally related to these herbicides and their presence explains self-remediation of soils exposed to phenoxyalkanoic herbicides.In the aerobic metabolism of aromatic substrates, oxygenases use molecular oxygen to hydroxylate and finally cleave the aromatic ring."
4472,"In the case of the common intermediate benzoate, the ring cleavage substrates are either catechol (in bacteria) or 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (protocatechuate, mainly in fungi)."
4473,"We have shown before that many bacteria, e.g."
4474,"Azoarcus evansii, the organism studied here, use a completely different mechanism."
4475,"This elaborate pathway requires formation of benzoyl-CoA, followed by an oxygenase reaction and a nonoxygenolytic ring cleavage."
4476,"Benzoyl-CoA transformation is catalyzed by the iron-containing benzoyl-CoA oxygenase (BoxB) in conjunction with an FAD and iron-sulfur centers containing reductase (BoxA), which donates electrons from NADPH."
4477,"Here we show that benzoyl-CoA oxygenase actually does not form the 2,3-dihydrodiol of benzoyl-CoA, as formerly postulated, but the 2,3-epoxide."
4478,"An enoyl-CoA hydratase (BoxC) uses two molecules of water to first hydrolytically open the ring of 2,3-epoxybenzoyl-CoA, which may proceed via its tautomeric seven-membered oxepin ring form."
4479,"Then ring C2 is hydrolyzed off as formic acid, yielding 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA semialdehyde."
4480,"The semialdehyde is oxidized by a NADP(+)-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (BoxD) to 3,4-dehydroadipyl-CoA."
4481,"Final products of the pathway are formic acid, acetyl-CoA, and succinyl-CoA."
4482,"This overlooked pathway occurs in 4-5% of all bacteria whose genomes have been sequenced and represents an elegant strategy to cope with the high resonance energy of aromatic substrates by forming a nonaromatic epoxide.Aromatic compounds constitute the second most abundant class of organic substrates and environmental pollutants, a substantial part of which (e.g., phenylalanine or styrene) is metabolized by bacteria via phenylacetate."
4483,"Surprisingly, the bacterial catabolism of phenylalanine and phenylacetate remained an unsolved problem."
4484,"Although a phenylacetate metabolic gene cluster had been identified, the underlying biochemistry remained largely unknown."
4485,"Here we elucidate the catabolic pathway functioning in 16% of all bacteria whose genome has been sequenced, including Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida."
4486,This strategy is exceptional in several aspects.
4487,"Intermediates are processed as CoA thioesters, and the aromatic ring of phenylacetyl-CoA becomes activated to a ring 1,2-epoxide by a distinct multicomponent oxygenase."
4488,"The reactive nonaromatic epoxide is isomerized to a seven-member O-heterocyclic enol ether, an oxepin."
4489,"This isomerization is followed by hydrolytic ring cleavage and beta-oxidation steps, leading to acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA."
4490,"This widespread paradigm differs significantly from the established chemistry of aerobic aromatic catabolism, thus widening our view of how organisms exploit such inert substrates."
4491,It provides insight into the natural remediation of man-made environmental contaminants such as styrene.
4492,"Furthermore, this pathway occurs in various pathogens, where its reactive early intermediates may contribute to virulence.We investigated the occurrence and fate of the two antiviral drugs oseltamivir carboxylate (OC)-the active metabolite of Tamiflu-and amantadine (AMT) at three sewage treatment plants (STPs) during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 influenza seasons in Japan."
4493,Both compounds were detected in all samples analyzed.
4494,The concentrations in raw influents at the STPs ranged from 140 to 460 ng L(-1) OC and from 184 to 538 ng L(-1) AMT.
4495,"Primary treatment gave no substantial removal of the drugs (OC, 2-9%; AMT, 7-17%)."
4496,"Biological nutrient-removal-based secondary treatment (anoxic-oxic-anoxic-oxic and anaerobic-anoxic-oxic) removed 20-37% of OC, whereas extended-aeration-based conventional activated sludge treatment removed <20%."
4497,STPs using primary plus biological secondary treatment removed <50% of the drugs.
4498,The incorporation of tertiary treatment by ozonation removed >90%.
4499,"Ozonation after secondary treatment in STPs will be necessary during an influenza pandemic to reduce the risks associated with the widespread use of antiviral drugs.During wastewater treatment, many organic micropollutants undergo microbially mediated reactions resulting in the formation of transformation products (TPs)."
4500,Little is known on the reaction pathways that govern these transformations or on the occurrence of microbial TPs in surface waters.
4501,Large sets of biotransformation data for organic micropollutants would be useful for assessing the exposure potential of these TPs and for enabling the development of structure-based biotransformation prediction tools.
4502,The objective of this work was to develop an efficient procedure to allow for high-throughput elucidation of TP structures for a broad and diverse set of xenobiotics undergoing microbially mediated transformation reactions.
4503,Six pharmaceuticals and six pesticides were spiked individually into batch reactors seeded with activated sludge.
4504,Samples from the reactors were separated with HPLC and analyzed by linear ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometry.
4505,Candidate TPs were preliminarily identified with an innovative post-acquisition data processing method based on target and non-target screenings of the full-scan MS data.
4506,Structures were proposed following interpretation of MS spectra and MS/MS fragments.
4507,"Previously unreported microbial TPs were identified for the pharmaceuticals bezafibrate, diazepam, levetiracetam, oseltamivir, and valsartan."
4508,A variety of previously reported and unreported TPs were identified for the pesticides.
4509,The results showed that the complementary use of the target and non-target screening methods allowed for a more comprehensive interpretation of the TPs generated than either would have provided individually.Tenofovir (9-(R)-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)-adenine) is an antiretroviral drug widely used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections.
4510,Tenofovir is extensively and rapidly excreted unchanged in the urine.
4511,"In the expectation that tenofovir could potentially reach agricultural lands through the application of municipal biosolids or wastewater, and in the absence of any environmental fate data, we evaluated its persistence in selected agricultural soils."
4512,"Less than 10% of -tenofovir added to soils varying widely in texture (sand, loam, clay loam) was mineralized in a 2-month incubation under laboratory conditions."
4513,Tenofovir was less readily extractable from clay soils than from a loam or a sandy loam soil.
4514,Radioactive residues of tenofovir were removed from the soil extractable fraction with DT(50)s ranging from 24\xc2\xb12 to 67+22days (first order kinetic model) or 44+9 to 127+55days (zero order model).
4515,No extractable transformation products were detectable by HPLC.
4516,"Tenofovir mineralization in the loam soil increased with temperature (range 4\xc2\xb0C to 30\xc2\xb0C), and did not occur in autoclaved soil, suggesting a microbial basis."
4517,"Mineralization rates increased with soil moisture content, ranging from air-dried to saturated."
4518,"In summary, tenofovir was relatively persistent in soils, there were no extractable transformation products detected, and the response of -tenofovir mineralization to soil temperature and heat sterilization indicated that the molecule was biodegraded by aerobic microorganisms."
4519,Sorption isotherms with dewatered biosolids suggested that tenofovir residues could potentially partition into the particulate fraction during sewage treatment.We isolated three Sphingobium fuliginis strains from Phragmites australis rhizosphere sediment that were capable of utilizing 4-tert-butylphenol as a sole carbon and energy source.
4520,These strains are the first 4-tert-butylphenol-utilizing bacteria.
4521,"The strain designated TIK-1 completely degraded 1.0 mM 4-tert-butylphenol in basal salts medium within 12 h, with concomitant cell growth."
4522,"We identified 4-tert-butylcatechol and 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone as internal metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry."
4523,"When 3-fluorocatechol was used as an inactivator of meta-cleavage enzymes, strain TIK-1 could not degrade 4-tert-butylcatechol and 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone was not detected."
4524,"We concluded that metabolism of 4-tert-butylphenol by strain TIK-1 is initiated by hydroxylation to 4-tert-butylcatechol, followed by a meta-cleavage pathway."
4525,"Growth experiments with 20 other alkylphenols showed that 4-isopropylphenol, 4-sec-butylphenol, and 4-tert-pentylphenol, which have alkyl side chains of three to five carbon atoms with \xce\xb1-quaternary or \xce\xb1-tertiary carbons, supported cell growth but that 4-n-alkylphenols, 4-tert-octylphenol, technical nonylphenol, 2-alkylphenols, and 3-alkylphenols did not."
4526,The rate of growth on 4-tert-butylphenol was much higher than that of growth on the other alkylphenols.
4527,"Degradation experiments with various alkylphenols showed that strain TIK-1 cells grown on 4-tert-butylphenol could degrade 4-alkylphenols with variously sized and branched side chains (ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, tert-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, tert-octyl, n-nonyl, and branched nonyl) via a meta-cleavage pathway but not 2- or 3-alkylphenols."
4528,"Along with the degradation of these alkylphenols, we detected methyl alkyl ketones that retained the structure of the original alkyl side chains."
4529,"Strain TIK-1 may be useful in the bioremediation of environments polluted by 4-tert-butylphenol and various other 4-alkylphenols.Groundwater quality effects from septic tanks were investigated in the Woodville Karst Plain, an area that contains numerous sinkholes and a thin veneer of sands and clays overlying the Upper Floridan aquifer (UFA)."
4530,"Concerns have emerged about elevated nitrate concentrations in the UFA, which is the source of water supply in this area of northern Florida."
4531,"At three sites during dry and wet periods in 2007-2008, water samples were collected from the septic tank, shallow and deep lysimeters, and drainfield and background wells in the UFA and analyzed for multiple chemical indicators including nutrients, nitrate isotopes, organic wastewater compounds (OWCs), pharmaceutical compounds, and microbiological indicators (bacteria and viruses)."
4532,Median NO3-N concentration in groundwater beneath the septic tank drainfields was 20 mg L(-1) (8.0-26 mg L(-1)).
4533,"After adjusting for dilution, about 25 to 40% N loss (from denitrification, ammonium sorption, and ammonia volatilization) occurs as septic tank effluent moves through the unsaturated zone to the water table."
4534,"Nitrogen loading rates to groundwater were highly variable at each site (3.9-12 kg N yr(-1)), as were N and chloride depth profiles in the unsaturated zone."
4535,"Most OWCs and pharmaceutical compounds were highly attenuated beneath the drainfields; however, five Cs (caffeine, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, phenol, galaxolide, and tris(dichloroisotopropyl)phosphate) and two pharmaceutical compounds (acetaminophen and sulfamethoxazole) were detected in groundwater samples."
4536,Indicator bacteria and human enteric viruses were detected in septic tank effluent samples but only intermittently in soil water and groundwater.
4537,Contaminant movement to groundwater beneath each septic tank system also was related to water use and differences in lithology at each site.A novel actinobacterial strain Rhodococcus jialingiae djl-6-2 capable of using carbendazim (MBC) as the sole carbon and nitrogen source for growth was used to investigate its metabolism pathway of MBC.
4538,The HPLC and MS/MS analysis showed that MBC was hydrolyzed to 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-AB) and then converted to benzimidazole or 2-hydroxybenzimidazole (2-HB).
4539,The conversion of 2-AB was inhibited by NH(4)NO(3).
4540,The benzene ring of 2-HB was further opened through meta (extradiol) catechol cleavage.
4541,"The inoculation of strain djl-6-2 to MBC-contaminated soil resulted in a higher degradation rate than noninoculated soil, which indicated the potential of strain djl-6-2 in bioremediation of MBC polluted soil.The 2009-2010 influenza pandemic saw many people treated with antivirals and antibiotics."
4542,High proportions of both classes of drugs are excreted and enter wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in biologically active forms.
4543,"To date, there has been no study into the potential for influenza pandemic-scale pharmaceutical use to disrupt WWTP function."
4544,"Furthermore, there is currently little indication as to whether WWTP microbial consortia can degrade antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors when exposed to pandemic-scale doses."
4545,"In this study, we exposed an aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor, operated for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), to a simulated influenza-pandemic dosing of antibiotics and antivirals for 8 weeks."
4546,"We monitored the removal of the active form of Tamiflu(\xc2\xae), oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), bacterial community structure, granule structure and changes in EBPR and nitrification performance."
4547,There was little removal of OC by sludge and no evidence that the activated sludge community adapted to degrade OC.
4548,There was evidence of changes to the bacterial community structure and disruption to EBPR and nitrification during and after high-OC dosing.
4549,This work highlights the potential for the antiviral contamination of receiving waters and indicates the risk of destabilizing WWTP microbial consortia as a result of high concentrations of bioactive pharmaceuticals during an influenza pandemic.Real-time PCR and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) approaches that specifically target the Variovorax 16S rRNA gene were developed to estimate the number and diversity of Variovorax in environmental ecosystems.
4550,PCR primers suitable for both methods were selected as such that the enclosed sequence showed maximum polymorphism.
4551,PCR specificity was maximized by combining PCR with a targeted endonuclease treatment of template DNA to eliminate 16S rRNA genes of the closely related Acidovorax.
4552,DGGE allowed the grouping of PCR amplicons according to the phylogenetic grouping within the genus Variovorax.
4553,The toolbox was used to assess the Variovorax community dynamics in agricultural soil microcosms (SMs) exposed to the phenylurea herbicide linuron.
4554,Exposure to linuron resulted in an increased abundance within the Variovorax community of a subgroup previously linked to linuron degradation through cultivation-dependent isolation.
4555,SMs that were treated only once with linuron reverted to the initial community composition 70 days after linuron exposure.
4556,"In contrast, SMs irrigated with linuron on a long-term base showed a significant increase in Variovorax number after 70 days."
4557,Our data support the hypothesis that the genus Variovorax is involved in linuron degradation in linuron-treated agricultural soils.Triazophos is one of the most widely used organophosphorus insecticides usually detectable in the environment.
4558,"A bacterial strain, Diaphorobacter sp."
4559,"TPD-1, capable of using triazophos and its intermediate, 1-phenyl-3-hydroxy-1,2,4-triazole (PHT), as its sole carbon sources for growth was isolated from a triazophos-contaminated soil in China."
4560,"This strain could completely degrade 50 mg l(-1) triazophos and PHT to non-detectable level in 24 and 56 h, respectively."
4561,"During PHT degradation, three metabolites were detected and identified based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis."
4562,"Using this information, a biochemical degradation pathway of triazophos by Diaphorobacter sp."
4563,TPD-1 was proposed.
4564,"The first step involved in the degradation of triazophos is the hydrolysis of the P-O ester bond of triazophos to form PHT and o,o-diethyl phosphorothioic acid, then the triazol ring of PHT is subsequently cleaved to form (E)-1-formyl-2-phenyldiazene."
4565,"Subsequently, (E)-1-formyl-2-phenyldiazene is transformed to 2-phenylhydrazinecarboxylic acid by adding one molecular of H(2)O."
4566,"Finally, the carboxyl group of 2-phenylhydrazinecarboxylic acid is decarboxylated to form phenylhydrazine.2-Methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) is a widely used phenoxyalkanoic acid herbicide and subject to aerobic microbial degradation."
4567,Earthworms stimulate both growth and activity of MCPA-degrading bacteria in soil.
4568,"Thus, active MCPA degraders in soil and drilosphere (i.e."
4569,"burrow walls, gut content and cast) were assessed by 16S rRNA stable isotope probing in soil columns under experimental conditions designed to minimize laboratory incubation biases."
4570,Agriculturally relevant concentrations of MCPA (20 \xc2\xb5g g(dw) (-1)) were degraded in soil within 23 and 27 days in the presence and absence of earthworms respectively.
4571,"Total 16S rRNA analysis revealed 73 operational taxonomic units indicative of active Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia in soil and drilosphere derived material."
4572,"Seven operational taxonomic units indicative of Alpha-, Beta-, Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes consumed MCPA-."
4573,Dominant consumers of MCPA- were Alphaproteobacteria (Sphingomonadaceae and Bradyrhizobiaceae) in soil and drilosphere.
4574,"Beta- (Comamonadaceae) and Gammaproteobacteria (Xanthomonadaceae) were also important MCPA- consumers in burrow walls only, indicating that earthworms favour betaproteobacterial MCPA degraders."
4575,"In oxic microcosms with bulk soil, burrow walls and cast, 20 and 300-400 \xc2\xb5g g(dw) (-1) MCPA were consumed within 24 h and 20 days respectively."
4576,Gut contents did not facilitate the degradation of MCPA.
4577,"Sphingomonadaceae dominated MCPA- consumers in bulk soil and burrow wall microcosms, while Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria (Burkholderiacea, Comamonadaceae, Oxalobacteraceae and Xanthomonadaceae) dominated MCPA- consumers in microcosms of cast, indicating that the latter taxa are prone to respond to MCPA in cast."
4578,The collective data indicated that Alphaproteobacteria are major MCPA degraders in soil and drilosphere.Nitrate is a key node in the network of the assimilatory and respiratory nitrogen pathways.
4579,"As one of the \'fixed\' forms of nitrogen, nitrate plays an essential role in both nature and industry."
4580,"For bacteria, it is both a nitrogen source and an electron acceptor."
4581,"In agriculture and wastewater treatment, nitrate respiration by microorganisms is an important issue with respect to economics, greenhouse gas emission and public health."
4582,"Several microbial processes compete for nitrate: denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and anaerobic ammonium oxidation."
4583,"In this review we provide an up to date overview of the organisms, genes and enzymes involved in nitrate respiration."
4584,We also address the molecular detection of these processes in nature.
4585,"We show that despite rapid progress in the experimental and genomic analyses of pure cultures, knowledge on the mechanism of nitrate reduction in natural ecosystems is still largely lacking.The neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir are the first-line of defense against potentially fatal variants of influenza A pandemic strains."
4586,"However, if resistant virus strains start to arise easily or at a high frequency, a new anti-influenza strategy will be necessary."
4587,This study aimed to investigate if and to what extent NA inhibitor-resistant mutants exist in the wild population of influenza A viruses that inhabit wild birds.
4588,"NA sequences of all NA subtypes available from 5490 avian, 379 swine and 122 environmental isolates were extracted from NCBI databases."
4589,"In addition, a dataset containing 230 virus isolates from mallard collected at Ottenby Bird Observatory (\xc3\x96land, Sweden) was analyzed."
4590,"Isolated NA RNA fragments from Ottenby were transformed to cDNA by RT-PCR, which was followed by sequencing."
4591,The analysis of genotypic profiles for NAs from both data sets in regard to antiviral resistance mutations was performed using bioinformatics tools.
4592,"All 6221 sequences were scanned for oseltamivir- (I117V, E119V, D198N, I222V, H274Y, R292K, N294S and I314V) and zanamivir-related mutations (V116A, R118K, E119G/A/D, Q136K, D151E, R152K, R224K, E276D, R292K and R371K)."
4593,"Of the sequences from the avian NCBI dataset, 132 (2.4%) carried at least one, or in two cases even two and three, NA inhibitor resistance mutations."
4594,"Swine and environmental isolates from the same data set had 18 (4.75%) and one (0.82%) mutant, respectively, with at least one mutation."
4595,The Ottenby sequences carried at least one mutation in 15 cases (6.52%).
4596,"Therefore, resistant strains were more frequently found in Ottenby samples than in NCBI data sets."
4597,"However, it is still uncertain if these mutations are the result of natural variations in the viruses or if they are induced by the selective pressure of xenobiotics (e.g., oseltamivir, zanamivir).The biotransformation of the two antiviral drugs, acyclovir (ACV) and penciclovir (PCV), was investigated in contact with activated sludge."
4598,"Biodegradation kinetics were determined, and transformation products (TPs) were identified using Hybrid Linear Ion Trap- FT Mass Spectrometry (LTQ Orbitrap Velos) and 1D (1H NMR, 13C NMR) and 2D (1H,1H-COSY, 1H-(13)C-HSQC) NMR Spectroscopy."
4599,"ACV and PCV rapidly dissipated in the activated sludge batch systems with half-lives of 5.3 and 3.4 h and first-order rate constants in relation to the amount of suspended solids (SS) of 4.9\xc2\xb10.1 L gss(-1) d(-1) and 7.6\xc2\xb10.3 L gss(-1) d(-1), respectively."
4600,"For ACV only a single TP was found, whereas eight TPs were identified for PCV."
4601,Structural elucidation of TPs exhibited that transformation only took place at the side chain leaving the guanine moiety unaltered.
4602,The oxidation of the primary hydroxyl group in ACV resulted in the formation of carboxy-acyclovir (Carboxy-ACV).
4603,"For PCV, transformation was more diverse with several enzymatic reactions taking place such as the oxidation of terminal hydroxyl groups and \xce\xb2-oxidation followed by acetate cleavage."
4604,"Analysis of different environmental samples revealed the presence of Carboxy-ACV in surface and drinking water with concentrations up to 3200 ng L(-1) and 40 ng L(-1), respectively.4-Nitrophenol (4-NP) is a toxic compound formed in soil by the hydrolysis of organophosphorous pesticides, such as parathion."
4605,We previously reported the presence of the 4-NP degradation gene cluster (nphRA1A2) in Rhodococcus sp.
4606,"strain PN1, which encodes a two-component 4-NP hydroxylase system that oxidizes 4-NP into 4-nitrocatechol."
4607,"In the current study, another gene cluster (npsC and npsRA2A1B) encoding a similar 4-NP hydroxylase system was cloned from strain PN1."
4608,The enzymes from this 4-NP hydroxylase system (NpsA1 and NpsA2) were purified as histidine-tagged (His-) proteins and then characterized.
4609,"His-NpsA2 showed NADH/FAD oxidoreductase activity, and His-NpsA1 showed 4-NP oxidizing activity in the presence of His-NpsA2."
4610,"In the 4-NP oxidation using the reconstituted enzyme system (His-NpsA1 and His-NpsA2), hydroquinone (35% of 4-NP disappeared) and hydroxyquinol (59% of 4-NP disappeared) were detected in the presence of ascorbic acid as a reducing reagent, suggesting that, without the reducing reagent, 4-NP was converted into their oxidized forms, 1,4-benzoquinone and 2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone."
4611,"In addition, in the cell extract of recombinant Escherichia coli expressing npsB, a typical spectral change showing conversion of hydroxyquinol into maleylacetate was observed."
4612,"These results indicate that this nps gene cluster, in addition to the nph gene cluster, is also involved in 4-NP degradation in strain PN1.We investigated the effect of (R,S)-dichlorprop herbicide addition to soil microcosms on the degrading indigenous microbial community by targeting multiple \xce\xb1-ketoglutarate-dependent (\xce\xb1-KG) dioxygenase-encoding genes (rdpA, sdpA and tfdA group I) at both gene and transcript level."
4613,The soil microbial community responded with high growth of potential degraders as measured by the abundance of dioxygenase-encoding genes using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR).
4614,rdpA DNA was not detectable in unamended soil but reached over 10\xe2\x81\xb6 copies g\xe2\x81\xbb\xc2\xb9 soil after amendment.
4615,"sdpA and tfdA were both present prior to amendment at levels of ~5 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x81\xb4 and ~ 10\xc2\xb2 copies g\xe2\x81\xbb\xc2\xb9 soil, respectively, and both reached over 10\xe2\x81\xb5copies g\xe2\x81\xbb\xc2\xb9 soil."
4616,"While expression of all three target genes was detected during two cycles of herbicide degradation, a time-shift occurred between maximum expression of each gene."
4617,Gene diversity by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) uncovered a diversity of sdpA and tfdA genes at the DNA level while rdpA remained highly conserved.
4618,"However, mRNA profiles indicated that all transcribed tfdA sequences were class III genes while rdpA transcripts shared 100% identity to rdpA of Delftia acidovorans MC1 and sdpA transcripts shared 100% identity to sdpA from Sphingomonas herbicidovorans MH."
4619,This is the first report to describe expression dynamics of multiple \xce\xb1-KG dioxygenase-encoding genes in the indigenous microbial community as related to degradation of a phenoxypropionate herbicide in soil.We evaluated the effects of variations in atrazine input on the evolution of a bacterial culture adapted to a low atrazine concentration.
4620,This initial culture (M3-K) was subjected to weekly subculturing in the presence of a high concentration of atrazine as the only N source (100 mg l(-1)).
4621,"After four subculturing, M3-K evolved to a new bacterial culture (M3) which exhibited a significant increase in the extent of atrazine mineralization in comparison with the initial culture."
4622,"Molecular analyses of M3-K and M3 cultures by cloning, restriction analysis, and sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes revealed significant differences in culture structure and composition."
4623,"M3-K culture comprised mainly Actinobacteria (40%), \xce\xb2-Proteobacteria (26%), and Bacteroidetes (16%)."
4624,"After exposure to a high atrazine concentration, the dominance of Actinobacteria decreased (14%), Bacteroidetes increased (27%), and \xce\xb2-Proteobacteria were replaced by \xce\xb3-Proteobacteria (32%)."
4625,"Quantitative PCR revealed that the abundance of atzB and atzC genes relative to total bacteria decreased by a factor of 3-4 following the increase in atrazine concentration, while the relative abundance of trzD increased significantly (\xe2\x89\x88400 times)."
4626,Presented study shows that variations in atrazine input drive both functional and compositional shifts in the atrazine-degrading bacterial culture.Chlorophenols are chlorinated aromatic compound structures and are commonly found in pesticide preparations as well as industrial wastes.
4627,They are recalcitrant to biodegradation and consequently persistent in the environment.
4628,"A variety of chlorophenols derivatives compounds are highly toxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic for living organisms."
4629,Biological transformation by microorganisms is one of the key remediation options that can be exploited to solve environmental pollution problems caused by these notorious compounds.
4630,The key enzymes in the microbial degradation of chlorophenols are the oxygenases and dioxygenases.
4631,These enzymes can be engineered for enhanced degradation of highly chlorinated aromatic compounds through directed evolution methods.
4632,This review underscores the mechanisms of chlorophenols biodegradation with the view to understanding how bioremediation processes can be optimized for cleaning up chloroaromatic contaminated environments.Pharmaceuticals are an integral part of a dignified life.
4633,"However, a lack of degradability and threats to the welfare of living beings cause concern due to their emission into the environment."
4634,There is also a lack of knowledge about cause and consequence.
4635,"Therefore, we intend to contribute to the development of educational programmes which should increasingly include the topic \'pharmaceuticals in the environment\'.To assess the concentration of atrazine in Lake Oconee and develop a qPCR assay as a potential marker for the presence of atrazine-degrading bacteria indicating atrazine contamination.Two distinct microbial processes, denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), are responsible for the release of fixed nitrogen as dinitrogen gas (N(2)) to the atmosphere."
4636,Denitrification has been studied for over 100 years and its intermediates and enzymes are well known.
4637,"Even though anammox is a key biogeochemical process of equal importance, its molecular mechanism is unknown, but it was proposed to proceed through hydrazine (N(2)H(4))."
4638,Here we show that N(2)H(4) is produced from the anammox substrates ammonium and nitrite and that nitric oxide (NO) is the direct precursor of N(2)H(4).
4639,We resolved the genes and proteins central to anammox metabolism and purified the key enzymes that catalyse N(2)H(4) synthesis and its oxidation to N(2).
4640,These results present a new biochemical reaction forging an N-N bond and fill a lacuna in our understanding of the biochemical synthesis of the N(2) in the atmosphere.
4641,"Furthermore, they reinforce the role of nitric oxide in the evolution of the nitrogen cycle.In our previous study, the isoproturon-degrading strain Sphingomonas sp."
4642,Y57 was isolated from the wastewater treatment system of an herbicide factory.
4643,"Interestingly, this strain also showed the ability to degrade propanil (3,4-dichloropropionamilide)."
4644,"The present work reveals that Y57 degrades propanil via the following pathway: propanil was initially hydrolyzed to 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) and then converted to 4,5-dichlorocatechol, which was then subjected to aromatic ring cleavage and further processing."
4645,"N-acylation and N-deacylation of 3,4-DCA also occurred, and among N-acylation products, 3,4-dichloropropionanilide was found for the first time."
4646,"The gene encoding the propanil hydrolase responsible for transforming propanil into 3,4-DCA was cloned from Y57 and was designated as prpH."
4647,PrpH was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography.
4648,PrpH displayed the highest activity against propanil at 40\xc2\xb0C and at pH 7.0.
4649,The effect of metal ions on the propanil-degrading activity of PrpH was also determined.
4650,"To our knowledge, this is the first report of a strain that can degrade both propanil and 3,4-DCA and the first identification of a gene encoding a propanil hydrolase in bacteria.The soil bacterial isolate Variovorax sp."
4651,strain SRS16 mineralizes the phenylurea herbicide linuron.
4652,"The proposed pathway initiates with hydrolysis of linuron to 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA) and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine, followed by conversion of DCA to Krebs cycle intermediates."
4653,"Differential proteomic analysis showed a linuron-dependent upregulation of several enzymes that fit into this pathway, including an amidase (LibA), a multicomponent chloroaniline dioxygenase, and enzymes associated with a modified chlorocatechol ortho-cleavage pathway."
4654,"Purified LibA is a monomeric linuron hydrolase of \xe2\x88\xbc55 kDa with a K(m) and a V(max) for linuron of 5.8 \xce\xbcM and 0.16 nmol min\xe2\x81\xbb\xc2\xb9, respectively."
4655,This novel member of the amidase signature family is unrelated to phenylurea-hydrolyzing enzymes from Gram-positive bacteria and lacks activity toward other tested phenylurea herbicides.
4656,"Orthologues of libA are present in all other tested linuron-degrading Variovorax strains with the exception of Variovorax strains WDL1 and PBS-H4, suggesting divergent evolution of the linuron catabolic pathway in different Variovorax strains."
4657,The organization of the linuron degradation genes identified in the draft SRS16 genome sequence indicates that gene patchwork assembly is at the origin of the pathway.
4658,"Transcription analysis suggests that a catabolic intermediate, rather than linuron itself, acts as effector in activation of the pathway."
4659,Our study provides the first report on the genetic organization of a bacterial pathway for complete mineralization of a phenylurea herbicide and the first report on a linuron hydrolase in Gram-negative bacteria.A metagenomic analysis of two aquifer systems located under a dairy farming region was performed to examine to what extent the composition and function of microbial communities varies between confined and surface-influenced unconfined groundwater ecosystems.
4660,"A fundamental shift in taxa was seen with an overrepresentation of Rhodospirillales, Rhodocyclales, Chlorobia and Circovirus in the unconfined aquifer, while Deltaproteobacteria and Clostridiales were overrepresented in the confined aquifer."
4661,"A relative overrepresentation of metabolic processes including antibiotic resistance (\xce\xb2-lactamase genes), lactose and glucose utilization and DNA replication were observed in the unconfined aquifer, while flagella production, phosphate metabolism and starch uptake pathways were all overrepresented in the confined aquifer."
4662,These differences were likely driven by differences in the nutrient status and extent of exposure to contaminants of the two groundwater systems.
4663,"However, when compared with freshwater, ocean, sediment and animal gut metagenomes, the unconfined and confined aquifers were taxonomically and metabolically more similar to each other than to any other environment."
4664,"This suggests that intrinsic features of groundwater ecosystems, including low oxygen levels and a lack of sunlight, have provided specific niches for evolution to create unique microbial communities."
4665,Obtaining a broader understanding of the structure and function of microbial communities inhabiting different groundwater systems is particularly important given the increased need for managing groundwater reserves of potable water.The natural processes occurring in subsurface environments have proven to effectively remove a number of organic pollutants from water.
4666,The predominant redox conditions revealed to be one of the controlling factors.
4667,"However, in the case of organic micropollutants the knowledge on this potential redox-dependent behavior is still limited."
4668,"Motivated by managed aquifer recharge practices microcosm experiments involving aquifer material, settings potentially feasible in field applications, and organic micropollutants at environmental concentrations were carried out."
4669,Different anaerobic redox conditions were promoted and sustained in each set of microcosms by adding adequate quantities of electron donors and acceptors.
4670,"Whereas denitrification and sulfate-reducing conditions are easily achieved and maintained, Fe- and Mn-reduction are strongly constrained by the slower dissolution of the solid phases commonly present in aquifers."
4671,"The thorough description and numerical modeling of the evolution of the experiments, including major and trace solutes and dissolution/precipitation of solid phases, have been proven necessary to the understanding of the processes and closing the mass balance."
4672,"As an example of micropollutant results, the ubiquitous beta-blocker atenolol is completely removed in the experiments, the removal occurring faster under more advanced redox conditions."
4673,"This suggests that aquifers constitute a potentially efficient alternative water treatment for atenolol, especially if adequate redox conditions are promoted during recharge and long enough residence times are ensured.The dynamics of the atrazine mineralization potential in agricultural soil was studied in two soil layers (topsoil and at 35-45 cm depth) in a 3 years field trial to examine the long term response of atrazine mineralizing soil populations to atrazine application and intermittent periods without atrazine and the effect of manure treatment on those processes."
4674,"In topsoil samples, (14)C-atrazine mineralization lag times decreased after atrazine application and increased with increasing time after atrazine application, suggesting that atrazine application resulted into the proliferation of atrazine mineralizing microbial populations which decayed when atrazine application stopped."
4675,Decay rates appeared however much slower than growth rates.
4676,Atrazine application also resulted into the increase of the atrazine mineralization potential in deeper layers which was explained by the growth on leached atrazine as measured in soil leachates recovered from that depth.
4677,"However, no decay was observed during intermittent periods without atrazine application in the deeper soil layer."
4678,atzA and trzN gene quantification confirmed partly the growth and decay of the atrazine degrading populations in the soil and suggested that especially trzN bearing populations are the dominant atrazine degrading populations in both topsoil and deeper soil.
4679,Manure treatment only improved the atrazine mineralization rate in deeper soil layers.
4680,Our results point to the importance of the atrazine application history on a field and suggests that the long term survival of atrazine degrading populations after atrazine application enables them to rapidly proliferate once atrazine is again applied.This paper provides a review of the types of emerging organic groundwater contaminants (EGCs) which are beginning to be found in the UK.
4681,"EGCs are compounds being found in groundwater that were previously not detectable or known to be significant and can come from agricultural, urban and rural point sources."
4682,"EGCs include nanomaterials, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial compounds, personal care products, fragrances, water treatment by-products, flame retardants and surfactants, as well as caffeine and nicotine."
4683,Many are relatively small polar molecules which may not be effectively removed by drinking water treatment.
4684,"Data from the UK Environment Agency\'s groundwater screening programme for organic pollutants found within the 30 most frequently detected compounds a number of EGCs such as pesticide metabolites, caffeine and DEET."
4685,"Specific determinands frequently detected include pesticides metabolites, pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine and triclosan, nicotine, food additives and alkyl phosphates."
4686,"This paper discusses the routes by which these compounds enter groundwater, their toxicity and potential risks to drinking water and the environment."
4687,It identifies challenges that need to be met to minimise risk to drinking water and ecosystems.De-esterification is an important degradation or detoxification mechanism of sulfonylurea herbicide in microbes and plants.
4688,"However, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of sulfonylurea herbicide de-esterification are still unknown."
4689,"In this study, a novel esterase gene, sulE, responsible for sulfonylurea herbicide de-esterification, was cloned from Hansschlegelia zhihuaiae S113."
4690,"The gene contained an open reading frame of 1,194 bp, and a putative signal peptide at the N terminal was identified with a predicted cleavage site between Ala37 and Glu38, resulting in a 361-residue mature protein."
4691,SulE minus the signal peptide was synthesized in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified to homogeneity.
4692,SulE catalyzed the de-esterification of a variety of sulfonylurea herbicides that gave rise to the corresponding herbicidally inactive parent acid and exhibited the highest catalytic efficiency toward thifensulfuron-methyl.
4693,SulE was a dimer without the requirement of a cofactor.
4694,"The activity of the enzyme was completely inhibited by Ag(+), Cd(2+), Zn(2+), methamidophos, and sodium dodecyl sulfate."
4695,"A sulE-disrupted mutant strain, \xce\x94sulE, was constructed by insertion mutation."
4696,"\xce\x94sulE lost the de-esterification ability and was more sensitive to the herbicides than the wild type of strain S113, suggesting that sulE played a vital role in the sulfonylurea herbicide resistance of the strain."
4697,The transfer of sulE into Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 conferred on it the ability to de-esterify sulfonylurea herbicides and increased its resistance to the herbicides.
4698,"This study has provided an excellent candidate for the mechanistic study of sulfonylurea herbicide metabolism and detoxification through de-esterification, construction of sulfonylurea herbicide-resistant transgenic crops, and bioremediation of sulfonylurea herbicide-contaminated environments.An anaerobic microbial community was enriched in a chemostat that was operated for more than 8 years with benzene and nitrate as electron acceptor."
4699,"The coexistence of multiple species in the chemostat and the presence of a biofilm, led to the hypothesis that benzene-degrading species coexist in a syntrophic interaction, and that benzene can be degraded in syntrophy by consortia with various electron acceptors in the same culture."
4700,"The benzene-degrading microorganisms were identified by DNA-stable isotope probing with -labelled benzene, and the effect of different electron donors and acceptors on benzene degradation was investigated."
4701,The degradation rate constant of benzene with nitrate (0.7 day(-1) ) was higher than reported previously.
4702,"In the absence of nitrate, the microbial community was able to use sulfate, chlorate or ferric iron as electron acceptor."
4703,"Bacteria belonging to the Peptococcaceae were identified as dominant benzene consumers, but also those related to Rhodocyclaceae and Burkholderiaceae were found to be associated with the anaerobic benzene degradation process."
4704,The benzene degradation activity in the chemostat was associated with microbial growth in biofilms.
4705,"This, together with the inhibiting effect of hydrogen and the ability to degrade benzene with different electron acceptors, suggests that benzene was degraded via a syntrophic process.Dewatered municipal biosolids (DMBs) were applied to a field at a rate of ~22 Mg dw ha(-1) in October 2008."
4706,"Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were monitored in groundwater, tile drainage, soil, DMB aggregates incorporated into the soil post-land application, and in the grain of wheat grown on the field for a period of ~1 year following application."
4707,Over 80 PPCPs were analyzed in the source DMB.
4708,"PPCPs selected for in-depth monitoring included: antibiotics (tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones), bacteriocides (triclosan, triclocarban), beta-blockers (atenolol, propranolol, metaprolol), antidepressants (fluoxetine, citalopram, venlafaxine, sertraline), antifungals (miconazole), analgesics (acetaminophen, ibuprofen) and anticonvulsants (carbamazepine)."
4709,"PPCPs in tile were observed twice, ~3 weeks and 2 months post-application."
4710,"Of all PPCPs measured in tile drainage, only carbamazepine, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, triclosan, triclocarban, venlafaxine, and citalopram were detected (5-74 ng L(-1))."
4711,"PPCPs were not detected in groundwater >2 m depth below the soil surface, and concentrations above detection limits at 2 m depth were only observed once just after the first rain event post-application."
4712,"In groundwater, all compounds found in tile, except carbamazepine, acetaminophen and citalopram, were detected (10-19 ng L(-1))."
4713,"PPCPs were detected in DMB aggregates incorporated in soil up to 1 year post-application, with miconazole and fluoxetine having the lowest percent reductions over 1 year (~50%)."
4714,"For several compounds in these aggregates, concentration declines were of exponential decay form."
4715,No PPCPs were detected in the grain of wheat planted post-application on the field.
4716,"No PPCPs were ever detected in water, soil or grain samples from the reference plot, where no DMB was applied.Emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) detected in groundwater may have adverse effects on human health and aquatic ecosystems."
4717,"This paper reviews the existing occurrence data in groundwater for a range of EOCs including pharmaceutical, personal care, \'life-style\' and selected industrial compounds."
4718,"The main sources and pathways for organic EOCs in groundwater are reviewed, with occurrence data for EOCs in groundwater included from both targeted studies and broad reconnaissance surveys."
4719,Nanogram-microgram per litre concentrations are present in groundwater for a large range of EOCs as well as metabolites and transformation products and under certain conditions may pose a threat to freshwater bodies for decades due to relatively long groundwater residence times.
4720,"In the coming decades, more of these EOCs are likely to have drinking water standards, environmental quality standards and/or groundwater threshold values defined, and therefore a better understanding of the spatial and temporal variation remains a priority.libA, a gene encoding a novel type of linuron hydrolase, was recently identified in the linuron-mineralizing Variovorax sp."
4721,strain SRS16.
4722,"In order to assess the contribution of libA to linuron degradation in environmental settings, libA abundance was monitored in response to the application of linuron and to environmental perturbations in agricultural soil microcosms and microcosms simulating the matrix of on-farm biopurification systems."
4723,libA numbers were measured by real-time PCR and linked to reported data of Variovorax community composition and linuron mineralization capacity.
4724,"In the soil microcosms and one biopurification system setup, libA numbers responded to the application of linuron and environmental changes in congruency with the modulation of linuron mineralization capacity and the occurrence of a particular Variovorax phylotype (phylotype A)."
4725,"However, in another biopurification system setup, no such correlations were found."
4726,"Our data suggest that in the simulated environmental settings, the occurrence of libA can be linked to the linuron mineralization capacity and that libA is primarily hosted by Variovorax phylotype A strains."
4727,"However, the results also suggest that, apart from libA, other, as-yet-unknown isofunctional genes play an important role in linuron mineralization in the environment.Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been detected in bodies of water worldwide, yet their effects on the environment are not fully understood."
4728,"Recent toxicity studies suggest that mixtures of PPCPs at low concentrations may be detrimental to exposed organisms, highlighting the need to remove PPCPs from wastewater treatment plant effluent before it is discharged to the environment."
4729,"In this study, the utility of biofilm-based PPCP removal as a means to prevent environmental PPCP contamination was investigated."
4730,"The removal of 14 PPCPs, each at an initial concentration of 10 \xce\xbcg/L, was studied in laboratory sand columns inoculated with wastewater treatment plant effluent."
4731,"The examined PPCPs included biosol, biphenylol, p-chloro-m-cresol, p-chloro-m-xylenol, chlorophene, sodium diclofenac, gabapentin, gemfibrozil, 5-fluorouracil, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, triclosan, and valproic acid."
4732,"Ten of the PPCPs were removed by greater than 95% during column passage, while the four other compounds proved more recalcitrant."
4733,The effect of the concentration (either 50 or 1000 \xce\xbcg/L) of an easily degradable primary substrate (acetate) supplied along with the mixture of PPCPs was examined.
4734,"Most of the tested PPCPs were removed consistently by the biofilms regardless of the concentration of acetate, although the extent of removal for three compounds showed dependence on acetate concentration, and two behaved with no reproducible pattern over time."
4735,"Biofilm protein measurements indicated that the mixture of PPCPs supplied to columns suppressed biofilm growth, suggesting toxicity of the PPCPs to the biofilm communities."
4736,"This laboratory-scale experiment suggests that biofilm-based water treatment strategies, such as soil aquifer treatment and slow sand filtration, may be well-suited for the removal of many PPCPs from impacted water.A study with H(2)-based membrane biofilm reactors (MBfRs) was undertaken to examine the effectiveness of direct H(2) delivery in ex-situ reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes."
4737,Trichloroethene (TCE) could be reductively dechlorinated to ethene with up to 95% efficiency as long as the pH-increase effects of methanogens and homoacetogens were managed and dechlorinators were selected for during start-up by creating H(2) limitation.
4738,"Based on quantitative PCR, the dominant bacterial groups in the biofilm at the end of reactor operation were Dehalococcoides, Geobacter, and homoacetogens."
4739,Pyrosequencing confirmed the dominance of the dechlorinators and identified Acetobacterium as the key homoacetogen.
4740,"Homoacetogens outcompeted methanogens for bicarbonate, based on the effluent concentration of acetate, by suppressing methanogens during batch start-up."
4741,"This was corroborated by the methanogenesis functional gene mcrA, which was 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than the FTHFS functional gene for homoacetogens."
4742,Imaging of the MBfR fibers using scanning electron microscopy showed a distinct Dehalococcoides-like morphology in the fiber biofilm.
4743,"These results support that direct addition of H(2) can allow for efficient and complete reductive dechlorination, and they shed light into how H(2)-fed biofilms, when operated to manage methanogenic and homoacetogenic activity, can be used for ex-situ bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes.This study demonstrated the utility in correlating performance and community structure of a trichloroethene (TCE)-dechlorinating microbial consortium; specifically dechlorinators, fermenters, homoacetogens, and methanogens."
4744,Two complementary approaches were applied: predicting trends in the microbial community structure based on an electron balance analysis and experimentally assessing the community structure via pyrosequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR).
4745,"Fill-and-draw reactors inoculated with the DehaloR^2 consortium were operated at five TCE-pulsing rates between 14 and 168 \xc2\xb5mol/10-day-SRT, amended with TCE every 2 days to give peak concentrations between 0.047 and 0.56 mM (6-74 ppm) and supplied lactate and methanol as sources of e(-) donor and carbon."
4746,"The complementary approaches demonstrated the same trends: increasing abundance of Dehalococcoides and Geobacter and decreasing abundance of Firmicutes with increasing TCE pulsing rate, except for the highest pulsing rate."
4747,"Based on qPCR, the abundance of Geobacter and Dehalococcoides decreased for the highest TCE pulsing rate, and pyrosequencing showed this same trend for the latter."
4748,This deviation suggested decoupling of Dehalococcoides growth from dechlorination.
4749,"At pseudo steady-state, methanogenesis was minimal for all TCE pulsing rates."
4750,"Pyrosequencing and qPCR showed suppression of the homoacetogenic genera Acetobacterium at the two highest pulsing rates, and it was corroborated by a decreased production of acetate from lactate fermentation and increased propionate production."
4751,"Suppression of Acetobacterium, which can provide growth factors to Dehalococcoides, may have contributed to the decoupling for the highest TCE-pulsing rate.The bacterial isolate Paracoccus sp."
4752,"strain FLN-7 hydrolyzes amide pesticides such as diflubenzuron, propanil, chlorpropham, and dimethoate through amide bond cleavage."
4753,"A gene, ampA, encoding a novel arylamidase that catalyzes the amide bond cleavage in the amide pesticides was cloned from the strain."
4754,"ampA contains a 1,395-bp open reading frame that encodes a 465-amino-acid protein."
4755,AmpA was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and homogenously purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography.
4756,AmpA is a homodimer with an isoelectric point of 5.4.
4757,"AmpA displays maximum enzymatic activity at 40\xc2\xb0C and a pH of between 7.5 and 8.0, and it is very stable at pHs ranging from 5.5 to 10.0 and at temperatures up to 50\xc2\xb0C."
4758,"AmpA efficiently hydrolyzes a variety of secondary amine compounds such as propanil, 4-acetaminophenol, propham, chlorpropham, dimethoate, and omethoate."
4759,"The most suitable substrate is propanil, with K(m) and k(cat) values of 29.5 \xce\xbcM and 49.2 s(-1), respectively."
4760,The benzoylurea insecticides (diflubenzuron and hexaflumuron) are also hydrolyzed but at low efficiencies.
4761,No cofactor is needed for the hydrolysis activity.
4762,"AmpA shares low identities with reported arylamidases (less than 23%), forms a distinct lineage from closely related arylamidases in the phylogenetic tree, and has different biochemical characteristics and catalytic kinetics with related arylamidases."
4763,"The results in the present study suggest that AmpA is a good candidate for the study of the mechanism for amide pesticide hydrolysis, genetic engineering of amide herbicide-resistant crops, and bioremediation of amide pesticide-contaminated environments.This review focuses on 118 pharmaceuticals, belonging to seventeen different therapeutic classes, detected in raw urban wastewater and effluent from an activated sludge system, a usual treatment adopted for urban wastewaters worldwide prior to final discharge into surface water bodies."
4764,"Data pertaining to 244 conventional activated sludge systems and 20 membrane biological reactors are analysed and the observed ranges of variability of each selected compound in their influent and effluent reported, with particular reference to the substances detected most frequently and in higher concentrations."
4765,A snapshot of the ability of these systems to remove such compounds is provided by comparing their global removal efficiencies for each substance.
4766,"Where possible, the study then evaluates the average daily mass load of the majority of detected pharmaceuticals exiting the secondary treatment step."
4767,The final part of the review provides an assessment of the environmental risk posed by their presence in the secondary effluent by means of the risk quotient that is the ratio between the average pharmaceutical concentration measured in the secondary effluent and the predicted no-effect concentration.
4768,"Finally, mass load rankings of the compounds under review are compared with those based on their risk level."
4769,"This analysis shows that the highest amounts discharged through secondary effluent pertain to one antihypertensive, and several beta-blockers and analgesics/anti-inflammatories, while the highest risk is posed by antibiotics and several psychiatric drugs and analgesics/anti-inflammatories."
4770,"These results are reported with a view to aiding scientists and administrators in planning measures aiming to reduce the impact of treated urban wastewater discharge into surface water bodies.Mineralization potentials, rates, and kinetics of the three phenoxy acid (PA) herbicides, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), and 2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)propanoic acid (MCPP), were investigated and compared in 15 soils collected from five continents."
4771,"The mineralization patterns were fitted by zero/linear or exponential growth forms of the three-half-order models and by logarithmic (log), first-order, or zero-order kinetic models."
4772,"Prior and subsequent to the mineralization event, tfdA genes were quantified using real-time PCR to estimate the genetic potential for degrading PA in the soils."
4773,"In 25 of the 45 mineralization scenarios, \xe2\x88\xbc60% mineralization was observed within 118 days."
4774,Elevated concentrations of tfdA in the range 1 \xc3\x97 10(5) to 5 \xc3\x97 10(7) gene copies g(-1) of soil were observed in soils where mineralization could be described by using growth-linked kinetic models.
4775,"A clear trend was observed that the mineralization rates of the three PAs occurred in the order 2,4-D > MCPA > MCPP, and a correlation was observed between rapid mineralization and soils exposed to PA previously."
4776,"Finally, for 2,4-D mineralization, all seven mineralization patterns which were best fitted by the exponential model yielded a higher tfdA gene potential after mineralization had occurred than the three mineralization patterns best fitted by the Lin model.Despite the implication of anaerobic soil communities in important functions related to C and N biogeochemical cycles, their responses to pesticides are rarely assessed."
4777,"This study focused on the impact of alachlor, a chloroacetanilide herbicide, on two agricultural soils differing in their land use (fallow and corn-cultivated) in order to investigate the potential adaptation of anaerobic or facultative anaerobic soil microorganisms from fields with long history of herbicide use."
4778,The experiment was performed by developing slurries in anoxic conditions over 47 days.
4779,"Changes in the community structure assessed through terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rRNA genes clearly showed a shift in the bacterial community of the cultivated soil, whereas the modification of the microbial community of the fallow soil was delayed."
4780,"In addition, the analysis of alachlor degradation capacities of the two anaerobic communities indicated that 99 % of alachlor was removed in anoxic slurries of cultivated soil."
4781,Both these results suggested the preexistence of microorganisms in the cultivated soil able to respond promptly to the pesticide exposure.
4782,The composition of the anaerobic active community determined by 16S rRNA transcript analysis was mainly composed of strictly anaerobic Clostridia and the facultative anaerobe Bacilli classes.
4783,"Some genera, described for their role in herbicide biodegradation were active in alachlor-treated slurries, whereas others were no longer detected."
4784,"Finally, this study highlights, when triggered, the important diversity of the anaerobic community in soil.A brief review of the fate of micropollutants in membrane-based wastewater treatment due to sorption, stripping, biological degradation/transformation and membrane separation is discussed, to give an overview of these technologies due to the growing importance for water reuse purposes."
4785,Compared with conventional activated sludge treatment (CAS) micropollutant removal in membrane bioreactor (MBR) is slightly improved due to complete suspended solids removal and increased sludge age.
4786,"For discharge to sensitive receiving waters advanced treatment, such as post-ozonation or activated carbon adsorption, is recommended."
4787,In water reuse plants nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) efficiently reject micropollutants due to size exclusions as well as electrostatic and hydrophobic effects reaching potable quality.
4788,"To remove micropollutants fully, additionally post-ozone or the addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC) have to be applied, which in parallel also reduce NDMA precursors."
4789,The concentrate has to be treated if disposed to sensitive receiving waters due to its high micropollutant concentration and ecotoxicity potential.
4790,"The present review summarizes principles and capabilities for the most important membrane-based applications for wastewater treatment, i.e."
4791,porous membranes in MBRs (micro- or ultrafiltration) and dense membrane applications (NF and RO) for water reuse.A real-time quantitative PCR method was developed to detect and quantify phenlylurea hydrolase genes\' (puhA and puhB) sequences from environmental DNA samples to assess diuron-degrading genetic potential in some soil and sediment microbial communities.
4792,"In the soil communities, mineralization rates (determined with -labeled diuron) were linked to diuron-degrading genetic potentials estimated from puhB number copies, which increased following repeated diuron treatments."
4793,"In the sediment communities, mineralization potential did not depend solely on the quantity of puhB copies, underlining the need to assess gene expression."
4794,"In the sediment samples, both puhB copy numbers and mineralization capacities were highly conditioned by whether or not diuron-treated soil was added."
4795,This points to transfers of degradative potential from soils to sediments.
4796,No puhA gene was detected in soil and sediment DNA extracts.
4797,"Moreover, some sediments exhibited high diuron mineralization potential even though puhB genes were not detected, suggesting the existence of alternative diuron degradation pathways.Microbial associations with corals are common and are most likely symbiotic, although their diversity and relationships with environmental factors and host species remain unclear."
4798,"In this study, we adopted a 16S rRNA gene tag-pyrosequencing technique to investigate the bacterial communities associated with three stony Scleractinea and two soft Octocorallia corals from three locations in the Red Sea."
4799,"Our results revealed highly diverse bacterial communities in the Red Sea corals, with more than 600 ribotypes detected and up to 1,000 species estimated from a single coral species."
4800,"Altogether, 21 bacterial phyla were recovered from the corals, of which Gammaproteobacteria was the most dominant group, and Chloroflexi, Chlamydiae, and the candidate phylum WS3 were reported in corals for the first time."
4801,"The associated bacterial communities varied greatly with location, where environmental conditions differed significantly."
4802,"Corals from disturbed areas appeared to share more similar bacterial communities, but larger variations in community structures were observed between different coral species from pristine waters."
4803,"Ordination methods identified salinity and depth as the most influential parameters affecting the abundance of Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, Serratia, Stenotrophomonas, Pseudomonas, and Achromobacter in the corals."
4804,"On the other hand, bacteria such as Chloracidobacterium and Endozoicomonas were more sensitive to the coral species, suggesting that the host species type may be influential in the associated bacterial community, as well."
4805,The combined influences of the coral host and environmental factors on the associated microbial communities are discussed.
4806,This study represents the first comparative study using tag-pyrosequencing technology to investigate the bacterial communities in Red Sea corals.Relatively little is known regarding the spatial variability of microbial communities in aquifers where well fouling is an issue.
4807,"In this study 2 water wells were installed in an alluvial aquifer located adjacent to the North Saskatchewan River and an associated piezometer network developed to facilitate the study of microbial community structure, richness, and diversity."
4808,Carbon utilization data analysis revealed reduced microbial activity in waters collected close to the wells.
4809,"Functional PCR and quantitative PCR analysis indicated spatial variability in the potential for iron-, sulphate-, and nitrate-reducing activity at all locations in the aquifer."
4810,"Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of aquifer water samples using principal components analyses indicated that the microbial community composition was spatially variable, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis sequence analysis revealed that bacteria belonging to the genera  Acidovorax ,  Rhodobacter , and  Sulfuricurvum  were common throughout the aquifer."
4811,Shannon\'s richness (H\') and Pielou\'s evenness (J\') indices revealed a varied microbial diversity (H\' = 1.488-2.274) and an even distribution of microbial communities within the aquifer (J\' = 0.811-0.917).
4812,"Overall, these analyses revealed that the aquifer\'s microbial community varied spatially in terms of composition, richness, and metabolic activity."
4813,"Such information may facilitate the diagnosis, prevention, and management of fouling.The objective of this work was to identify relevant wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) parameters and underlying microbial processes that influence the biotransformation of a diverse set of micropollutants."
4814,"To do this, we determined biotransformation rate constants for ten organic micropollutants in batch reactors seeded with activated sludge from ten diverse WWTPs."
4815,The estimated biotransformation rate constants for each compound ranged between one and four orders of magnitude among the ten WWTPs.
4816,"The biotransformation rate constants were tested for statistical associations with various WWTP process parameters, amoA transcript abundance, and acetylene-inhibited monooxygenase activity."
4817,"We determined that (i) ammonia removal associates with oxidative micropollutant biotransformation reaction rates; (ii) archaeal but not bacterial amoA transcripts associate with both ammonia removal and oxidative micropollutant biotransformation reaction rates; and (iii) the activity of acetylene-inhibited monooxygenases (including ammonia monooxygenase) associates with ammonia removal and the biotransformation rate of isoproturon, but does not associate with all oxidative micropollutant biotransformations."
4818,"In combination, these results lead to the conclusion that ammonia removal and amoA transcript abundance can potentially be predictors of oxidative micropollutant biotransformation reactions, but that the biochemical mechanism is not necessarily linked to ammonia monooxygenase activity.Assessing in situ microbial abilities of soils to degrade pesticides is of great interest giving insight in soil filtering capability, which is a key ecosystem function limiting pollution of groundwater."
4819,Quantification of pesticide-degrading gene expression by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was tested as a suitable indicator to monitor pesticide biodegradation performances in soil.
4820,RNA extraction protocol was optimized to enhance the yield and quality of RNA recovered from soil samples to perform RT-qPCR assays.
4821,"As a model, the activity of atrazine-degrading communities was monitored using RT-qPCRs to estimate the level of expression of atzD in five agricultural soils showing different atrazine mineralization abilities."
4822,"Interestingly, the relative abundance of atzD mRNA copy numbers was positively correlated to the maximum rate and to the maximal amount of atrazine mineralized."
4823,"Our findings indicate that the quantification of pesticide-degrading gene expression may be suitable to assess biodegradation performance in soil and monitor natural attenuation of pesticide.Diffuse groundwater pollution from agricultural land use may impact the microbial groundwater community, which was investigated as Community-Level Physiological Profiles (CLPP) using EcoPlate\xe2\x84\xa2."
4824,Water was sampled from seven piezometers and a spring in a small agricultural catchment with diffuse herbicide and nitrate pollution.
4825,Based on the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson\'s diversity indices the diversity in the microbial communities was high.
4826,"The response from the EcoPlates\xe2\x84\xa2 showed which substrates support groundwater bacteria, and all 31 carbon sources were utilized by organisms from at least one water sample."
4827,"However, only nine carbon sources were utilized by all water samples: d-Mannitol, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, putrescine, d-galacturonic acid, itaconic acid, 4-hydroxy benzoic acid, tween 40, tween 80, and l-asparagine."
4828,"In all water samples the microorganisms preferred d-mannitol, d-galacturonic acid, tween 40, and 4-hydroxy benzoic acid as substrates, whereas none preferred 2-hydroxy benzoic acid, \xce\xb1-d-lactose, d,l-\xce\xb1-glycerol phosphate, \xce\xb1-ketobutyric acid, l-threonine and glycyl-l-glutamic acid."
4829,"Principal Component Analysis of the CLPP\'s clustered the most agriculturally affected groundwater samples, indicating that the agricultural land use affects the groundwater microbial communities."
4830,"Furthermore, the ability to mineralize atrazine and isoproturon, which have been used in the catchment, was also associated with this cluster.Molecular tools in microbial community analysis give access to information on catabolic potential and diversity of microbes."
4831,"Applied in bioremediation, they could provide a new dimension to improve pollution control."
4832,This concept has been demonstrated in the study using atrazine as model pollutant.
4833,"Bioremediation of the herbicide, atrazine, was analyzed in microcosm studies by bioaugmentation, biostimulation and natural attenuation."
4834,"Genes from the atrazine degrading pathway atzA/B/C/D/E/F, trzN, and trzD were monitored during the course of treatment and results demonstrated variation in atzC, trzD and trzN genes with time."
4835,Change in copy number of trzN gene under different treatment processes was demonstrated by real-time PCR.
4836,The amplified trzN gene was cloned and sequence data showed homology to genes reported in Arthrobacter and Nocardioides.
4837,"Results demonstrate that specific target genes can be monitored, quantified and correlated to degradation analysis which would help in predicting the outcome of any bioremediation strategy.This paper presents the characterization of the microbial community responsible for the in-situ bioremediation of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)."
4838,Microbial community structure and function was analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing methods for three sets of soil samples.
4839,"The three samples were collected from a HCH-dumpsite (450 mg HCH/g soil) and comprised of a HCH/soil ratio of 0.45, 0.0007, and 0.00003, respectively."
4840,"Certain bacterial; (Chromohalobacter, Marinimicrobium, Idiomarina, Salinosphaera, Halomonas, Sphingopyxis, Novosphingobium, Sphingomonas and Pseudomonas), archaeal; (Halobacterium, Haloarcula and Halorhabdus) and fungal (Fusarium) genera were found to be more abundant in the soil sample from the HCH-dumpsite."
4841,"Consistent with the phylogenetic shift, the dumpsite also exhibited a relatively higher abundance of genes coding for chemotaxis/motility, chloroaromatic and HCH degradation (lin genes)."
4842,Reassembly of a draft pangenome of Chromohalobacter salaxigenes sp.
4843,"(\xe2\x88\xbc8X coverage) and 3 plasmids (pISP3, pISP4 and pLB1; 13X coverage) containing lin genes/clusters also provides an evidence for the horizontal transfer of HCH catabolism genes.Methanogenic communities that degrade alkanes have been reported."
4844,"However, little is known about the key players involved in the process."
4845,"Methanogenic hexadecane-degrading consortia were enriched from an oilfield (Shengli, China)."
4846,The microbial dynamics during the transfer incubations were monitored using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting of 16S rRNA genes in combination with cloning and sequencing.
4847,The archaeal community shifted from a predominance of aceticlastic Methanosaeta during early cultivation to a substantial increase in hydrogenotrophic Methanoculleus in the highly enriched culture.
4848,Bacterial T-RFs 161 and 164\xc2\xa0bp were consistently detected during the incubation and became dominant in the highly enriched culture.
4849,"T-RF 161\xc2\xa0bp primarily represented uncultured Waste Water of Evry 1 bacterium, which was possibly associated with Candidatus Cloacamonas acidaminovorans (99.7% sequence similarity)."
4850,"T-RF 164\xc2\xa0bp could be assigned to both Thermotogaceae, with the closest relative being Candidatus Mesotoga sulfurreducens (similarity of 97%) and Syntrophaceae, with Smithella propionica as the closest relative (similarity of 96-97%)."
4851,These bacterial lineages were potentially capable of syntrophic interactions with methanogen partners during hexadecane degradation.
4852,"Partial assA genes (encoding the \xce\xb1-subunit of alkylsuccinate synthase) were also detected, implying that the mechanism of fumarate addition may function in the hexadecane activation.Since their first introduction in the mid 1950s, man-made s-triazine herbicides such as atrazine have extensively been used in agriculture to control broadleaf weed growth in different crops, and thus contributed to improving crop yield and quality."
4853,Atrazine is the most widely used s-triazine herbicide for the control of weeds in crops such as corn and sorghum.
4854,"Although atrazine was initially found to be slowly and partially biodegradable, predominantly by nonspecific P450 monoxygenases which do not sustain microbial growth, microorganisms gradually evolved as a result of repeated exposure, started using it as a growth substrate and eventually succeeded in mineralizing it."
4855,"Within three decades, an entirely new hydrolase-dependent pathway for atrazine mineralization emerged and rapidly spread worldwide among genetically different bacteria."
4856,"This review focuses on the enzymes involved in atrazine mineralization and their evolutionary histories, the genetic composition of microbial populations involved in atrazine degradation and the biotechnologies that have been developed, based on these systems, for the bioremediation of atrazine contamination in the environment.Two 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA)-degrading enrichment cultures selected from an aquifer on low (0.1 mg liter(-1)) or high (25 mg liter(-1)) MCPA concentrations were compared in terms of metabolic activity, community composition, population growth, and single cell physiology."
4857,Different community compositions and major shifts in community structure following exposure to different MCPA concentrations were observed using both 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting and pyrosequencing.
4858,The communities also differed in their MCPA-mineralizing activities.
4859,The enrichments selected on low concentrations mineralized MCPA with shorter lag phases than those selected on high concentrations.
4860,Flow cytometry measurements revealed that mineralization led to cell growth.
4861,The presence of low-nucleic acid-content bacteria (LNA bacteria) was correlated with mineralization activity in cultures selected on low herbicide concentrations.
4862,This suggests that LNA bacteria may play a role in degradation of low herbicide concentrations in aquifers impacted by agriculture.
4863,"This study shows that subpopulations of herbicide-degrading bacteria that are adapted to different pesticide concentrations can coexist in the same environment and that using a low herbicide concentration enables enrichment of apparently oligotrophic subpopulations.Microbial community composition and diversity at a diesel-contaminated railway site were investigated by pyrosequencing of bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene fragments to understand the interrelationships among microbial community composition, pollution level, and soil geochemical and physical properties."
4864,"To this end, 26 soil samples from four matrix types with various geochemical characteristics and contaminant concentrations were investigated."
4865,"The presence of diesel contamination significantly impacted microbial community composition and diversity, regardless of the soil matrix type."
4866,Clean samples showed higher diversity than contaminated samples (P < 0.001).
4867,"Bacterial phyla with high relative abundances in all samples included Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi."
4868,"High relative abundances of Archaea, specifically of the phylum Euryarchaeota, were observed in contaminated samples."
4869,"Redundancy analysis indicated that increased relative abundances of the phyla Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Euryarchaeota correlated with the presence of contamination."
4870,Shifts in the chemical composition of diesel constituents across the site and the abundance of specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs; defined using a 97% sequence identity threshold) in contaminated samples together suggest that natural attenuation of contamination has occurred.
4871,"OTUs with sequence similarity to strictly anaerobic Anaerolineae within the Chloroflexi, as well as to Methanosaeta of the phylum Euryarchaeota, were detected."
4872,"Anaerolineae and Methanosaeta are known to be associated with anaerobic degradation of oil-related compounds; therefore, their presence suggests that natural attenuation has occurred under anoxic conditions."
4873,This research underscores the usefulness of next-generation sequencing techniques both to understand the ecological impact of contamination and to identify potential molecular proxies for detection of natural attenuation.Rhodococcus  sp.
4874,strain B1 could degrade 100 mg/L butachlor within 5 days.
4875,"Butachlor was first hydrolyzed by strain B1 through N-dealkylation, which resulted in the production of butoxymethanol and 2-chloro-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)acetamide."
4876,"Butoxymethanol could be further degraded and utilized as the carbon source for the growth of strain B1, whereas 2-chloro-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)acetamide could not be degraded further."
4877,"The hydrolase designated ChlH, responsible for the N-dealkylation of the side chain of butachlor, was purified 185.1-fold to homogeneity with 16.1% recovery."
4878,"The optimal pH and temperature of ChlH were observed to be 7.0-7.5 and 30 \xc2\xb0C, respectively."
4879,"This enzyme was also able to catalyze the N-dealkylation of other chloroacetamide herbicides; the catalytic efficiency followed the order alachlor > acetochlor >butachlor > pretilachlor, which indicated that the alkyl chain length influenced the N-dealkylation of the chloroacetamide herbicides."
4880,"This is the first report on the biodegradation of chloroacetamide herbicides at the enzyme level.During the past 10 years, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae have become a substantial challenge to infection control."
4881,"It has been suggested by clinicians that the effectiveness of antibiotics is in such rapid decline that, depending on the pathogen concerned, their future utility can be measured in decades or even years."
4882,"Unless the rise in antibiotic resistance can be reversed, we can expect to see a substantial rise in incurable infection and fatality in both developed and developing regions."
4883,"Antibiotic resistance develops through complex interactions, with resistance arising by de-novo mutation under clinical antibiotic selection or frequently by acquisition of mobile genes that have evolved over time in bacteria in the environment."
4884,"The reservoir of resistance genes in the environment is due to a mix of naturally occurring resistance and those present in animal and human waste and the selective effects of pollutants, which can co-select for mobile genetic elements carrying multiple resistant genes."
4885,Less attention has been given to how anthropogenic activity might be causing evolution of antibiotic resistance in the environment.
4886,"Although the economics of the pharmaceutical industry continue to restrict investment in novel biomedical responses, action must be taken to avoid the conjunction of factors that promote evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance.To understand the role of abundance of tfdA gene classes belonging to \xce\xb2- and \xce\xb3-proteobacteria on phenoxy acid herbicide degradation, streambed sediments were sampled around three seepage meters (SMs) installed in a landfill-impacted groundwater-surface water interface."
4887,"Highest herbicide mass discharge to SM3, and lower herbicide mass discharges to SM1 and SM2 were determined due to groundwater discharge rates and herbicide concentrations."
4888,"SM1-sediment with the lowest abundance of tfdA gene classes had the slowest mineralization, whereas SM2- and SM3-sediments with more abundant tfdA genes had faster mineralization."
4889,"The observed difference in mineralization rates between discharge zones was simulated by a Monod-based kinetic model, which confirmed the role of abundance of tfdA gene classes."
4890,This study suggests presence of specific degraders adapted to slow growth rate and high yield strategy due to long-term herbicide exposure; and thus groundwater-surface water interface could act as a natural biological filter and protect stream water quality.Phenoxyacetic acids can be degraded by diverse soil microorganisms.
4891,"Nevertheless, we miss information about the succession of 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) degraders in micro-environments of soils as well as specific functions of different microbial groups during MCPA degradation."
4892,"We studied MCPA degradation at the soil-litter interface in a microcosm experiment and followed the succession of different degrader populations by quantifying the abundance of 16S rRNA genes as well as, the fungal ITS fragment and the functional genes tfdA (in total and divided into three classes) and cadA."
4893,"Adjacent to the litter layer, a dynamic depletion zone of MCPA indicated that the litter effect on MCPA degradation depends on substrate availability and the affected soil volume."
4894,The increase of the tfdA class III and cadA genes was linked to MCPA mineralisation.
4895,Total abundance of tfdA genes was dominated by class I MCPA degraders and did not reflect MCPA degradation potential of the soil.
4896,"Litter addition induced the development of pioneer and late-stage fungal communities, which were probably both involved in MCPA degradation."
4897,The results underline the importance of the ecological behaviour of different degrader populations for the understanding of herbicide degradation in soils.
4898,The worldwide fresh water scarcity is increasing the demand for non-conventional water resources.
4899,"Despite the technology being available for application of treated wastewater in irrigation, the use of effluent in agriculture is not being properly managed in the majority of cases."
4900,"Industrial countries, where financial resources are available but restricted, face difficulties in some cases related to the lack of a complete definition of irrigation water quality standards, as well as to the lack of monitoring components that determine if the effluent is suitable for such use."
4901,The present paper presents a critical review on urban reclamation technologies for irrigation.
4902,"The technologies are presented by the four most important parameters for irrigation water quality: salinity, pathogens, nutrients and heavy metals."
4903,"An overview is given of the current, on-going evaluation of different reclamation technologies for irrigation.To assess the involvement of the genus Variovorax and the linuron hydrolase gene libA in in situ linuron degradation in agricultural fields, changes in Variovorax community size and composition, in libA abundance and in linuron mineralization capacity were monitored in field soil plots either treated or not with a linuron-containing herbicide mixture."
4904,"Changes in Variovorax community composition, due to the proliferation of a hereto unknown Variovorax phylotype D, and increases in libA numbers occurred concomitant to increases in linuron mineralization capacity in the plot treated with the herbicide mixture."
4905,The observations suggest that Variovorax and libA proliferated as a response to linuron and hence their contribution to in situ linuron degradation.
4906,The involvement of Variovorax phylotype D and libA in linuron degradation in the examined soil was supported by laboratory soil microcosm experiments.
4907,Attempts to enrich in suspended cultures and isolate the organism corresponding to phylotype D from the soil were unsuccessful as the enrichment resulted in replacement of Variovorax phylotype D by other Variovorax phylotypes.
4908,"This illustrates that linuron-degrading strains isolated by liquid enrichment cultures are not always representatives of those responsive to linuron in the field, although the genus specificity of linuron degradation was retained.Micropollutants in groundwater are given significant attention by water companies and authorities due to an increasing awareness that they might be present even above the legal threshold values."
4909,"As part of our investigations of the possibility to remove the common groundwater pollutant 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) by introducing the efficient BAM degrader Aminobacter sp."
4910,"MSH1 into biologically active sand filters, we investigated if the strain adheres to filters containing various filter materials and if the initial adherence and subsequent degradation of BAM could be optimized."
4911,We found that most of the inoculated MSH1 cells adhered fast and that parameters like pH and ionic strength had only a minor influence on the adhesion despite huge influence on cell surface hydrophobicity.
4912,"At the given growth protocol, the MSH1 strain apparently developed a subpopulation that had lost its ability to adhere to the filter materials, which was supported by attempted reinoculation of non-adhered cells."
4913,"Analysis by quantitative PCR showed that most cells adhered in the top of the filters and that some of these were lost from the filters during initial operation, while insignificant losses occurred after 1 day of operation."
4914,The inoculated filters were found to degrade 2.7 \xce\xbcg/L BAM to below 0.1 \xce\xbcg/L at a 1.1-h residence time with insignificant formation of known degradation products.
4915,"In conclusion, most filter materials and water types should be feasible for inoculation with the MSH1 strain, while more research into degradation at low concentrations and temperatures is needed before this technology is ready for use at actual waterworks.Variovorax sp."
4916,"strain WDL1, which mineralizes the phenylurea herbicide linuron, expresses a novel linuron-hydrolyzing enzyme, HylA, that converts linuron to 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA)."
4917,"The enzyme is distinct from the linuron hydrolase LibA enzyme recently identified in other linuron-mineralizing Variovorax strains and from phenylurea-hydrolyzing enzymes (PuhA, PuhB) found in Gram-positive bacteria."
4918,"The dimeric enzyme belongs to a separate family of hydrolases and differs in Km, temperature optimum, and phenylurea herbicide substrate range."
4919,"Within the metal-dependent amidohydrolase superfamily, HylA and PuhA/PuhB belong to two distinct protein families, while LibA is a member of the unrelated amidase signature family."
4920,The hylA gene was identified in a draft genome sequence of strain WDL1.
4921,The involvement of hylA in linuron degradation by strain WDL1 is inferred from its absence in spontaneous WDL1 mutants defective in linuron hydrolysis and its presence in linuron-degrading Variovorax strains that lack libA.
4922,"In strain WDL1, the hylA gene is combined with catabolic gene modules encoding the downstream pathways for DCA degradation, which are very similar to those present in Variovorax sp."
4923,"SRS16, which contains libA."
4924,Our results show that the expansion of a DCA catabolic pathway toward linuron degradation in Variovorax can involve different but isofunctional linuron hydrolysis genes encoding proteins that belong to evolutionary unrelated hydrolase families.
4925,This may be explained by divergent evolution and the independent acquisition of the corresponding genetic modules.
4926,Groundwater is a vital component of rural and urban water supplies in New Zealand.
4927,"Although extensive monitoring of chemical and physical properties is conducted due to the high demand for this valuable resource, current information on its bacterial content is limited."
4928,"However, bacteria provide an immense contribution to drive the biogeochemical processes in the groundwater ecosystem as in any other ecosystem."
4929,"Therefore, a proper understanding of bacterial diversity is crucial to assess the effectiveness of groundwater management policies."
4930,"In this study, we investigated the bacterial community structure in NZ groundwater at a national scale using the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) molecular profiling tool and determined the relationships between bacterial diversity and groundwater chemistry, geological parameters and human impact."
4931,"Considerable bacterial diversity was present and the community structures were strongly related to groundwater chemistry, and in particular to redox potential and human impact, reflecting their potential influence on determination of bacterial diversity."
4932,"Further, the mean residence time of groundwater also showed relationships with bacterial community structure."
4933,These novel findings pertaining to community composition and its relationships with environmental parameters will provide a strong foundation for qualitative exploration of the bacterial diversity in NZ groundwater in relation to sustainable management of this valuable resource.
4934,The benefits of global pesticide use come at the cost of their widespread occurrence in the environment.
4935,"An array of abiotic and biotic transformations effectively removes pesticides from the environment, but may give rise to potentially hazardous transformation products."
4936,"Despite a large body of pesticide degradation data from regulatory testing and decades of pesticide research, it remains difficult to anticipate the extent and pathways of pesticide degradation under specific field conditions."
4937,"Here, we review the major scientific challenges in doing so and discuss emerging opportunities to identify pesticide degradation processes in the field."
4938,An important part of the evaluation of the effectiveness of persulfate in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) for treating organic contaminants is to identify and understand its potential impact on metal co-contaminants in the subsurface.
4939,Chromium is a redox-sensitive and toxic metal the release of which poses considerable risk to human health.
4940,The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of persulfate chemical oxidation on the release of chromium from three soils varying in physical-chemical properties.
4941,"Soils were treated with unactivated and activated persulfate  at two different concentrations (i.e., 41 mM and 2.1 mM persulfate) for 48 h and 6 months and were analyzed for release of chromium."
4942,Results show that release of chromium with persulfate chemical oxidation depends on the soil type and the activation method.
4943,Sandy soil with low oxidant demand released more chromium compared to soils with high oxidant demand.
4944,More chromium was released with alkaline pH activation.
4945,"Alkaline pH and high Eh conditions favor oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI), which is the main mechanism of release of chromium with persulfate chemical oxidation."
4946,Unactivated and Fe(II)-activated persulfate decreased pH and at low pH in absence of EDTA chromium release is not a concern.
4947,"These results indicate that chromium release can be anticipated based on the given site and treatment conditions, and ISCO system can be designed to minimize potential chromium release when treating soils and groundwater contaminated with both organic and metal contaminants."
4948,Pristine and energy-limited aquifers are considered to have a low resistance and resilience towards organic pollution.
4949,An experiment in an indoor aquifer system revealed an unexpected high intrinsic potential for the attenuation of a short-term toluene contamination.
4950,"A 30 h pulse of 486 mg of toluene, used as a model contaminant, and deuterated water (D2O) through an initially pristine, oxic, and organic carbon poor sandy aquifer revealed an immediate aerobic toluene degradation potential."
4951,"Based on contaminant and tracer break-through curves, as well as mass balance analyses and reactive transport modelling, a contaminant removal of 40 % over a transport distance of only 4.2 m in less than one week of travel time was obtained."
4952,"The mean first-order degradation rate constant was \xce\xbb = 0.178 day(-1), corresponding to a half-life time constant T1/2 of 3.87 days."
4953,Toluene-specific stable carbon isotope analysis independently proved that the contaminant mass removal can be attributed to microbial biodegradation.
4954,"Since average doubling times of indigenous bacterial communities were in the range of months to years, the aerobic biodegradation potential observed is assumed to be present and active in the pristine, energy-limited groundwater ecosystems at any time."
4955,Follow-up experiments and field studies will help to quantify the immediate natural attenuation potential of aquifers for selected priority contaminants and will try to identify the key-degraders within the autochthonous microbial communities.Two bacterial strains Sphingobium quisquiliarum DC-2 and Sphingobium baderi DE-13 were isolated from activated sludge.
4956,"Acetochlor was transformed by S. quisquiliarum DC-2 to a transitory intermediate 2-chloro-N-(2-methyl-6-ethylphenyl)acetamide (CMEPA), which was further transformed to 2-methyl-6-ethylaniline (MEA), and MEA could not be degraded by strain DC-2."
4957,"S. baderi DE-13, incapable of degrading acetochlor, showed capability of degrading MEA to an intermediate 2-methyl-6-ethylaminophenol (MEAOH)."
4958,"MEAOH was further transformed to 2-methyl-6-ethylbenzoquinoneimine (MEBQI), which was mineralized by strain DE-13."
4959,"A gene, cmeH, encoding an amidase that catalyzed the amide bond cleavage of CMEPA was cloned from strain DC-2."
4960,CmeH was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and homogenously purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity.
4961,"CmeH efficiently hydrolyzed CMEPA and other important herbicide, such as propanil, fenoxaprop-p-ethyl and clodinafop-propargyl.The environmental fate of phenylurea herbicides has received considerable attention in recent decades."
4962,"The microbial metabolism of N,N-dimethyl-substituted phenylurea herbicides can generally be initiated by mono-N-demethylation."
4963,"In this study, the molecular basis for this process was revealed."
4964,The pdmAB genes in Sphingobium sp.
4965,"strain YBL2 were shown to be responsible for the initial mono-N-demethylation of commonly used N,N-dimethyl-substituted phenylurea herbicides."
4966,PdmAB is the oxygenase component of a bacterial Rieske non-heme iron oxygenase (RO) system.
4967,"The genes pdmAB, encoding the \xce\xb1 subunit PdmA and the \xce\xb2 subunit PdmB, are organized in a transposable element flanked by two direct repeats of an insertion element resembling ISRh1."
4968,"Furthermore, this transposable element is highly conserved among phenylurea herbicide-degrading sphingomonads originating from different areas of the world."
4969,"However, there was no evidence of a gene for an electron carrier (a ferredoxin or a reductase) located in the immediate vicinity of pdmAB."
4970,"Without its cognate electron transport components, expression of PdmAB in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida, and other sphingomonads resulted in a functional enzyme."
4971,"Moreover, coexpression of a putative -type ferredoxin from Sphingomonas sp."
4972,strain RW1 greatly enhanced the catalytic activity of PdmAB in E. coli.
4973,These data suggested that PdmAB has a low specificity for electron transport components and that its optimal ferredoxin may be the  type.
4974,"PdmA exhibited low homology to the \xce\xb1 subunits of previously characterized ROs (less than 37% identity) and did not cluster with the RO group involved in O- or N-demethylation reactions, indicating that PdmAB is a distinct bacterial RO N-demethylase."
4975,The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of ammonia and nitrate nitrogen sources on simazine biodegradation by Arthrobacter sp.
4976,strain SD1 and the community structures of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) in non-agricultural soil.
4977,Soil microcosms with different treatments were constructed for herbicide biodegradation test.
4978,"The relative abundance of the strain SD1 and the structures of AOA and AOB communities were assessed using quantitative PCR (q-PCR) and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP), respectively."
4979,The co-existence of two inorganic nitrogen sources (ammonia and nitrate) had certain impact on simazine dissipation by the strain SD1.
4980,"Bioaugmentation could induce a shift in the community structures of both AOA and AOB, but AOA were more responsive."
4981,Nitrogen application had significant impacts on AOA and AOB communities in bioaugmented soils.
4982,"Moreover, in non-bioaugmented soil, the community structure of AOA, instead of AOB, could be quickly recovered after herbicide application."
4983,This study could add some new insights towards the impacts of nitrogen sources on s-triazine bioremediation and ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in soil ecosystem.
4984,"The abundance and diversity of biodegradation genes (BDGs) and potential degradation pathways of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), and atrazine (ATZ) in freshwater and marine sediments were investigated by metagenomic analysis using 6 datasets (16Gb in total)."
4985,"The datasets were derived using Illumina high-throughput sequencing and were based on BLAST against self-established databases of BDGs, DDT degradation genes (DDGs), HCH degradation genes (HDGs), and ATZ degradation genes (ADGs)."
4986,"The results showed that the abundance and diversity of BDGs, DDGs, HDGs, and ADGs varied with sample source and locations."
4987,"The lip and mnp genes, which encode for peroxidase, and the carA gene, which encodes for laccase, were detected as the dominant genes for degradation of organic pollutants."
4988,"The hdt, hdg, and atzB genes, which encode for hydratase, dehalogenase, and ethylaminohydrolase, were found to be the most abundant genes involved in DDT, HCH, and ATZ degradation, respectively."
4989,The identified 69 genera capable of degrading organic pollutants were mostly affiliated with Proteobacteria (49.3%) and Actinobacteria (21.7%).
4990,"Four genera, including Plesiocystis, Anaerolinea, Jannaschia, and Mycobacterium, were the major biodegradation populations in all sediments."
4991,"In this study, the nearly complete biodegradation pathways of DDT and ATZ were found, and the partial degradation pathway of HCH was detected in all sediments."
4992,The fundamentals of growth-linked biodegradation occurring at low substrate concentrations are poorly understood.
4993,Substrate utilization kinetics and microbial growth yields are two critically important process parameters that can be influenced by low substrate concentrations.
4994,Standard biodegradation tests aimed at measuring these parameters generally ignore the ubiquitous occurrence of assimilable organic carbon (AOC) in experimental systems which can be present at concentrations exceeding the concentration of the target substrate.
4995,"The occurrence of AOC effectively makes biodegradation assays conducted at low substrate concentrations mixed-substrate assays, which can have profound effects on observed substrate utilization kinetics and microbial growth yields."
4996,"In this work, we introduce a novel methodology for investigating biodegradation at low concentrations by restricting AOC in our experiments."
4997,We modified an existing method designed to measure trace concentrations of AOC in water samples and applied it to systems in which pure bacterial strains were growing on pesticide substrates between 0.01 and 50 mg liter(-1).
4998,We simultaneously measured substrate concentrations by means of high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (HPLC-UV) or mass spectrometry (MS) and cell densities by means of flow cytometry.
4999,Our data demonstrate that substrate utilization kinetic parameters estimated from high-concentration experiments can be used to predict substrate utilization at low concentrations under AOC-restricted conditions.
5000,"Further, restricting AOC in our experiments enabled accurate and direct measurement of microbial growth yields at environmentally relevant concentrations for the first time."
5001,These are critical measurements for evaluating the degradation potential of natural or engineered remediation systems.
5002,Our work provides novel insights into the kinetics of biodegradation processes and growth yields at low substrate concentrations.
5003,Micropollutants are emerging as a new challenge to the scientific community.
5004,"This review provides a summary of the recent occurrence of micropollutants in the aquatic environment including sewage, surface water, groundwater and drinking water."
5005,The discharge of treated effluent from WWTPs is a major pathway for the introduction of micropollutants to surface water.
5006,WWTPs act as primary barriers against the spread of micropollutants.
5007,"WWTP removal efficiency of the selected micropollutants in 14 countries/regions depicts compound-specific variation in removal, ranging from 12.5 to 100%."
5008,"Advanced treatment processes, such as activated carbon adsorption, advanced oxidation processes, nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and membrane bioreactors can achieve higher and more consistent micropollutant removal."
5009,"However, regardless of what technology is employed, the removal of micropollutants depends on physico-chemical properties of micropollutants and treatment conditions."
5010,The evaluation of micropollutant removal from municipal wastewater should cover a series of aspects from sources to end uses.
5011,"After the release of micropollutants, a better understanding and modeling of their fate in surface water is essential for effectively predicting their impacts on the receiving environment."
5012,Bacterial multispecies biofilms are catalysts for pollutant degradation in aqueous ecosystems.
5013,Their activity in systems where xenobiotics occur as micropollutants (\xce\xbcg L(-1) level) and natural dissolved organic matter provides carbon and energy instead remains uncharacterized.
5014,Biofilm formation of a bacterial consortium consisting of the linuron-degrading Variovorax sp.
5015,WDL1 and metabolite-degrading strains Comamonas sp.
5016,WDL7 and Hyphomicrobium sp.
5017,WDL6 at micropollutant linuron concentrations and the impact of auxiliary carbon sources on degradation and biofilm composition were investigated.
5018,"Biofilms formed at concentrations of 1000, 100, and 10 \xce\xbcg L(-1) linuron."
5019,"The highest biomass, organized in mixed-species mounds, was observed at 1000 \xce\xbcg L(-1) linuron, while at 100 and 10 \xce\xbcg L(-1) , thin layers of cells occurred."
5020,Linuron removal efficiencies decreased from c. 85% when fed with 100 and 1000 \xce\xbcg L(-1) linuron to 30% in case of 10 \xce\xbcg L(-1) linuron due to reduced specific activity.
5021,Biofilms grown on 10 \xce\xbcg L(-1) linuron were subsequently fed with easily and less degradable carbon sources in addition to 10 \xce\xbcg L(-1) linuron.
5022,"Although co-feeding with more degradable C-sources increased biofilm biomass, linuron removal remained 30%."
5023,"Calculations based on biofilm volume measurements pointed toward reduced specific activity, compensated by a higher biomass."
5024,Uncertainties about biofilm heterogeneity and cell volume can undo this explanation.Water recycling via aquifers has become a valuable tool to augment urban water supplies in many countries.
5025,This study reports the first use of passive samplers for monitoring of organic micropollutants in Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR).
5026,"Five different configurations of passive samplers were deployed in a stormwater treatment wetland, groundwater monitoring wells and a recovery tank to capture a range of polar and non-polar micropollutants present in the system."
5027,"The passive samplers were analysed for a suite of pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other chemicals."
5028,"As a result, 17 pesticides and pesticide degradation products, 5 PAHs and 8 other organic chemicals including flame retardants and fragrances were detected in urban stormwater recharging Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) and an Aquifer Storage Transfer and Recovery (ASTR) system."
5029,"Of the pesticides detected, diuron, metolachlor and chlorpyrifos were generally detected at the highest concentrations in one or more passive samplers, whereas chlorpyrifos, diuron, metolachlor, simazine, galaxolide and triallate were detected in multiple samplers."
5030,Fluorene was the PAH detected at the highest concentration and the flame retardant Tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate was the chemical detected in the greatest abundance at all sites.
5031,The passive samplers showed different efficiencies for capture of micropollutants with the Empore disc samplers giving the most reliable results.
5032,"The results indicate generally low levels of organic micropollutants in the stormwater, as the contaminants detected were present at very low ng/L levels, generally two to four orders of magnitude below the drinking water guidelines (NHMRC, 2011)."
5033,The efficiency of attenuation of these organic micropollutants during MAR was difficult to determine due to variations in the source water concentrations.
5034,"Comparisons were made between different samplers, to give a field-based calibration where existing lab-based calibrations were unavailable."
5035,Concerns about the potential for significant environmental impact from residues of human pharmaceuticals emerged at the beginning of the 21st century.
5036,"Since then there has been an exponential rise in the number of publications and conferences on this ""problem""."
5037,"However, this intense focus on human pharmaceuticals is misplaced."
5038,"Pharmaceuticals do not consist of a coherent group of substances with similar chemical, structural, biological or toxicological properties."
5039,"Pharmaceuticals are only identifiable from their use: in other words substances can be divided into two classes, those that are used as pharmaceuticals and those for which a possible pharmaceutical use has not yet been discovered."
5040,"For example, nitro-glycerine, Warfarin and dimethyl fumarate, initially sold respectively as an explosive, a rodenticide and a mould inhibitor have subsequently all been used as pharmaceuticals."
5041,"As analytical science advances, an increasing range of environmental contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, is being identified at sub \xce\xbcgL(-1) concentrations."
5042,"Although, human and environmental exposure to these contaminants will be low, all of them need to be subjected to risk assessment on a case by case basis."
5043,"Many of these substances, including human pharmaceuticals, may have little, if any, impact on human health or the environment, however for some substances there may be a significant risk and in these cases appropriate action should be taken."
5044,"However considering all human pharmaceuticals as a special case, isolated from the wider range of emerging contaminants, is scientifically unjustifiable and diverts resources away from the consideration of other substances that may be of considerably more significance."
5045,"Chlorophenols (CPs) and their derivatives are persistent environmental pollutants which are used in the manufacture of dyes, drugs, pesticides and other industrial products."
5046,"CPs, which include monochlorophenols, polychlorophenols, chloronitrophenols, chloroaminophenols and chloromethylphenols, are highly toxic to living beings due to their carcinogenic, mutagenic and cytotoxic properties."
5047,Several physico-chemical and biological methods have been used for removal of CPs from the environment.
5048,Bacterial degradation has been considered a cost-effective and eco-friendly method of removing CPs from the environment.
5049,Several bacteria that use CPs as their sole carbon and energy sources have been isolated and characterized.
5050,"Additionally, the metabolic pathways for degradation of CPs have been studied in bacteria and the genes and enzymes involved in the degradation of various CPs have been identified and characterized."
5051,This review describes the biochemical and genetic basis of the degradation of CPs and their derivatives.
5052,Trace amounts of pharmaceutical compounds have been detected in waters across the United States.
5053,"Many compounds are released as the result of human ingestion and subsequent excretion of over-the-counter and prescription medications, and illicit drugs."
5054,"This research utilized columns (30\xc3\x9730cm) of sand and undisturbed fine-grained sediments to simulate injection of wastewater containing pharmaceuticals and an illicit drug, such as would be found in a septic system, leaky sewer, or landfill."
5055,"The columns were placed in a temperature-controlled laboratory and each was injected with natural groundwater containing known concentrations of caffeine, methamphetamine, and acetaminophen."
5056,Natural attenuation of each chemical was observed in all columns.
5057,"The highest amount removed (approximately 90%) occurred in the undisturbed column injected with methamphetamine, compared with little reduction in the sand column."
5058,"When the suite of drugs was injected, loss of methamphetamine was less than when methamphetamine was injected alone."
5059,"The subsurface sediments exhibit the ability to remove a substantial amount of the injected pharmaceuticals and illicit drug; however, complete removal was not achieved."
5060,There was little attenuation of injected pharmaceuticals in the sand column which demonstrates a concern for water quality in the environment if pharmaceuticals were to contaminate a sandy aquifer.
5061,Understanding the transport of pharmaceuticals in the subsurface environment is an important component of protecting drinking water supplies from contamination.
5062,"To collect a complete dataset regarding the occurrence of organic substances in groundwater, this study presents the examination of 66 organic contaminants in the groundwater of overseas departments, including pesticides, pharmaceutical compounds, hormones and some industrial substances."
5063,The selective and sensitive analytical methods are described.
5064,These techniques begin with solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-ToF-MS).
5065,"The paper summarises the analytical results from 40 sampling points collected during two campaigns in Guadeloupe, Martinique, Reunion, Mayotte and Guiana, representing 80 samples."
5066,"Of the 66 target substances, 36 were determined at least once."
5067,"Among the most frequently detected are bisphenol A (frequency, 96%; max., 7,400 ng/L), caffeine (frequency, 91%; max., 1,240 ng/L), pentachlorophenol (frequency, 55%; max., 418 ng/L), and carbamazepine (frequency, 56%; max., 22 ng/L)."
5068,"The results do not put in evidence that the origin of the sample or climatic characteristics of these regions influence the dilution and release of micropollutants.In the present study, a newly developed metagenomic analysis approach was applied to investigate the abundance and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in aquaculture farm sediments, activated sludge, biofilm, anaerobic digestion sludge, and river water."
5069,BLASTX analysis against the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database was conducted for the metagenomic sequence data of each sample and then the ARG-like sequences were sorted based on structured sub-database using customized scripts.
5070,"The results showed that freshwater fishpond sediment had the highest abundance (196\xc2\xa0ppm), and anaerobic digestion sludge possessed the highest diversity (133 subtypes) of ARGs among the samples in this study."
5071,"Significantly, rifampin resistance genes were universal in all the diverse samples and consistently accounted for 26.9~38.6\xc2\xa0% of the total annotated ARG sequences."
5072,"Furthermore, a significant linear correlation (R (2)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890.924) was found between diversities (number of subtypes) of ARGs and diversities of plasmids in diverse samples."
5073,This work provided a wide spectrum scan of ARGs and MGEs in different environments and revealed the prevalence of rifampin resistance genes and the strong correlation between ARG diversity and plasmid diversity for the first time.
5074,"This study was performed to reveal the microbial community characteristics in simulated managed aquifer recharge (MAR), a natural water treatment system, under different concentrations and compositions of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) and further link these to the biotransformation of emerging trace organic chemicals (TOrCs)."
5075,Two pairs of soil-column setups were established in the laboratory receiving synthetic feed solutions composed of different peptone/humic acid ratios and concentrations.
5076,Higher BDOC concentration resulted in lower microbial community diversity and higher relative abundance of Betaproteobacteria.
5077,"Decreasing the peptone/humic acid ratio resulted in higher diversity of the community and higher relative abundances of Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, and Actinobacteria."
5078,The metabolic capabilities of microbiome involved in xenobiotics biodegradation were significantly promoted under lower BDOC concentration and higher humic acid content.
5079,Cytochrome P450 genes were also more abundant under these primary substrate conditions.
5080,Lower peptone/humic acid ratios also promoted the attenuation of most TOrCs.
5081,"These results suggest that the primary substrate characterized by a more refractory character could increase the relative abundances of Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, and Actinobacteria, as well as associated cytochrome P450 genes, all of which should play important roles in the biotransformation of TOrCs in this natural treatment system."
5082,Atrazine is transformed to N-isopropylammelide through hydroxyatrazine as an intermediate as indicated by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy in culture filtrates of Frankia alni ACN14a and Frankia sp.
5083,EuI1c.
5084,"Both Frankia strains have the ability to degrade atrazine via dechlorination and dealkylation and, subsequently, may be using it as a nitrogen and carbon source as detected here by increasing their growth patterns."
5085,"Bioinformatic analysis of the Frankia genomes revealed that a potential gene cluster involved in atrazine decomposition contains three genes, namely, trzN (FRAAL1474 and FraEuI1c_5874), atzB (FRAAL1473 and FraEuI1c_5875), and atzR (FRAAL1471)."
5086,The relative messenger RNA gene expression of the former genes was examined by qRT-PCR.
5087,"The LysR-type transcriptional regulator atzR (FRAAL1471), which is expected to control the cluster expression, showed a 13-fold increase in the expression level under atrazine stress."
5088,"Moreover, the putative adenosine aminohydrolase 3 atzB (FRAAL1473), which is expected to dealkylate the N-ethyl group of atrazine, showed also an increased expression by factor 16 with increased exposure."
5089,"Eventually, the trzN (FRAAL1474) gene, which is predicted to encode a putative amidohydrolase catalyzing atrazine dechlorination, exhibited 31-fold increased expression."
5090,"To our best knowledge, this is the first report about adenosine aminohydrolase 3 function in the dealkylation of the N-ethyl group from atrazine."
5091,Accumulation of pesticides in the environment causes serious issues of contamination and toxicity.
5092,"Bioremediation is an ecologically sound method to manage soil pollution, but the bottleneck here, is the successful scale-up of lab-scale experiments to field applications."
5093,This study demonstrates pilot-scale bioremediation in tropical soil using atrazine as model pollutant.
5094,"Mimicking field conditions, three different bioremediation strategies for atrazine degradation were explored."
5095,"100\xc2\xa0kg soil mesocosms were set-up, with or without atrazine application history."
5096,"Natural attenuation and enhanced bioremediation were tested, where augmentation with an atrazine degrading consortium demonstrated best pollutant removal."
5097,"90% atrazine degradation was observed in six days in soil previously exposed to atrazine, while soil without history of atrazine use, needed 15 days to remove the same amount of amended atrazine."
5098,The bacterial consortium comprised of 3 novel bacterial strains with different genetic atrazine degrading potential.
5099,"The progress of bioremediation was monitored by measuring the levels of atrazine and its intermediate, cyanuric acid."
5100,"Genes from the atrazine degradation pathway, namely, atzA, atzB, atzD, trzN and trzD were quantified in all mesocosms for 60 days."
5101,The highest abundance of all target genes was observed on the 6th day of treatment.
5102,trzD was observed in the bioaugmented mesocosms only.
5103,The bacterial community profile in all mesocosms was monitored by LH-PCR over a period of two months.
5104,"Results indicate that the communities changed rapidly after inoculation, but there was no drastic change in microbial community profile after 1 month."
5105,Results indicated that efficient bioremediation of atrazine using a microbial consortium could be successfully up-scaled to pilot scale.
5106,"Diclofenac (DCF) is a common anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical that is often detected in waste wasters, effluents and surface waters."
5107,"Recently, DCF was included in the watch list of substances in EU that requires its environmental monitoring in the member states."
5108,DCF is also known to harmfully affect several environmental species already at concentrations of \xe2\x89\xa4 1 \xce\xbcg/l.
5109,This review focuses on the occurrence and fate of DCF in conventional wastewater treatment processes.
5110,Research done in this area was gathered and analyzed in order to find out the possibilities to enhance DCF elimination during biological wastewater treatment.
5111,"More precisely, human metabolism, concentrations in wastewater influents and effluents, elimination rates in the treatment train, roles of sorption and biotransformation mechanisms during the treatment as well as formation of transformation products are reported."
5112,"Additionally, the effect of process configuration, i.e."
5113,"conventional activated sludge (CAS), biological nutrient removal (BNR), membrane bioreactor (MBR) and attached-growth bioreactor, and process parameters, i.e."
5114,solids retention time (SRT) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) are presented.
5115,"Generally, DCF is poorly biodegradable which often translates into low elimination rates during biological wastewater treatment."
5116,Only a minor portion is sorbed to sludge.
5117,MBR and attached-growth bioreactors may result in higher elimination of DCF over CAS or BNR.
5118,Long SRTs (>150 d) favor the DCF elimination due to sludge adaptation.
5119,Longer HRTs (>2-3d) could significantly increase the elimination of DCF during biological wastewater treatment.
5120,"Bioaugmentation could be used to enhance DCF elimination, however, this requires more research on microbial communities that are able to degrade DCF."
5121,"Also, further research is needed to gain more information about the deconjugation processes and biotic and abiotic transformation and the nature of transformation products.The number of new chemicals produced is increasing daily by the thousands, and it is inevitable that many of these chemicals will reach the environment."
5122,Current research provides an understanding of how the evolution of promiscuous enzymes and the recruitment of enzymes available from the metagenome allows for the assembly of these pathways.
5123,"Nevertheless, physicochemical constraints including bioavailability, bioaccessibility, and the structural variations of similar chemicals limit the evolution of biodegradation pathways."
5124,"Similarly, physiological constraints related to kinetics and substrate utilization at low concentrations likewise limit chemical-enzyme interactions and consequently evolution."
5125,"Considering these new data, the biodegradation decalogue still proves valid while at the same time the underlying mechanisms are better understood."
5126,Municipal wastewaters contain a multitude of organic trace pollutants.
5127,"Often, their biodegradability by activated sludge microorganisms is decisive for their elimination during wastewater treatment."
5128,"Since the amounts of micropollutants seem too low to serve as growth substrate, cometabolism is supposed to be the dominating biodegradation process."
5129,"Nevertheless, as many biodegradation studies were performed without the intention to discriminate between metabolic and cometabolic processes, the specific contribution of the latter to substance transformations is often not clarified."
5130,This minireview summarizes current knowledge about the cometabolic degradation of organic trace pollutants by activated sludge and sludge-inherent microorganisms.
5131,"Due to their relevance for communal wastewater contamination, the focus is laid on pharmaceuticals, personal care products, antibiotics, estrogens, and nonylphenols."
5132,"Wherever possible, reference is made to the molecular process level, i.e., cometabolic pathways, involved enzymes, and formed transformation products."
5133,Particular cometabolic capabilities of different activated sludge consortia and various microbial species are highlighted.
5134,Process conditions favoring cometabolic activities are emphasized.
5135,"Finally, knowledge gaps are identified, and research perspectives are outlined.Twenty-two 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)-degrading bacterial isolates were collected from agricultural soils at three sites in China."
5136,"Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA genes indicated that the isolates were phylogenetically grouped into four categories: Ochrobactrum anthropi, in the Alpha- class of the phylum Proteobacteria (3 out of 22 isolates), Cupriavidus sp., of the Betaproteobacteria (3 out of 22), Pseudomonas sp."
5137,"and Stenotrophomonas sp., which are Gammaproteobacteria (7 out of 22), and Bacillus sp., of the phylum Firmicutes (9 out of 22)."
5138,"Primers were designed to amplify the conserved domain of tfdA, which is known to be involved in the degradation of 2,4-D."
5139,"Results showed that the tfdA genes of all 22 strains were most similar to that of Cupriavidus necator JMP134, which belongs to the 2,4-D/\xce\xb1-ketoglutarate dioxygenase TfdA protein family, indicating that the JMP134-type tfdA gene is likely to be almost universal among the 2,4-D-degrading bacteria isolated from China."
5140,"Degradation abilities of these 22 strains were investigated in assays using 2,4-D as the sole source of carbon and energy."
5141,"Thirteen strains degraded >60 % of the available 2,4-D (500 mg l(-1)) over a 1-week incubation period, while a further nine Bacillus sp."
5142,"strains degraded 50-81 % of the available 2,4-D. None of these nine strains degraded other selected herbicides, such as mecoprop, 2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, quizalofop, and fluroxypyr."
5143,"This is the first report of 2,4-D-degradation by Bacilli.Micropollutants (MPs) as individual compounds or in complex mixtures are relevant for water quality and may trigger unwanted ecological effects."
5144,MPs originate from different point and diffuse sources and enter water bodies via different flow paths.
5145,"Effluents from conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), in which various MPs are not or not completely removed, is one major source."
5146,"To improve the water quality and avoid potential negative ecological effects by micropollutants, various measures to reduce the discharge should be taken."
5147,"In this feature we discuss one of these measures; the benefits of upgrading WWTPs toward reduced MP loads and toxicities from wastewater effluents, using the recently decided Swiss strategy as an example."
5148,"Based on (i) full-scale case studies using ozonation or powder activated carbon treatment, showing substantial reduction of MP discharges and concomitant reduced toxicities, (ii) social and political acceptance, (iii) technical feasibility and sufficient cost-effectiveness, the Swiss authorities recently decided to implement additional wastewater treatment steps as mitigation strategy to improve water quality."
5149,"Since MPs are of growing global concern, the concepts and considerations behind the Swiss strategy are explained in this feature, which could be of use for other countries as well."
5150,"It should be realized that upgrading WWTPs is not the only solution to reduce the discharge of MPs entering the environment, but is part of a broader, multipronged mitigation strategy."
5151,"Sphingomonads DC-6 and DC-2 degrade the chloroacetanilide herbicides alachlor, acetochlor, and butachlor via N-dealkylation."
5152,"In this study, we report a three-component Rieske non-heme iron oxygenase (RHO) system catalyzing the N-dealkylation of these herbicides."
5153,The oxygenase component gene cndA is located in a transposable element that is highly conserved in the two strains.
5154,CndA shares 24 to 42% amino acid sequence identities with the oxygenase components of some RHOs that catalyze N- or O-demethylation.
5155,Two putative  ferredoxin genes and one glutathione reductase (GR)-type reductase gene were retrieved from the genome of each strain.
5156,These genes were not located in the immediate vicinity of cndA.
5157,"The four ferredoxins share 64 to 72% amino acid sequence identities to the ferredoxin component of dicamba O-demethylase (DMO), and the two reductases share 62 to 65% amino acid sequence identities to the reductase component of DMO."
5158,"cndA, the four ferredoxin genes, and the two reductases genes were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant proteins were purified using Ni-affinity chromatography."
5159,"The individual components or the components in pairs displayed no activity; the enzyme mixture showed N-dealkylase activities toward alachlor, acetochlor, and butachlor only when CndA-His6 was combined with one of the four ferredoxins and one of the two reductases, suggesting that the enzyme consists of three components, a homo-oligomer oxygenase, a  ferredoxin, and a GR-type reductase, and CndA has a low specificity for the electron transport component (ETC)."
5160,"The N-dealkylase utilizes NADH, but not NADPH, as the electron donor."
5161,Groundwater constitutes the main source of public drinking water supply in many regions.
5162,"Thus, the contamination of groundwater resources by organic chemicals is a matter of growing concern because of its potential effects on public health."
5163,"The present manuscript compiles the most recent works related to the study of synthetic organic compounds (SOCs) in groundwater, with special focus on the occurrence of contaminants not or barely covered by previously published reviews, e.g., pesticide and pharmaceutical transformation products, lifestyle products, and industrial chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors, brominated and organophosphate flame retardants, plasticizers, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)."
5164,"Moreover, the main challenges in managed aquifer recharge, i.e., reclaimed water injection and infiltration, and riverbank filtration, regarding natural attenuation of organic micropollutants are discussed, and insights into the future chemical quality of groundwater are provided."
5165,"The use of chemicals is continuously growing both in total amount as well as in a number of different substances, among which organic chemicals play a major role."
5166,"Owing to the growing public awareness on the need of protecting both ecosystems and human health from the risks related to chemical pollution, an increasing attention has been drowned to risk assessment and prioritization of organic pollutants."
5167,"In this context, the aims of this study were (a) to perform an environmental risk assessment for 200 organic micropollutants including both regulated and emerging contaminants (pesticides, alkylphenols, pharmaceuticals, hormones, personal care products, perflourinated compounds and various industrial organic chemicals) monitored in four rivers located in the Mediterranean side of the Iberian Peninsula, namely, the Ebro, Llobregat, J\xc3\xbacar and Guadalquivir rivers; and (b) to prioritize them for each of the four river basins studied, taking into account their observed concentration levels together with their ecotoxicological potential."
5168,"For this purpose, a prioritization approach has been developed and a resulting ranking index (RI) associated with each compound."
5169,"Ranking index is based on the measured concentrations of the chemical in each river and its ecotoxicological potential (EC50 values for algae, Daphnia sp."
5170,and fish).
5171,"Ten compounds were identified as most important for the studied rivers: pesticides chlorpyriphos, chlorfenvinphos, diazinon, dichlofenthion, prochloraz, ethion carbofuran and diuron and the industrial organic chemicals nonylphenol and octylphenol that result from the biodegration of polyethoxylated alkyphenol surfactants."
5172,"Also, further research into chronic toxicity of emerging contaminants is advocated."
5173,"This study aimed at monitoring the dynamics of phylogenetic and catabolic genes of a dechlorinating enrichment culture before, during, and after complete dechlorination of chlorinated compounds."
5174,"More specifically, the effect of 40 \xce\xbcM trichloroethene (TCE) and 5.6 mM lactate on the gene abundance and activity of an enrichment culture was investigated for 40 days."
5175,"Although tceA and vcrA gene copy numbers were relatively stable in DNA extracts over time, tceA and vcrA mRNA abundances were upregulated from undetectable levels to 2.96 \xc3\x97 and 6.33 \xc3\x97 10\xe2\x81\xb4 transcripts/mL, respectively, only after exposure to TCE and lactate."
5176,"While tceA gene transcripts decreased over time with TCE dechlorination, the vcrA gene was expressed steadily even when the concentration of vinyl chloride was at undetectable levels."
5177,"In addition, ratios between catabolic and phylogenetic genes indicated that tceA and vcrA gene carrying organisms dechlorinated TCE and its produced daughter products, while vcrA gene was mainly responsible for the dechlorination of the lower VC concentrations in a later stage of degradation.On-farm biopurification systems (BPSs) treat pesticide-containing wastewater at farms by biodegradation and sorption processes."
5178,"The inclusion of pesticide-primed material carrying a pesticide-degrading microbial community is beneficial for improving biodegradation, but no data exist for treating wastewater containing multiple pesticides, as often occurs on farms."
5179,"In a microcosm set-up, an examination was carried out to determine whether multiple pesticide degradation activities could be simultaneously established in the matrix of a BPS by the simultaneous inclusion of different, appropriate pesticide-primed materials."
5180,"The microcosms were fed with a mixture of pesticides including the fungicide metalaxyl and the herbicides bentazon, isoproturon, linuron and metamitron, and pesticide-degrading activities were monitored over time.The degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) was investigated under fermentative-methanogenic conditions for up to 60 days in the presence of anaerobic biomass from a full-scale UASB reactor."
5181,The low methane yields in the PCBs-spiked batch reactors suggested that the biomass had an inhibitory effect on the methanogenic community.
5182,Reactors containing PCBs and co-substrates (ethanol/sodium formate) exhibited substantial PCB reductions from 0.7 to 0.2 mg mL(-1).
5183,"For the Bacteria domain, the PCBs-spiked reactors were grouped with the PCB-free reactors with a similarity of 55 %, which suggested the selection of a specific population in the presence of PCBs."
5184,"Three genera of bacteria were found exclusively in the PCB-spiked reactors and were identified using pyrosequencing analysis, Sedimentibacter, Tissierela and Fusibacter."
5185,"Interestingly, the Sedimentibacter, which was previously correlated with the reductive dechlorination of PCBs, had the highest relative abundance in the RCS-PCB (7.4 %) and RCS-PCB-PF (12.4 %) reactors."
5186,"Thus, the anaerobic sludge from the UASB reactor contains bacteria from the Firmicutes phylum that are capable of degrading PCBs.Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to identify sources of emerging organic contaminants in the Zumbro River watershed in Southeastern Minnesota."
5187,"Two main principal components (PCs) were identified, which together explained more than 50% of the variance in the data."
5188,"Principal Component 1 (PC1) was attributed to urban wastewater-derived sources, including municipal wastewater and residential septic tank effluents, while Principal Component 2 (PC2) was attributed to agricultural sources."
5189,"The variances of the concentrations of cotinine, DEET and the prescription drugs carbamazepine, erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole were best explained by PC1, while the variances of the concentrations of the agricultural pesticides atrazine, metolachlor and acetochlor were best explained by PC2."
5190,"Mixed use compounds carbaryl, iprodione and daidzein did not specifically group with either PC1 or PC2."
5191,"Furthermore, despite the fact that caffeine and acetaminophen have been historically associated with human use, they could not be attributed to a single dominant land use category (e.g., urban/residential or agricultural)."
5192,"Contributions from septic systems did not clarify the source for these two compounds, suggesting that additional sources, such as runoff from biosolid-amended soils, may exist."
5193,"Based on these results, PCA may be a useful way to broadly categorize the sources of new and previously uncharacterized emerging contaminants or may help to clarify transport pathways in a given area."
5194,Acetaminophen and caffeine were not ideal markers for urban/residential contamination sources in the study area and may need to be reconsidered as such in other areas as well.
5195,"Groundwaters may act as sinks or sources of organic and inorganic solutes, depending on the relative magnitude of biochemical mobilizing processes and groundwater-surface water exchanges."
5196,The objective of this study was to link the lithological and hydrogeological gradients to the aquatic microbial community structure in the transition from aquifer recharge (volcanic formations) to discharge areas (alluvial deposits).
5197,"A field-scale analysis was performed along a water table aquifer in which volcanic products decreased in thickness and areal extension, while alluvial deposits became increasingly important."
5198,We measured the main groundwater physical parameters and the concentrations of major and trace elements.
5199,"In addition, the microbial community structure was assessed by estimating the occurrence of total coliforms and Escherichia coli, the prokaryotic abundance, the cytometric and phylogenetic community composition."
5200,The overall biogeochemical asset differed along the aquifer flow path.
5201,"The concentration of total and live prokaryotic cells significantly increased in alluvial waters, together with the percentages of Beta- and Delta-Proteobacteria."
5202,The microbial propagation over a theoretical groundwater travel time allowed for the identification of microbial groups shifting significantly in the transition between the two different hydrogeochemical facies.
5203,"The microbial community structure was intimately associated with geochemical changes, thus it should be further considered in view of a better understanding of groundwater ecology and sustainable management strategies."
5204,The microbial monitoring of drinking water production systems is essential to assure water quality and minimize possible risks.
5205,"However, the comparative impact of microbes from the surrounding aquifer and of those established within drinking water wells on water parameters remains poorly understood."
5206,High pressure jetting is a routine method to impede well clogging by fine sediments and also biofilms.
5207,"In the present study, bacterial communities were investigated in a drinking water production system before, during, and after hydraulic purging."
5208,"Variations were observed in bacterial communities between different wells of the same production system before maintenance, despite them having practically identical water chemistries."
5209,"This may have reflected the distinct usage practices of the different wells, and also local aquifer heterogeneity."
5210,"Hydraulic jetting of one well preferentially purged a subset of the dominating taxa, including lineages related to Diaphorobacter, Nitrospira, Sphingobium, Ralstonia, Alkanindiges, Janthinobacterium, and Pseudomonas spp, suggesting their tendency for growth in well-associated biofilms."
5211,Lineages of potential drinking water concern (i.e.
5212,"Legionellaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Acinetobacter spp.)"
5213,reacted distinctly to hydraulic jetting.
5214,Bacterial diversity was markedly reduced in drinking water 2 weeks after the cleaning procedure.
5215,"The results of the present study provide a better understanding of drinking water wells as a microbial habitat, as well as their role in the microbiology of drinking water systems.Pollutants such as pesticides and their degradation products occur ubiquitously in natural aquatic environments at trace concentrations (\xce\xbcg L(-1) and lower)."
5216,Microbial biodegradation processes have long been known to contribute to the attenuation of pesticides in contaminated environments.
5217,"However, challenges remain in developing engineered remediation strategies for pesticide-contaminated environments because the fundamental processes that regulate growth-linked biodegradation of pesticides in natural environments remain poorly understood."
5218,"In this research, we developed a model framework to describe growth-linked biodegradation of pesticides at trace concentrations."
5219,We used experimental data reported in the literature or novel simulations to explore three fundamental kinetic processes in isolation.
5220,We then combine these kinetic processes into a unified model framework.
5221,The three kinetic processes described were: the growth-linked biodegradation of micropollutant at environmentally relevant concentrations; the effect of coincidental assimilable organic carbon substrates; and the effect of coincidental microbes that compete for assimilable organic carbon substrates.
5222,We used Monod kinetic models to describe substrate utilization and microbial growth rates for specific pesticide and degrader pairs.
5223,"We then extended the model to include terms for utilization of assimilable organic carbon substrates by the specific degrader and coincidental microbes, growth on assimilable organic carbon substrates by the specific degrader and coincidental microbes, and endogenous metabolism."
5224,The proposed model framework enables interpretation and description of a range of experimental observations on micropollutant biodegradation.
5225,The model provides a useful tool to identify environmental conditions with respect to the occurrence of assimilable organic carbon and coincidental microbes that may result in enhanced or reduced micropollutant biodegradation.
5226,"In light of the increasing interest in development of sustainable potable reuse systems, additional research is needed to elucidate the risks of producing drinking water from new raw water sources."
5227,"This article investigates the presence and potential health risks of organic micropollutants in greywater, a potential new source for potable water production introduced in this work."
5228,An extensive literature survey reveals that almost 280 organic micropollutants have been detected in greywater.
5229,A three-tiered approach is applied for the preliminary health risk assessment of these chemicals.
5230,"Benchmark values are derived from established drinking water standards for compounds grouped in Tier 1, from literature toxicological data for compounds in Tier 2, and from a Threshold of Toxicological Concern approach for compounds in Tier 3."
5231,A risk quotient is estimated by comparing the maximum concentration levels reported in greywater to the benchmark values.
5232,"The results show that for the majority of compounds, risk quotient values were below 0.2, which suggests they would not pose appreciable concern to human health over a lifetime exposure to potable water."
5233,Fourteen compounds were identified with risk quotients above 0.2 which may warrant further investigation if greywater is used as a source for potable reuse.
5234,The present findings are helpful in prioritizing upcoming greywater quality monitoring and defining the goals of multiple barriers treatment in future water reclamation plants for potable water production.
5235,Methane-oxidizing cultures from five different inocula were enriched to be used for co-metabolic degradation of micropollutants.
5236,"In a first screening, 18 different compounds were tested for degradation with the cultures as well as with four pure methane-oxidizing bacterial (MOB) strains."
5237,"The tested compounds included pharmaceuticals, chemical additives, pesticides, and their degradation products."
5238,"All enriched cultures were successful in the degradation of at least four different pollutants, but the compounds degraded most often were sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and benzotriazole (BTZ)."
5239,"Addition of acetylene, a specific methane monooxygenase (MMO) inhibitor, revealed that SMX and BTZ were mainly degraded co-metabolically by the present MOB."
5240,"The pure MOB cultures exhibited less degradation potential, while SMX and BTZ were also degraded by three of the four tested pure strains."
5241,"For MOB, copper (Cu(2+)) concentration is often an important factor, as several species have the ability to express a soluble MMO (sMMO) if the Cu(2+) concentration is low."
5242,"In literature, this enzyme is often described to have a broader compound range for co-metabolic degradation of pollutants, in particular when it comes to aromatic structures."
5243,"However, this study indicated that co-metabolic degradation of the aromatic compounds SMX and BTZ was possible at high Cu(2+) concentration, most probably catalyzed by pMMO.A target screening method using ultra high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) was developed."
5244,"The method was applied to 14 groundwater and 11 surface water samples of a former wastewater infiltration site, where raw wastewater was applied until 1985 and treated wastewater is applied since 2005."
5245,"The measured data are compared with mass spectrometric data of over 2000 organic micropollutants (OMPs), including pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, industrial chemicals and metabolites of these classes."
5246,"A total number of 151 and 159 OMPs were detected in groundwater and surface water, respectively, of which 12 have not been reported before in these matrices."
5247,Among these 12 compounds were 11 pharmaceuticals and one personal care product.
5248,The identity of 55 of the detected OMPs (35%) was verified by analysis of standard compounds.
5249,"Based on the distribution in the study area, two groups of OMPs were clearly distinguished: current OMPs introduced with treated municipal wastewater since 2005 and legacy OMPs originating from infiltration of untreated wastewater until 1985."
5250,A third group included OMPs contained in historic as well as in current wastewater.
5251,"During infiltration, OMPs with molecular mass >500 g/mol and log DOW > 3.9 were preferentially removed."
5252,"Speciation had a strong impact with cationic OMPs showing high, neutral OMPs medium and anionic OMPs lowest elimination during infiltration."
5253,"This target screening method proved useful to study a wide range of compounds, even in retrospect and at sites with poorly documented history and with a complex and variable hydrological situation.The oxidation of organic micro-pollutants by biogenic manganese oxide nanoparticles (BioMnOx) has been studied with respect to possible implementation of BioMnOx in wastewater treatment."
5254,"For this it would be prerequisite that microbial Mn(2+) oxidation and BioMnOx-driven pollutant removal can occur in situ, i.e."
5255,in the same reactor as the removal.
5256,Here we present the in situ reactivity of BioMnOx produced by Pseudomonas putida towards a range of micro-pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations (10 \xce\xbcg L(-1)).
5257,"We found that in situ formed BioMnOx completely removed the steroid hormones estrone and 17-\xce\xb1 ethinylestradiol, while only 26% removal of diclofenac was achieved."
5258,"Ibuprofen, tebuconazole, carbamazepine, carbendazim, and terbutryn were not removed under in situ conditions.Pesticide biodegradation is a soil microbial function of critical importance for modern agriculture and its environmental impact."
5259,"While it was once assumed that this activity was homogeneously distributed at the field scale, mounting evidence indicates that this is rarely the case."
5260,"Here, we critically examine the literature on spatial variability of pesticide biodegradation in agricultural soil."
5261,"We discuss the motivations, methods, and main findings of the primary literature."
5262,"We found significant diversity in the approaches used to describe and quantify spatial heterogeneity, which complicates inter-studies comparisons."
5263,"However, it is clear that the presence and activity of pesticide degraders is often highly spatially variable with coefficients of variation often exceeding 50% and frequently displays non-random spatial patterns."
5264,"A few controlling factors have tentatively been identified across pesticide classes: they include some soil characteristics (pH) and some agricultural management practices (pesticide application, tillage), while other potential controlling factors have more conflicting effects depending on the site or the pesticide."
5265,Evidence demonstrating the importance of spatial heterogeneity on the fate of pesticides in soil has been difficult to obtain but modeling and experimental systems that do not include soil\'s full complexity reveal that this heterogeneity must be considered to improve prediction of pesticide biodegradation rates or of leaching risks.
5266,"Overall, studying the spatial heterogeneity of pesticide biodegradation is a relatively new field at the interface of agronomy, microbial ecology, and geosciences and a wealth of novel data is being collected from these different disciplinary perspectives."
5267,We make suggestions on possible avenues to take full advantage of these investigations for a better understanding and prediction of the fate of pesticides in soil.
5268,"In this study, we collected water from different locations in 32 drinking water distribution networks in the Netherlands and analysed the spatial and temporal variation in microbial community composition by high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons."
5269,We observed that microbial community compositions of raw source and processed water were very different for each distribution network sampled.
5270,"In each network, major differences in community compositions were observed between raw and processed water, although community structures of processed water did not differ substantially from end-point tap water."
5271,End-point water samples within the same distribution network revealed very similar community structures.
5272,Network-specific communities were shown to be surprisingly stable in time.
5273,Biofilm communities sampled from domestic water metres varied distinctly between households and showed no resemblance to planktonic communities within the same distribution networks.
5274,Our findings demonstrate that high-throughput sequencing provides a powerful and sensitive tool to probe microbial community composition in drinking water distribution systems.
5275,"Furthermore, this approach can be used to quantitatively compare the microbial communities to match end-point water samples to specific distribution networks."
5276,Insight in the ecology of drinking water distribution systems will facilitate the development of effective control strategies that will ensure safe and high-quality drinking water.
5277,"Celeribacter indicus P73(T), isolated from deep-sea sediment from the Indian Ocean, is capable of degrading a wide range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and is the first fluoranthene-degrading bacterium within the family Rhodobacteraceae."
5278,"Here, the complete genome sequence of strain P73(T) is presented and analyzed."
5279,"Besides a 4.5-Mb circular chromosome, strain P73(T) carries five plasmids, and encodes 4827 predicted protein-coding sequences."
5280,"One hundred and thirty-eight genes, including 14 dioxygenase genes, were predicted to be involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds, and most of these genes are clustered in four regions."
5281,"P73_0346 is the first fluoranthene 7,8-dioxygenase to be discovered and the first fluoranthene dioxygenase within the toluene/biphenyl family."
5282,"The degradative genes in regions B and D in P73(T) are absent in Celeribacter baekdonensis B30, which cannot degrade PAHs."
5283,"Four intermediate metabolites  of fluoranthene degradation by strain P73(T) were detected as the main intermediates, indicating that the degradation of fluoranthene in P73(T) was initiated by dioxygenation at the C-7,8 positions."
5284,"Based on the genomic and metabolitic results, we propose a C-7,8 dioxygenation pathway in which fluoranthene is mineralized to TCA cycle intermediates."
5285,"Understanding the structure, functions, activities and dynamics of microbial communities in natural environments is one of the grand challenges of 21st century science."
5286,"To address this challenge, over the past decade, numerous technologies have been developed for interrogating microbial communities, of which some are amenable to exploratory work (e.g., high-throughput sequencing and phenotypic screening) and others depend on reference genes or genomes (e.g., phylogenetic and functional gene arrays)."
5287,"Here, we provide a critical review and synthesis of the most commonly applied ""open-format"" and ""closed-format"" detection technologies."
5288,"We discuss their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages within the context of environmental applications and focus on analysis of complex microbial systems, such as those in soils, in which diversity is high and reference genomes are few."
5289,"In addition, we discuss crucial issues and considerations associated with applying complementary high-throughput molecular technologies to address important ecological questions.The use of pesticides in agricultural and urban environments has improved quality of life around the world."
5290,"However, the resulting accumulation of pesticide residues in fresh water resources has negative effects on aquatic ecosystem and human health."
5291,"Bioremediation has been proposed as an environmentally sound alternative for the remediation of pesticide-contaminated water resources, though full-scale implementation has thus far been limited."
5292,One major challenge that has impeded progress is the occurrence of pesticides at low concentrations.
5293,Recent research has improved our fundamental understanding of pesticide biodegradation processes occurring at low concentrations under a variety of environmental scenarios and is expected to contribute to the development of applied bioremediation strategies for pesticide-contaminated water resources.
5294,"Nationwide screening of 411 emerging contaminants and other regulated compounds, including parent molecules and transformation products (TPs) having various uses and origins, was done at 494 groundwater sites throughout France during two sampling campaigns in the Spring and the Fall of 2011."
5295,One hundred and eighty substances (44% of the targeted compounds) were quantified in at least one sampling point.
5296,"These included pharmaceuticals, industrial products, pesticides, their transformation products and other emerging compounds."
5297,Fifty-five compounds were quantified in more than 1% of the samples.
5298,Both regulated and emerging compounds were found.
5299,"Among the unregulated compounds, acetaminophen, carbamazepine, perfluorinated compounds, dioxins/furans, tolyltriazole, bisphenol A, triazine transformation products, and caffeine were quantified in more than 10% of the samples analyzed."
5300,"Concentrations exceeding the threshold of toxicological concern of 0.1 \xce\xbcg/L were found for tolyltriazole, bisphenol A and some of the triazine transformation products (DEDIA)."
5301,"These new results should help the water resource managers and environmental regulators develop sound policies regarding the occurrence and distribution of regulated and emerging contaminants in groundwater.Antibiotic resistance is a threat to human and animal health worldwide, and key measures are required to reduce the risks posed by antibiotic resistance genes that occur in the environment."
5302,"These measures include the identification of critical points of control, the development of reliable surveillance and risk assessment procedures, and the implementation of technological solutions that can prevent environmental contamination with antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes."
5303,"In this Opinion article, we discuss the main knowledge gaps, the future research needs and the policy and management options that should be prioritized to tackle antibiotic resistance in the environment.This paper presents a methodology based on multivariate data analysis for characterizing potential source contributions of emerging contaminants (ECs) detected in 26 river water samples across multi-scape regions during dry and wet seasons."
5304,"Based on this methodology, we unveil an approach toward potential source contributions of ECs, a concept we refer to as the ""Pharmaco-signature."""
5305,"Exploratory analysis of data points has been carried out by unsupervised pattern recognition (hierarchical cluster analysis, HCA) and receptor model (principal component analysis-multiple linear regression, PCA-MLR) in an attempt to demonstrate significant source contributions of ECs in different land-use zone."
5306,Robust cluster solutions grouped the database according to different EC profiles.
5307,"PCA-MLR identified that 58.9% of the mean summed ECs were contributed by domestic impact, 9.7% by antibiotics application, and 31.4% by drug abuse."
5308,"Diclofenac, ibuprofen, codeine, ampicillin, tetracycline, and erythromycin-H2O have significant pollution risk quotients (RQ>1), indicating potentially high risk to aquatic organisms in Taiwan."
5309,"The microbially mediated reactions, that are responsible for field-scale natural attenuation of organic pollutants, are governed by the concurrent presence of a degrading microbial community, suitable energy and carbon sources, electron acceptors, as well as nutrients."
5310,"The temporal lack of one of these essential components for microbial activity, arising from transient environmental conditions, might potentially impair in situ biodegradation."
5311,This study presents results of small scale flow-through experiments aimed at ascertaining the effects of substrate-starvation periods on the aerobic degradation of toluene by Pseudomonas putida F1.
5312,"During the course of the experiments, concentrations of attached and mobile bacteria, as well as toluene and oxygen were monitored."
5313,"Results from a fitted reactive-transport model, along with the observed profiles, show the ability of attached cells to survive substrate-starvation periods of up to four months and suggest a highly dynamic exchange between attached and mobile cells under growth conditions and negligible cell detachment under substrate-starvation conditions."
5314,"Upon reinstatement of toluene, it was readily degraded without a significant lag period, even after a starvation period of 130 days."
5315,Our experimental and modeling results strongly suggest that aerobic biodegradation of BTEX-hydrocarbons at contaminated field sites is not hampered by intermittent starvation periods of up to four months.Groundwater is an important drinking water resource.
5316,"Yet, this resource is threatened by pollution from chemicals, such as pesticides and their degradation products."
5317,"To investigate the potential for remediation of groundwater polluted by trace concentrations of the pesticide residue 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM), we established a pilot waterworks including two sand filters."
5318,The waterworks treated groundwater polluted with 0.2\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/L BAM at flow conditions typical for rapid sand filters.
5319,Bioaugmentation of the sand filter with a specific BAM-degrading bacterium (Aminobacter sp.
5320,"MSH1) resulted in significant BAM degradation to concentrations below the legal threshold level (0.1\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg/L), and this without adverse effects on other sand filter processes such as ammonium and iron oxidation."
5321,"However, efficient degradation for more than 2-3 weeks was difficult to maintain due to loss of MSH1-bacteria, especially during backwashing."
5322,"By limiting backwash procedures, the period of degradation was prolonged, but bacteria (and hence degradation activity) were still lost with time."
5323,Protozoa were observed to grow in the filters to a density that contributed significantly to the general loss of bacteria from the filters.
5324,"Additionally, the concentration of easily assimilable organic carbon (AOC) in the remediated water may have been too low to sustain a sufficient population of degrader bacteria in the filter."
5325,This study shows that scaling up is not trivial and shortcomings in transferring degradation rates obtained in batch experiments to a rapid sand filter system are discussed.
5326,Further optimization is necessary to obtain and control more temporally stable systems for water purification.
5327,"However, for the first time outside the laboratory and at realistic conditions a potential for the biodegradation of recalcitrant micropollutants in bioaugmented rapid sand filters is shown."
5328,This study investigated sorption and biodegradation behaviour of 20 organic micropollutants (OMPs) in lab-scale columns filled with two types of soil (fed with the same water quality) simulating river bank filtration (RBF) under oxic conditions.
5329,"Retardation factors and OMP biodegradation rates were similar for the two soils that were characterised by a different cationic exchange capacity, organic matter and sand/silt/clay content."
5330,"This result was supported by the microbial community composition (richness, evenness) of the two soils that became more similar as a result of feeding both columns with the same water quality."
5331,"This indicates that microbial community composition and thereby OMP removal in soils is primarily determined by the composition of the aqueous phase (organic matter quantity and quality, nutrients) rather than the soil phase."
5332,"These results indicate that different RBF sites located along the same river may show similar OMP removal (in case of similar water quality and residence time).An indigenous bacterial strain capable of utilizing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid as the sole carbon and energy source was isolated from a soil used for grown wheat with a long-term history of herbicide use in Beijing, China."
5333,"The strain BJ71 was identified as Cupriavidus campinensis based on its 16S rRNA sequence analysis and morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics."
5334,The degradation characteristics of strain BJ71 were evaluated.
5335,"The optimal conditions for 2,4-D degradation were as follows: pH 7.0, 30 \xc2\xb0C, 3% (v/v) inoculum size, and an initial 2,4-D concentration of 350 mg L(-1)."
5336,"Up to 99.57% of the 2,4-D was degraded under optimal conditions after 6 days of incubation."
5337,Strain BJ71 was also able to degrade quizalofop and fluroxypyr.
5338,"This is the first report of a 2,4-D-degrader containing tfdA gene that can utilize these two herbicides."
5339,"In a biodegradation experiment, 87.13% and 42.53% of 2,4-D (initial concentration, 350 mg kg(-1)) was degraded in non-sterile and sterilized soil inoculated with BJ71, respectively, after 14 days."
5340,"The 2,4-D degradation was more rapid in a soil microcosm including BJ71 than in a soil microcosm without BJ71."
5341,"These results indicate that strain BJ71 is a potential candidate for the bioremediation of soil contaminated with the herbicide 2,4-D. 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) is a recalcitrant groundwater micropollutant that poses a major problem for drinking water production in European countries."
5342,Aminobacter sp.
5343,MSH1 and related strains have the unique ability to mineralize BAM at micropollutant concentrations but no information exists on the genetics of BAM biodegradation.
5344,"An amidase-BbdA-converting BAM to 2,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (DCBA) was purified from Aminobacter sp."
5345,MSH1.
5346,"Heterologous expression of the corresponding bbdA gene and its absence in MSH1 mutants defective in BAM degradation, confirmed its BAM degrading function."
5347,"BbdA shows low amino acid sequence identity with reported amidases and is encoded by an IncP1-\xce\xb2 plasmid (pBAM1, 40.6 kb) that lacks several genes for conjugation."
5348,BbdA has a remarkably low KM for BAM (0.71 \xce\xbcM) and also shows activity against benzamide and ortho-chlorobenzamide (OBAM).
5349,Differential proteomics and transcriptional reporter analysis suggest the constitutive expression of bbdA in MSH1.
5350,Also in other BAM mineralizing Aminobacter sp.
5351,"strains, bbdA and pBAM1 appear to be involved in BAM degradation."
5352,"BbdA\'s high affinity for BAM and its constitutive expression are of interest for using strain MSH1 in treatment of groundwater containing micropollutant concentrations of BAM for drinking water production.Organic pollutants, including xenobiotics, are often persistent and toxic organic compounds resulting from human activities and released in large amounts into terrestrial, fluvial and marine environments."
5353,"However, some microbial species which are naturally exposed to these compounds in their own habitat are capable of degrading a large range of pollutants, especially poly-aromatic, halogenated and polyester molecules."
5354,These microbes constitute a huge reservoir of enzymes for the diagnosis of pollution and for bioremediation.
5355,"Most are found in highly complex ecosystems like soils, activated sludge, compost or polluted water, and more than 99% have never been cultured."
5356,Meta-omic approaches are thus well suited to retrieve biocatalysts from these environmental samples.
5357,"In this review, we report the latest advances in functional metagenomics aimed at the discovery of enzymes capable of acting on different kinds of polluting molecules."
5358,The University of Minnesota Biocatalysis/Biodegradation Database and Pathway Prediction System (UM-BBD/PPS) has been a unique resource covering microbial biotransformation pathways of primarily xenobiotic chemicals for over 15 years.
5359,"This paper introduces the successor system, enviPath (The Environmental Contaminant Biotransformation Pathway Resource), which is a complete redesign and reimplementation of UM-BBD/PPS."
5360,"enviPath uses the database from the UM-BBD/PPS as a basis, extends the use of this database, and allows users to include their own data to support multiple use cases."
5361,"Relative reasoning is supported for the refinement of predictions and to allow its extensions in terms of previously published, but not implemented machine learning models."
5362,User access is simplified by providing a REST API that simplifies the inclusion of enviPath into existing workflows.
5363,An RDF database is used to enable simple integration with other databases.
5364,enviPath is publicly available at https://envipath.org with free and open access to its core data.
5365,"Ecosystem pollution due to the lack of or inefficient wastewater treatment coverage in small communities is still a matter of great concern, even in developed countries."
5366,"This study assesses the seasonal performance of 4 different full-scale wastewater technologies that have been used in small communities (<2000 population equivalent) for more than 10 years in terms of emerging contaminant (EC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS) and NH4-N removal efficiency."
5367,"The studied technologies, which were selected due to their widespread use, included two intensive treatment systems (an extended aeration system (AS) and a rotating biological contactor (RBC)) and two extensive treatment systems (a constructed wetland (CW) and a waste stabilization pond (WSP)), all located in north-eastern Spain."
5368,"The studied compounds belonged to the groups of pharmaceuticals, sunscreen compounds, fragrances, antiseptics, flame retardants, surfactants, pesticides and plasticizers."
5369,The 25 ECs occurred in wastewater at concentrations ranging from undetectable to 80\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcg\xc2\xa0L(-1).
5370,"The average removal efficiency was 42% for the CW, 62% for the AS, 63% for the RBC and 82% for the WSP."
5371,All the technologies except the WSP system showed seasonal variability in the removal of ECs.
5372,"The ecotoxicological assessment study revealed that, whilst all the technologies were capable of decreasing the aquatic risk, only the WSP yielded no risk in both seasons."
5373,Sewage sludge is an ever-increasing by-product of the wastewater treatment process frequently used as a soil fertiliser.
5374,"To control its quality and prevent any possible hazardous impact of fertilisation, some mandatory limits of heavy metal content have been established by the European Commission (Sewage Sludge Directive)."
5375,"However, since the implementation of the limits, new emerging contaminants have been reported worldwide."
5376,"Regardless of the wastewater treatment process, sewage sludge contains antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes, which can be released into the environment through its land application."
5377,Such a practice may even boost the dissemination and further development of antibiotic resistance phenomenon - already a global problem challenging modern medicine.
5378,"Due to the growing pharmaceutical pollution in the environment, the time is ripe to assess the risk for the human and environmental health of sewage sludge land application in the context of antibiotic resistance spread."
5379,In this review we present the current knowledge in the field and we emphasise the necessity for more studies.
5380,Riparian wetlands are proposed to mitigate diffuse pollution of surface water by pesticides in agricultural landscapes.
5381,"Wetland ecosystems though are highly dynamic environments and seasonal disturbances such as freezing and drying can affect microbial population sizes in the sediment and their functionality including pesticide biodegradation, which has hardly been studied."
5382,"This study examined the effect of artificially induced dry-wet or freeze-thaw events on the mineralization of the pesticides isoproturon (IPU) and 2-methoxy-4-chlorophenoxy acetic acid (MCPA) in wetland microcosms, either without or with prior enrichment of IPU/MCPA degrading populations."
5383,"Without prior enrichment, mineralization of IPU and MCPA was significantly reduced after exposure to especially freeze-thaw events, as evidenced by lower mineralization rates and longer lag times compared to non-exposed microcosms."
5384,"However, herbicide mineralization kinetics correlated poorly with cell numbers of herbicide mineralizers as estimated by a most probable number (MPN) approach and the number of IPU and MCPA mineralizers was unexpectedly higher in freeze-thaw and dry-wet cycle exposed setups compared to the control setups."
5385,This suggested that the observed effects of season-bound disturbances were due to other mechanisms than decay of pesticide mineralizers.
5386,"In addition, in systems in which the growth of pesticide mineralizing bacteria was stimulated by amendment of IPU and MCPA, exposure to a freeze-thaw or dry-wet event only marginally affected the herbicide mineralization kinetics."
5387,Our results show that season bound environmental disturbances can affect pesticide mineralization kinetics in wetlands but that this effect can depend on the history of pesticide applications.The fate of organic micropollutants during long-term/long-distance river bank filtration (RBF) at a temporal scale of several years was investigated along a row of monitoring wells perpendicular to the Lek River (the Netherlands).
5388,"Out of 247 compounds, which were irregularly analyzed in the period 1999-2013, only 15 were detected in both the river and river bank observation wells."
5389,"Out of these, 10 compounds (1,4-dioxan, 1,5-naphthalene disulfonate (1,5-NDS), 2-amino-1,5-NDS, 3-amino-1,5-NDS, AOX, carbamazepine, EDTA, MTBE, toluene and triphenylphosphine oxide) showed fully persistent behavior (showing no concentration decrease at all), even after 3.6 years transit time."
5390,"The remaining 5 compounds (1,3,5-naphthalene trisulfonate (1,3,5-NTS), 1,3,6-NTS, diglyme, iopamidol, triglyme) were partially removed."
5391,"Their reactive transport parameters (removal rate constants/half-lives, retardation coefficients) were inferred from numerical modeling."
5392,"In addition, maximum half-lives for 14 of the fully removed compounds, for which the data availability was sufficient to deduce 100% removal during sub-surface passage, were approximated based on travel times to the nearest well."
5393,The study is one of very few reporting on the long-term field-scale behavior of organic micropollutants.
5394,It highlights the efficiency of RBF for water quality improvement as a pre-treatment step for drinking water production.
5395,"However, it also shows the very persistent behavior of various compounds in groundwater.Domestic drinking water wells serve 44 million people in the US and are common globally."
5396,"They are often located in areas served by onsite wastewater treatment systems, including septic systems, which can be sources of biological and chemical pollutants to groundwater."
5397,"In this study we tested 20 domestic drinking water wells in a sand and gravel aquifer on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, USA, for 117 organic wastewater compounds (OWCs) and for inorganic markers of septic system impact."
5398,"We detected 27 OWCs, including 12 pharmaceuticals, five per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), four organophosphate flame retardants, and an artificial sweetener (acesulfame)."
5399,Maximum concentrations of several PFASs and pharmaceuticals were relatively high compared to public drinking water supplies in the US.
5400,"The number of detected OWCs and total concentrations of pharmaceuticals and of PFASs were positively correlated with nitrate, boron, and acesulfame and negatively correlated with well depth."
5401,"These wells were all located in areas served exclusively by onsite wastewater treatment systems, which are likely the main source of the OWCs in these wells, although landfill leachate may also be a source."
5402,"Our results suggest that current regulations to protect domestic wells from pathogens in septic system discharges do not prevent OWCs from reaching domestic wells, and that nitrate, a commonly measured drinking water contaminant, is a useful screening tool for OWCs in domestic wells."
5403,"Nitrate concentrations of 1mg/L NO3-N, which are tenfold higher than local background and tenfold lower than the US federal drinking water standard, were associated with wastewater impacts from OWCs in this study."
5404,Soils contaminated with crude oil are rich sources of enzymes suitable for both degradation of hydrocarbons through bioremediation processes and improvement of crude oil during its refining steps.
5405,"Due to the long term selection, crude oil fields are unique environments for the identification of microorganisms with the ability to produce these enzymes."
5406,"In this metagenomic study, based on Hiseq Illumina sequencing of samples obtained from a crude oil field and analysis of data on MG-RAST, Actinomycetales (9.8%) were found to be the dominant microorganisms, followed by Rhizobiales (3.3%)."
5407,"Furthermore, several functional genes were found in this study, mostly belong to Actinobacteria (12.35%), which have a role in the metabolism of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (2.51%), desulfurization (0.03%), element shortage (5.6%), and resistance to heavy metals (1.1%)."
5408,This information will be useful for assisting in the application of microorganisms in the removal of hydrocarbon contamination and/or for improving the quality of crude oil.

5410,"Prog., 32:638-648, 2016.Phenol is a ubiquitous organic contaminant in drinking water."
5411,"Biodegradation plays an important role in the elimination of phenol pollution in the environment, but the information about phenol removal by drinking water biofilters is still lacking."
5412,"Herein, we study an acclimated bacterial community that can degrade over 80% of 300 mg/L phenol within 3 days."
5413,"PCR detection of genotypes involved in bacterial phenol degradation revealed that the degradation pathways contained the initial oxidative attack by phenol hydroxylase, and subsequent ring fission by catechol 1,2-dioxygenase."
5414,"Based on the PCR denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) profiles of bacteria from biological activated carbon (BAC), the predominant bacteria in drinking water biofilters including Delftia sp., Achromobacter sp., and Agrobacterium sp., which together comprised up to 50% of the total microorganisms."
5415,"In addition, a shift in bacterial community structure was observed during phenol biodegradation."
5416,"Furthermore, the most effective phenol-degrading strain DW-1 that correspond to the main band in denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profile was isolated and identified as Acinetobacter sp., according to phylogenetic analyses of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene sequences."
5417,"The strain DW-1 also produced the most important enzyme, phenol hydroxylase, and it also exhibited a good ability to degrade phenol when immobilized on granular active carbon (GAC)."
5418,"This study indicates that the enrichment culture has great potential application for treatment of phenol-polluted drinking water sources, and the indigenous phenol-degrading microorganism could recover from drinking water biofilters as an efficient resource for phenol removal."
5419,"Therefore, the aim of this study is to draw attention to recover native phenol-degrading bacteria from drinking water biofilters, and use these native microorganisms as phenolic water remediation in drinking water sources."
5420,This study was conducted to investigate whether functions encoded in the metagenome could improve our ability to understand the link between microbial community structures and functions in activated sludge.
5421,"By analyzing data sets from six industrial and six municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), covering different configurations, operational conditions, and geographic regions, we found that wastewater influent composition was an overriding factor shaping the metagenomic composition of the activated sludge samples."
5422,Community GC content profiles were conserved within treatment plants on a time scale of years and between treatment plants with similar influent wastewater types.
5423,"Interestingly, GC contents of the represented phyla covaried with the average GC contents of the corresponding WWTP metagenome."
5424,This suggests that the factors influencing nucleotide composition act similarly across taxa and thus the variation in nucleotide contents is driven by environmental differences between WWTPs.
5425,"While taxonomic richness and functional richness were correlated, shotgun metagenomics complemented taxon-based analyses in the task of classifying microbial communities involved in wastewater treatment systems."
5426,"The observed taxonomic dissimilarity between full-scale WWTPs receiving influent types with varied compositions, as well as the inferred taxonomic and functional assignment of recovered genomes from each metagenome, were consistent with underlying differences in the abundance of distinctive sets of functional categories."
5427,"These conclusions were robust with respect to plant configuration, operational and environmental conditions, and even differences in laboratory protocols.With the rapid advances in sequencing technology, the cost of sequencing has dramatically dropped and the scale of sequencing projects has increased accordingly."
5428,This has provided the opportunity for the routine use of sequencing techniques in the monitoring of environmental microbes.
5429,"While metagenomic applications have been routinely applied to better understand the ecology and diversity of microbes, their use in environmental monitoring and bioremediation is increasingly common."
5430,"In this review we seek to provide an overview of some of the metagenomic techniques used in environmental systems biology, addressing their application and limitation."
5431,We will also provide several recent examples of the application of metagenomics to bioremediation.
5432,"We discuss examples where microbial communities have been used to predict the presence and extent of contamination, examples of how metagenomics can be used to characterize the process of natural attenuation by unculturable microbes, as well as examples detailing the use of metagenomics to understand the impact of biostimulation on microbial communities.Pesticide-polluted drinking water may be remediated by inoculating waterworks sand filters with specific degrading bacteria."
5433,"However, degradation efficiency is often hampered by the poor adhesion behaviour of the introduced bacteria."
5434,The phenoxy acid herbicide 4-chloro-2-methyl-phenoxy-acetic acid (MCPA) is a widespread groundwater contaminant.
5435,The aim of this study was to investigate whether specific surface characteristics of MCPA-degrading bacteria could be linked to their degrading capabilities in sand filters.
5436,Four MCPA degraders with different taxonomic affiliations and original habitats (Sphingomonas sp.
5437,"PM2, Sphingomonas sp."
5438,"ERG5, Burkholderia sp."
5439,"TFD34, Cupriavidus sp."
5440,"TFD38) were characterised with regard to their motility, cell surface hydrophobicity, biofilm formation, adhesion behaviour and ability to mineralise MCPA."
5441,"Strains PM2 and ERG5 were non-motile and hydrophobic, whilst strains TFD34 and TFD38 were motile and less hydrophobic."
5442,"All the strains except ERG5 showed low biofilm formation on polystyrene, although it was significantly higher on glass."
5443,PM2 was the most efficient MCPA degrader as it displayed no lag phase and reached >50\xc2\xa0% mineralisation at all concentrations (0.0016-25\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L<sup>-1</sup>).
5444,PM2 adhered significantly better to sand than the other strains.
5445,"No link was found between motility, biofilm formation and the ability to adhere to sand."
5446,PM2 completely removed MCPA for 14\xc2\xa0days when inoculated in sand columns with a constant inlet of 1\xc2\xa0mg\xc2\xa0L<sup>-1</sup> MCPA.
5447,"These results demonstrate that besides the ability to degrade the contaminant, surface hydrophobicity and adherence abilities are significant parameters controlling sustained degradation in flow-through sand columns and must be considered when selecting bacteria for bioaugmentation.Polluted environments are a reservoir of microbial species able to degrade or to convert pollutants to harmless compounds."
5448,The proper management of microbial resources requires a comprehensive characterization of their genetic pool to assess the fate of contaminants and increase the efficiency of bioremediation processes.
5449,Metagenomics offers appropriate tools to describe microbial communities in their whole complexity without lab-based cultivation of individual strains.
5450,"After a decade of use of metagenomics to study microbiomes, the scientific community has made significant progress in this field."
5451,"In this review, we survey the main steps of metagenomics applied to environments contaminated with organic compounds or heavy metals."
5452,We emphasize technical solutions proposed to overcome encountered obstacles.
5453,"We then compare two metagenomic approaches, i.e."
5454,library-based targeted metagenomics and direct sequencing of metagenomes.
5455,"In the former, environmental DNA is cloned inside a host, and then clones of interest are selected based on (i) their expression of biodegradative functions or (ii) sequence homology with probes and primers designed from relevant, already known sequences."
5456,The highest score for the discovery of novel genes and degradation pathways has been achieved so far by functional screening of large clone libraries.
5457,"On the other hand, direct sequencing of metagenomes without a cloning step has been more often applied to polluted environments for characterization of the taxonomic and functional composition of microbial communities and their dynamics."
5458,"In this case, the analysis has focused on 16S rRNA genes and marker genes of biodegradation."
5459,"Advances in next generation sequencing and in bioinformatic analysis of sequencing data have opened up new opportunities for assessing the potential of biodegradation by microbes, but annotation of collected genes is still hampered by a limited number of available reference sequences in databases."
5460,"Although metagenomics is still facing technical and computational challenges, our review of the recent literature highlights its value as an aid to efficiently monitor the clean-up of contaminated environments and develop successful strategies to mitigate the impact of pollutants on ecosystems.Environmental assessment of complex mixtures typically requires integration of chemical and biological measurements."
5461,"This study demonstrates the use of a combination of instrumental chemical analyses, effects-based monitoring, and bio-effects prediction approaches to help identify potential hazards and priority contaminants in two Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs), the Lower Green Bay/Fox River located near Green Bay, WI, USA and the Milwaukee Estuary, located near Milwaukee, WI, USA."
5462,Fathead minnows were caged at four sites within each AOC (eight sites total).
5463,"Following 4d of in situ exposure, tissues and biofluids were sampled and used for targeted biological effects analyses."
5464,"Additionally, 4d composite water samples were collected concurrently at each caged fish site and analyzed for 132 analytes as well as evaluated for total estrogenic and androgenic activity using cell-based bioassays."
5465,"Of the analytes examined, 75 were detected in composite samples from at least one site."
5466,"Based on multiple analyses, one site in the East River and another site near a paper mill discharge in the Lower Green Bay/Fox River AOC, were prioritized due to their estrogenic and androgenic activity, respectively."
5467,"The water samples from other sites generally did not exhibit significant estrogenic or androgenic activity, nor was there evidence for endocrine disruption in the fish exposed at these sites as indicated by the lack of alterations in ex vivo steroid production, circulating steroid concentrations, or vitellogenin mRNA expression in males."
5468,"Induction of hepatic cyp1a mRNA expression was detected at several sites, suggesting the presence of chemicals that activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor."
5469,"To expand the scope beyond targeted investigation of endpoints selected a priori, several bio-effects prediction approaches were employed to identify other potentially disturbed biological pathways and related chemical constituents that may warrant future monitoring at these sites."
5470,"For example, several chemicals such as diethylphthalate and naphthalene, and genes and related pathways, such as cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3 (CHRM3), estrogen receptor alpha1 (esr1), chemokine ligand 10 protein (CXCL10), tumor protein p53 (p53), and monoamine oxidase B (Maob), were identified as candidates for future assessments at these AOCs."
5471,"Overall, this study demonstrates that a better prioritization of contaminants and associated hazards can be achieved through integrated evaluation of multiple lines of evidence."
5472,"Such prioritization can guide more comprehensive follow-up risk assessment efforts.Network reconstruction procedures based on meta-""omics"" data are an invaluable tool for inferring total and active set of reactions mediated by different members in a microbial community."
5473,"Within them, network-based methods for automatic analysis of catabolic capacities in metagenomes are currently limited."
5474,"Here, we describe the complete workflow, scripts, and commands allowing the automatic reconstruction of biodegradation networks using as an input meta-sequences generated by direct DNA sequencing.The occurrence of pesticides in soil has become a highly significant environmental problem, which has been increased by the vast use of pesticides worldwide and the absence of remediation technologies that have been tested at full-scale."
5475,The aim of this review is to give an overview on technologies really studied and/or developed during the last years for remediation of soils contaminated by pesticides.
5476,"Depending on the nature of the decontamination process, these techniques have been included into three categories: containment-immobilization, separation or destruction."
5477,"The review includes some considerations about the status of emerging technologies as well as their advantages, limitations, and pesticides treated."
5478,"In most cases, emerging technologies, such as those based on oxidation-reduction or bioremediation, may be incorporated into existing technologies to improve their performance or overcome limitations."
5479,"Research and development actions are still needed for emerging technologies to bring them for full-scale implementation.Thiocyanate (SCN<sup>-</sup> ) is a toxic compound that forms when cyanide (CN<sup>-</sup> ), used to recover gold, reacts with sulfur species."
5480,"SCN<sup>-</sup> -degrading microbial communities have been studied, using bioreactors fed synthetic wastewater."
5481,"The inclusion of suspended solids in the form of mineral tailings, during the development of the acclimatized microbial consortium, led to the selection of an active planktonic microbial community."
5482,Preliminary analysis of the community composition revealed reduced microbial diversity relative to the laboratory-based reactors operated without suspended solids.
5483,"Despite minor upsets during the acclimation period, the SCN<sup>-</sup> degradation performance was largely unchanged under stable operating conditions."
5484,"Here, we characterized the microbial community in the SCN<sup>-</sup> degrading bioreactor that included solid particulate tailings and determined how it differed from the biofilm-based communities in solids-free reactor systems inoculated from the same source."
5485,"Genome-based analysis revealed that the presence of solids decreased microbial diversity, selected for different strains, suppressed growth of thiobacilli inferred to be primarily responsible for SCN<sup>-</sup> degradation, and promoted growth of Trupera, an organism not detected in the reactors without solids."
5486,"In the solids reactor community, heterotrophy and aerobic respiration represent the dominant metabolisms."
5487,"Many organisms have genes for denitrification and sulfur oxidation, but only one Thiobacillus sp."
5488,in the solids reactor has SCN<sup>-</sup> degradation genes.
5489,"The presence of the solids prevented floc and biofilm formation, leading to the observed reduced microbial diversity."
5490,"Collectively the presence of the solids and lack of biofilm community may result in a process with reduced resilience to process perturbations, including fluctuations in the influent composition and pH."
5491,"The results from this investigation have provided novel insights into the community composition of this industrially relevant community, giving potential for improved process control and operation through ongoing process monitoring.Benzene is an aromatic compound and harmful for the environment."
5492,Biodegradation of benzene can reduce the toxicological risk after accidental or controlled release of this chemical in the environment.
5493,"In this study, we further characterized an anaerobic continuous biofilm culture grown for more than 14\xc2\xa0years on benzene with nitrate as electron acceptor."
5494,"We determined steady state degradation rates, microbial community composition dynamics in the biofilm, and the initial anaerobic benzene degradation reactions."
5495,Benzene was degraded at a rate of 0.15\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcmol/mg\xc2\xa0protein/day and a first-order rate constant of 3.04/day which was fourfold higher than rates reported previously.
5496,"Bacteria belonging to the Peptococcaceae were found to play an important role in this anaerobic benzene-degrading biofilm culture, but also members of the Anaerolineaceae were predicted to be involved in benzene degradation or benzene metabolite degradation based on Illumina MiSeq analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA genes."
5497,Biomass retention in the reactor using a filtration finger resulted in reduction of benzene degradation capacity.
5498,"Detection of the benzene carboxylase encoding gene, abcA, and benzoic acid in the culture vessel indicated that benzene degradation proceeds through an initial carboxylation step.<i>Aminobacter</i> sp."
5499,"strain MSH1 grows on and mineralizes the groundwater micropollutant 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) and is of interest for BAM removal in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs)."
5500,"The BAM-catabolic genes in MSH1 are located on plasmid pBAM1, carrying <i>bbdA</i>, which encodes the conversion of BAM to 2,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (2,6-DCBA) (BbdA<sup>+</sup> phenotype), and plasmid pBAM2, carrying gene clusters encoding the conversion of 2,6-DCBA to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (Dcba<sup>+</sup> phenotype)."
5501,There are indications that MSH1 easily loses its BAM-catabolic phenotype.
5502,We obtained evidence that MSH1 rapidly develops a population that lacks the ability to mineralize BAM when grown on nonselective (R2B medium) and semiselective (R2B medium with BAM) media.
5503,Lack of mineralization was explained by loss of the Dcba<sup>+</sup> phenotype and corresponding genes.
5504,The ecological significance of this instability for the use of MSH1 for BAM removal in the oligotrophic environment of DWTPs was explored in lab and pilot systems.
5505,A higher incidence of BbdA<sup>+</sup> Dcba<sup>-</sup> MSH1 cells was also observed when MSH1 was grown as a biofilm in flow chambers under C and N starvation conditions due to growth on nonselective residual assimilable organic carbon.
5506,Similar observations were made in experiments with a pilot sand filter reactor bioaugmented with MSH1.
5507,"BAM conversion to 2,6-DCBA was not affected by loss of the DCBA-catabolic genes."
5508,Our results show that MSH1 is prone to BAM-catabolic instability under the conditions occurring in a DWTP.
5509,"While conversion of BAM to 2,6-DCBA remains unaffected, BAM mineralization activity is at risk, and monitoring of metabolites is warranted.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Bioaugmentation of dedicated biofiltration units with bacterial strains that grow on and mineralize micropollutants was suggested as an alternative for treating micropollutant-contaminated water in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs)."
5510,"Organic-pollutant-catabolic genes in bacteria are often easily lost, especially under nonselective conditions, which affects the bioaugmentation success."
5511,"In this study, we provide evidence that <i>Aminobacter</i> sp."
5512,"strain MSH1, which uses the common groundwater micropollutant 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) as a C source, shows a high frequency of loss of its BAM-mineralizing phenotype due to the loss of genes that convert 2,6-DCBA to Krebs cycle intermediates when nonselective conditions occur."
5513,"Moreover, we show that catabolic-gene loss also occurs in the oligotrophic environment of DWTPs, where growth of MSH1 depends mainly on the high fluxes of low concentrations of assimilable organic carbon, and hence show the ecological relevance of catabolic instability for using strain MSH1 for BAM removal in DWTPs.A culture-independent function-based screening approach was used to assess the microbial aerobic catabolome for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons degradation of a soil subjected to 12 years of in situ bioremediation."
5514,"A total of 422\xc2\xa0750 fosmid clones were screened for key aromatic ring-cleavage activities using 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl as substrate."
5515,"Most of the genes encoding ring-cleavage enzymes on the 768 retrieved positive fosmids could not be identified using primer-based approaches and, thus, 205 fosmid inserts were sequenced."
5516,Nearly two hundred extradiol dioxygenase encoding genes of three different superfamilies could be identified.
5517,"Additional key genes of aromatic metabolic pathways were identified, including a high abundance of Rieske non-heme iron oxygenases that provided detailed information on enzymes activating aromatic compounds and enzymes involved in activation of the side chain of methylsubstituted aromatics."
5518,"The gained insights indicated a complex microbial network acting at the site under study, which comprises organisms similar to recently identified Immundisolibacter cernigliae TR3.2 and Rugosibacter aromaticivorans Ca6 and underlined the great potential of an approach that combines an activity-screening, a cost-effective high-throughput sequencing of fosmid clones and a phylogenomic-routed and manually curated database to carefully identify key proteins dedicated to aerobic degradation of aromatic compounds.The pesticide metabolite 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) is very persistent in both soil and groundwater and has become one of the most frequently detected groundwater micropollutants."
5519,"BAM is not removed by the physico-chemical treatment techniques currently used in drinking water treatment plants (DWTP); therefore, if concentrations exceed the legal threshold limit, it represents a sizeable problem for the stability and quality of drinking water production, especially in places that depend on groundwater for drinking water."
5520,Bioremediation is suggested as a valuable strategy for removing BAM from groundwater by deploying dedicated BAM-degrading bacteria in DWTP sand filters.
5521,"Only a few bacterial strains with the capability to degrade BAM have been isolated, and of these, only three isolates belonging to the Aminobacter genus are able to mineralise BAM."
5522,"Considerable effort has been made to elucidate degradation pathways, kinetics and degrader genes, and research has recently been presented on the application of strain Aminobacter sp."
5523,MSH1 for the purification of BAM-contaminated water.
5524,The aim of the present review was to provide insight into the issue of BAM contamination and to report on the current status and knowledge with regard to the application of microorganisms for purification of BAM-contaminated water resources.
5525,This paper discusses the prospects and challenges for bioaugmentation of DWTP sand filters with specific BAM-degrading bacteria and identifies relevant perspectives for future research.We examined whether contaminants present in surface waters could be prioritized for further assessment by linking the presence of specific chemicals to gene expression changes in exposed fish.
5526,"Fathead minnows were deployed in cages for 2, 4, or 8 days at three locations near two different wastewater treatment plant discharge sites in the Saint Louis Bay, Duluth, MN and one upstream reference site."
5527,"The biological impact of 51 chemicals detected in the surface water of 133 targeted chemicals was determined using biochemical endpoints, exposure activity ratios for biological and estrogenic responses, known chemical:gene interactions from biological pathways and knowledge bases, and analysis of the covariance of ovary gene expression with surface water chemistry."
5528,Thirty-two chemicals were significantly linked by covariance with expressed genes.
5529,No estrogenic impact on biochemical endpoints was observed in male or female minnows.
5530,"However, bisphenol A (BPA) was identified by chemical:gene covariation as the most impactful estrogenic chemical across all exposure sites."
5531,"This was consistent with identification of estrogenic effects on gene expression, high BPA exposure activity ratios across all test sites, and historical analysis of the study area."
5532,Gene expression analysis also indicated the presence of nontargeted chemicals including chemotherapeutics consistent with a local hospital waste stream.
5533,Overall impacts on gene expression appeared to be related to changes in treatment plant function during rain events.
5534,This approach appears useful in examining the impacts of complex mixtures on fish and offers a potential route in linking chemical exposure to adverse outcomes that may reduce population sustainability.More than 50% of pharmaceuticals in current use are chiral compounds.
5535,"Enantiomers of the same pharmaceutical have identical physicochemical properties, but may exhibit differences in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and toxicity."
5536,The advancement in separation and detection methods has made it possible to analyze trace amounts of chiral compounds in environmental media.
5537,"As a result, interest on chiral analysis and evaluation of stereoselectivity in environmental occurrence, phase distribution and degradation of chiral pharmaceuticals has grown substantially in recent years."
5538,"Here we review recent studies on the analysis, occurrence, and fate of chiral pharmaceuticals in engineered and natural environments."
5539,"Monitoring studies have shown ubiquitous presence of chiral pharmaceuticals in wastewater, surface waters, sediments, and sludge, particularly \xce\xb2-receptor antagonists, analgesics, antifungals, and antidepressants."
5540,Selective sorption and microbial degradation have been demonstrated to result in enrichment of one enantiomer over the other.
5541,The changes in enantiomer composition may also be caused by biologically catalyzed chiral inversion.
5542,"However, accurate evaluation of chiral pharmaceuticals as trace environmental pollutants is often hampered by the lack of identification of the stereoconfiguration of enantiomers."
5543,"Furthermore, a systematic approach including occurrence, fate and transport in various environmental matrices is needed to minimize uncertainties in risk assessment of chiral pharmaceuticals as emerging environmental contaminants.Environmental pollution from hazardous waste materials, organic pollutants and heavy metals, has adversely affected the natural ecosystem to the detriment of man."
5544,These pollutants arise from anthropogenic sources as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes and volcanic eruptions.
5545,"Toxic metals could accumulate in agricultural soils and get into the food chain, thereby becoming a major threat to food security."
5546,Conventional and physical methods are expensive and not effective in areas with low metal toxicity.
5547,Bioremediation is therefore an eco-friendly and efficient method of reclaiming environments contaminated with heavy metals by making use of the inherent biological mechanisms of microorganisms and plants to eradicate hazardous contaminants.
5548,This review discusses the toxic effects of heavy metal pollution and the mechanisms used by microbes and plants for environmental remediation.
5549,"It also emphasized the importance of modern biotechnological techniques and approaches in improving the ability of microbial enzymes to effectively degrade heavy metals at a faster rate, highlighting recent advances in microbial bioremediation and phytoremediation for the removal of heavy metals from the environment as well as future prospects and limitations."
5550,"However, strict adherence to biosafety regulations must be followed in the use of biotechnological methods to ensure safety of the environment.Halogenated organic compounds, also termed organohalogens, were initially considered to be of almost exclusively anthropogenic origin."
5551,"However, over 5000 naturally synthesized organohalogens are known today."
5552,"This has also fuelled the hypothesis that the natural and ancient origin of organohalogens could have primed development of metabolic machineries for\xc2\xa0their degradation, especially in microorganisms."
5553,"Among these, a special group of anaerobic microorganisms was discovered that could conserve energy by reducing organohalogens as terminal electron acceptor in a process termed organohalide respiration."
5554,"Originally discovered in a quest for biodegradation of anthropogenic organohalogens, these organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) were soon found to reside in pristine environments, such as the deep subseafloor and Arctic tundra soil with limited/no connections to anthropogenic activities."
5555,"As such, accumulating evidence suggests an important role of OHRB in local natural halogen cycles, presumably taking advantage of natural organohalogens."
5556,"In this minireview, we integrate current knowledge regarding the natural origin and occurrence of industrially important organohalogens and the evolution and spread of OHRB, and describe potential implications for natural halogen and carbon cycles.The increasing use of biobased fuels and fuel additives can potentially change the typical fuel-related contamination in soil and groundwater."
5557,"Anaerobic biotransformation of the biofuel additive ethyl tert-butyl ether (EtBE), as well as of methyl tert-butyl ether (MtBE), benzene, and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, a possible oxygenate metabolite), was studied at an industrially contaminated site and in the laboratory."
5558,"Analysis of groundwater samples indicated that in the field MtBE was degraded, yielding TBA as major product."
5559,"In batch microcosms, MtBE was degraded under different conditions: unamended control, with medium without added electron acceptors, or with ferrihydrite or sulfate (with or without medium) as electron acceptor, respectively."
5560,Degradation of EtBE was not observed under any of these conditions tested.
5561,TBA was partially depleted in parallel with MtBE.
5562,"Results of microcosm experiments with MtBE substrate analogues, i.e., syringate, vanillate, or ferulate, were in line with the hypothesis that the observed TBA degradation is a cometabolic process."
5563,"Microcosms with ferulate, syringate, isopropanol, or diethyl ether showed EtBE depletion up to 86.5% of the initial concentration after 83\xc2\xa0days."
5564,"Benzene was degraded in the unamended controls, with medium without added electron acceptors and with ferrihydrite, sulfate, or chlorate as electron acceptor, respectively."
5565,"In the presence of nitrate, benzene was only degraded after addition of an anaerobic benzene-degrading community."
5566,"Nitrate and chlorate hindered MtBE, EtBE, and TBA degradation.Prokaryotes in natural environments respond rapidly to high concentrations of chemicals and physical stresses."
5567,"Exposure to anthropogenic toxic substances-such as oil, chlorinated solvents, or antibiotics-favors the evolution of resistant phenotypes, some of which can use contaminants as an exclusive carbon source or as electron donors and acceptors."
5568,"Microorganisms similarly adapt to extreme pH, metal, or osmotic stress."
5569,"The metabolic plasticity of prokaryotes can thus be harnessed for bioremediation and can be exploited in a variety of ways, ranging from stimulated natural attenuation to bioaugmentation and from wastewater treatment to habitat restoration.Antibiotics and hormones are among the most concerning trace contaminants in the environment."
5570,"Therefore, the present work aimed to identify anaerobic microorganisms with the ability to remove pharmaceutical products (PhPs) belonging to these two classes (ciprofloxacin, 17\xce\xb2-estradiol and sulfamethoxazole) under different anaerobic conditions, and to elucidate the bio-removal mechanisms involved."
5571,"Ciprofloxacin was efficiently biodegraded under both nitrate- and sulfate-reducing conditions reaching a PhP removal superior to 80%, whereas 17\xce\xb2-estradiol was only biodegraded under nitrate-reducing conditions reaching a removal of 84%."
5572,No biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole was observed.
5573,"In nitrate-reducing conditions the ciprofloxacin-degrading community was composed of Comamonas, Arcobacter, Dysgonomonas, Macellibacteroides and Actinomyces, genera while Comamonas and Castellaniella were the main bacteria present in the 17\xce\xb2-estradiol-degrading community."
5574,"In sulfate-reducing conditions the community was mainly composed by bacteria affiliated to Desulfovibrio, Enterococcus and Peptostreeptococcus."
5575,"Interestingly, the PhP under study were biodegraded even in the absence of additional carbon source, with 85% of ciprofloxacin removed under sulfate-reducing conditions and 62% and 83% of ciprofloxacin and estradiol removed, respectively, under nitrate-reducing conditions."
5576,This work provides new insights into anaerobic bioremediation of PhP and novel PhP-degrading bacteria.Rapid industrialization and population explosion has resulted in the generation and dumping of various contaminants into the environment.
5577,These harmful compounds deteriorate the human health as well as the surrounding environments.
5578,Current research aims to harness and enhance the natural ability of different microbes to metabolize these toxic compounds.
5579,Microbial-mediated bioremediation offers great potential to reinstate the contaminated environments in an ecologically acceptable approach.
5580,"However, the lack of the knowledge regarding the factors controlling and regulating the growth, metabolism, and dynamics of diverse microbial communities in the contaminated environments often limits its execution."
5581,"In recent years the importance of advanced tools such as genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and fluxomics has increased to design the strategies to treat these contaminants in ecofriendly manner."
5582,"Previously researchers has largely focused on the environmental remediation using single omics-approach, however the present review specifically addresses the integrative role of the multi-omics approaches in microbial-mediated bioremediation."
5583,"Additionally, we discussed how the multi-omics approaches help to comprehend and explore the structural and functional aspects of the microbial consortia in response to the different environmental pollutants and presented some success stories by using these approaches.In agricultural landscapes honeybees and other pollinators are exposed to pesticides, often surveyed by residue analysis of bee bread."
5584,"However, bee bread is a mixture of pollen pellets of different plants collected over a longer time period."
5585,"Therefore, pesticide content in the hive varies with plant species and time of pollen collection."
5586,"Hence, the analysis of bee bread is an approximate approach to gain information on detailed pesticide exposure during the agronomic active season."
5587,"As high-resolution data is missing, we carried out a pesticide residue survey over five years (2012-2016) of daily collected pollen pellets at three agricultural distinct sites in southern Germany."
5588,281 single day pollen samples were selected and subjected to a multi-pesticide residue analysis.
5589,Pesticide contaminations of pollen differed between the sites.
5590,Intensive pesticide exposure can be seen by high pesticide concentrations as well as a high amount of different pesticides detected.
5591,"During the five years of observation 73 different pesticides were found, of which 84% are characterized as non-harmful to honeybees."
5592,"To estimate pesticide risks for honeybees, the pollen hazard quotient (PHQ) was calculated."
5593,"Even though pesticides were detected in sublethal concentrations, we found substances not supposed to be exposed to honey bees, indicating the necessity for further improvement of seed treatments and increasing awareness of flowering shrubs, field margins and pesticide drift."
5594,"Additionally, an in-depth analysis of nine pollen samples, divided into sub-fractions dominated by single plant species, revealed even higher concentrations in single crops for some pesticides."
5595,"We give precise residue data of 1,657 single pesticide detections, which should be used for realistic laboratory and field tests.Anaerobic degradation processes are very important to attenuate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in saturated, anoxic sediments."
5596,"However, PAHs are poorly degradable, leading to very slow microbial growth and thus resulting in only a few cultures that have been enriched and studied so far."
5597,"Here, we report on a new phenanthrene-degrading, sulfate-reducing enrichment culture, TRIP1."
5598,"Genome-resolved metagenomics and strain specific cell counting with FISH and flow cytometry indicated that the culture is dominated by a microorganism belonging to the Desulfobacteraceae family (60% of the community) and sharing 93% 16S rRNA sequence similarity to the naphthalene-degrading, sulfate-reducing strain NaphS2."
5599,The anaerobic degradation pathway was studied by metabolite analyses and revealed phenanthroic acid as the major intermediate consistent with carboxylation as the initial activation reaction.
5600,Further reduced metabolites were indicative of a stepwise reduction of the ring system.
5601,"We were able to measure the presumed second enzyme reaction in the pathway, phenanthroate-CoA ligase, in crude cell extracts."
5602,The reaction was specific for 2-phenanthroic acid and did not transform other isomers.
5603,The present study provides first insights into the anaerobic degradation pathways of three-ringed PAHs.
5604,"The biochemical strategy follows principles known from anaerobic naphthalene degradation, including carboxylation and reduction of the aromatic ring system.Activated sludge (AS) has been regarded as the main driver in the removal of organic pollutants such as pesticides due to a high diversity and abundance of microorganisms."
5605,"However, little is known about the biodegradation genes (BDGs) and pesticide degradation genes (PDGs) harbored in the AS from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)."
5606,"In this study, we explored the bacterial communities and BDGs/PDGs in the AS from five WWTPs affiliated with pesticide factories across four consecutive seasons based on high-throughput sequencing."
5607,The AS in pesticide WWTPs exhibited unique bacterial taxa at the genus level.
5608,"Furthermore, a total of 17 BDGs and 68 PDGs were explored with a corresponding average relative abundance of 0.002-0.046% and 2.078-7.143% in each AS sample, respectively, and some BDGs/PDGs clusters were also identified in the AS."
5609,"The bacterial communities and BDGs/PDGs were season-dependent, and the total variations of 50.4% and 76.8% were jointly explained by environmental variables (pesticide types, wastewater characteristics, and temperature)."
5610,"In addition, network analysis and distribution patterns suggested that the potential hosts of BDGs/PDGs were Thauera, Stenotrophomonas, Mycobacterium, Hyphomicrobium, Allochromatium, Ralstonia, and Dechloromonas."
5611,"Our findings demonstrated the linkages of bacterial communities and BDGs/PDGs in the AS, and depended on the seasons and the pesticide wastewater characteristics.Syntrophorhabdus aromaticivorans is a syntrophically fermenting bacterium that can degrade isophthalate (3-carboxybenzoate)."
5612,It is a xenobiotic compound which has accumulated in the environment for more than 50 years due to its global industrial usage and can cause negative effects on the environment.
5613,"Isophthalate degradation by the strictly anaerobic S. aromaticivorans was investigated to advance our understanding of the degradation of xenobiotics introduced into nature, and to identify enzymes that might have ecological significance for bioremediation."
5614,Differential proteome analysis of isophthalate- vs benzoate-grown cells revealed over 400 differentially expressed proteins of which only four were unique to isophthalate-grown cells.
5615,"The isophthalate-induced proteins include a phenylacetate:CoA ligase, a UbiD-like decarboxylase, a UbiX-like flavin prenyltransferase, and a hypothetical protein."
5616,These proteins are encoded by genes forming a single gene cluster that putatively codes for anaerobic conversion of isophthalate to benzoyl-CoA.
5617,"Subsequently, benzoyl-CoA is metabolized by the enzymes of\xc2\xa0the anaerobic benzoate degradation pathway that were identified in the proteomic analysis."
5618,"In vitro enzyme assays with cell-free extracts of isophthalate-grown cells indicated that isophthalate is activated to isophthalyl-CoA by an ATP-dependent isophthalate:CoA ligase (IPCL), and subsequently decarboxylated to benzoyl-CoA by a UbiD family isophthalyl-CoA decarboxylase (IPCD) that requires a prenylated flavin mononucleotide (prFMN) cofactor supplied by UbiX to effect decarboxylation."
5619,Phylogenetic analysis revealed that IPCD is a novel member of the functionally diverse UbiD family (de)carboxylases.
5620,"Homologs of the IPCD encoding genes are found in several other bacteria, such as aromatic compound-degrading denitrifiers, marine sulfate-reducers, and methanogenic communities in a terephthalate-degrading reactor."
5621,"These results suggest that metabolic strategies adapted for degradation of isophthalate and other phthalate are conserved between microorganisms that are involved in the anaerobic degradation of environmentally relevant aromatic compounds.<b>Background:\xc2\xa0</b>Massive high-throughput sequencing of short, hypervariable segments of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene has transformed the methodological landscape describing microbial diversity within and across complex biomes."
5622,"However, several studies have shown that the methodology rather than the biological variation is responsible for the observed sample composition and distribution."
5623,"This compromises meta-analyses, although this fact is often disregarded."
5624,"<b>Results:\xc2\xa0</b>To facilitate true meta-analysis of microbiome studies, we developed NG-Tax, a pipeline for 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequence analysis that was validated with different mock communities and benchmarked against <b>QIIME</b> as a frequently used pipeline."
5625,"The microbial composition of 49 independently amplified mock samples was characterized by sequencing two variable 16S rRNA gene regions, V4 and V5-V6, in three separate sequencing runs on Illumina\'s HiSeq2000 platform."
5626,"This allowed for the evaluation of important causes of technical bias in taxonomic classification: 1) run-to-run sequencing variation, 2) PCR-error, and 3) region/primer specific amplification bias."
5627,"Despite the short read length (~140 nt) and all technical biases, the average specificity of the taxonomic assignment for the phylotypes included in the mock communities was 97.78%."
5628,"On average 99.95% and 88.43% of the reads could be assigned to at least family or genus level, respectively, while assignment to \'spurious genera\' represented on average only 0.21% of the reads per sample."
5629,"Analysis of \xce\xb1- and \xce\xb2-diversity confirmed conclusions guided by biology rather than the aforementioned methodological aspects, which was not achieved with QIIME."
5630,<b>Conclusions:\xc2\xa0</b>Different biological outcomes are commonly observed due to 16S rRNA region-specific performance.
5631,"NG-Tax demonstrated high robustness against choice of region and other technical biases associated with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing studies, diminishing their impact and providing accurate qualitative and quantitative representation of the true sample composition."
5632,"This will improve comparability between studies and facilitate efforts towards standardization.Insights into the influence of redox conditions, that is the availability of electron acceptors, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) on pesticide biodegradation in groundwater are key to understanding the environmental fate of pesticides in natural groundwater systems."
5633,"Here, the influence of redox conditions and supplemental DOM addition on biodegradation of pesticides, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM), mecoprop-p (MCPP) and bentazone, was tested in microcosm and subsequent column experiments."
5634,"Pesticide degradation, functional genes and changes in specific fractions and quantity of DOM were systematically quantified."
5635,"In aerobic microcosm experiments, the highest 2,4-D degradation rate was obtained with the presence of more assimilable DOM."
5636,"In column experiments, minimal pesticide degradation (\xe2\x89\xa433.77%) in any anaerobic redox conditions was observed in the absence of DOM."
5637,"However, in the presence of DOM, 2,4-D biodegradation was considerably enhanced under nitrate-reducing conditions (from 23.5\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf10.2% to 82.3\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf11.6%) and in a column without external electron acceptor amendment (from -6.3\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf12.6% to 31.1\xe2\x80\xaf\xc2\xb1\xe2\x80\xaf36.3%)."
5638,Observed preferential depletion of the fulvic acid fraction of DOM provides indications for specific functional DOM properties.
5639,The qPCR results show an increase in microbial biomass and functional genes (tfdA) in liquid phase after DOM addition.
5640,"The results of this work provide insights into the interplays among DOM, redox geochemistry, and pesticide biodegradation, and show the potential of a novel approach - DOM addition to groundwater systems - for in situ biostimulation technology to remove pesticides from groundwater systems.Natural products represent a rich reservoir of small molecule drug candidates utilized as antimicrobial drugs, anticancer therapies, and immunomodulatory agents."
5641,These molecules are microbial secondary metabolites synthesized by co-localized genes termed Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs).
5642,"The increase in full microbial genomes and similar resources has led to development of BGC prediction algorithms, although their precision and ability to identify novel BGC classes could be improved."
5643,Here we present a deep learning strategy (DeepBGC) that offers reduced false positive rates in BGC identification and an improved ability to extrapolate and identify novel BGC classes compared to existing machine-learning tools.
5644,We supplemented this with random forest classifiers that accurately predicted BGC product classes and potential chemical activity.
5645,Application of DeepBGC to bacterial genomes uncovered previously undetectable putative BGCs that may code for natural products with novel biologic activities.
5646,The improved accuracy and classification ability of DeepBGC represents a major addition to in-silico BGC identification.In animal livestock heavy metals are widely used as feed additives to control enteric bacterial infections as well as to enhance the integrity of the immune system.
5647,"As these metals are only partially adsorbed by animals, the content of heavy metals in manure and wastewaters causes soil and ground water contamination, with Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> being the most critical output from pig livestock."
5648,Phytoremediation is considered a valid strategy to improve the purity of wastewaters.
5649,"This work studied the effect of Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> on the morphology and protein expression in Thelypteris palustris and Typha latifolia plants, cultured in a wetland pilot system."
5650,"Despite the absence of macroscopic alterations, remodeling of cell walls and changes in carbohydrate metabolism were observed in the rhizomes of both plants and in leaves of Thelypteris palustris."
5651,"However, similar modifications seemed to be determined by the alterations of different mechanisms in these plants."
5652,These data also suggested that marsh ferns are more sensitive to metals than monocots.
5653,"Whereas toleration mechanisms seemed to be activated in Typha latifolia, in Thelypteris palustris the observed modifications appeared as slight toxic effects due to metal exposure."
5654,"This study clearly indicates that both plants could be successfully employed in in situ phytoremediation systems, to remove Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup> at concentrations that are ten times higher than the legal limits, without affecting plant growth.N and P are the key limiting nutrients considered most important for the stimulation of crude oil degradation but other trace nutrients may also be important."
5655,Experimental soil microcosms were setup to investigate crude oil degradation in the context of Ni amendments.
5656,"Amended Nickel as NiO, NiCl<sub>2</sub>, or, a porphyrin complex either inhibited, had no effect, or, enhanced aerobic hydrocarbon degradation in an oil-contaminated soil."
5657,"Biodegradation was significantly (95% confidence) enhanced (70%) with low levels of Ni-Porph (12\xe2\x80\xafmg/kg) relative to an oil-only control; whereas, NiO (200 and 350\xe2\x80\xafmg/kg) significantly inhibited (36 and 87%) biodegradation consistent with oxide particle induced reactive oxygen stress."
5658,Microbial community compositions were also significantly affected by Ni.
5659,"In 16S rRNA sequence libraries, the enriched hydrocarbon degrading genus, Rhodococcus, was partially replaced by a Nocardia sp."
5660,in the presence of low levels of NiO (12 and 50\xe2\x80\xafmg/kg).
5661,"In contrast, the highest relative and absolute Rhodococcus abundances were coincident with the maximal rates of oil degradation observed in the Ni-Porph-amended soils."
5662,Growth dependent constitutive requirements for Ni-dependent urease or perhaps Ni-dependent superoxide dismutase enzymes (found in Rhodococcus genomes) provided a mechanistic explanation for stimulation.
5663,"These results suggest biostimulation technologies, in addition to N and P, should also consider trace nutrients such as Ni tacitly considered adequately supplied and available in a typical soil.Enhancing the biodegradation efficiency of atrazine, a kind of commonly applied herbicide, has been attracted much more concern."
5664,"Here, Zn<sup>2+</sup> which has long been considered essential in adjusting cell physiological status was selected to investigate its role on the biodegradation of atrazine by Arthrobacter sp."
5665,DNS10 as well as the transmembrane transport of atrazine during the biodegradation period.
5666,"The results of gas chromatography showed that the atrazine removal percentages (initial concentration was 100\xe2\x80\xafmg\xe2\x80\xafL<sup>-1</sup>) in 0.05\xe2\x80\xafmM Zn<sup>2+</sup> and 1.0\xe2\x80\xafmM Zn<sup>2+</sup> treatments were 94.42% and 86.02% respectively at 48\xe2\x80\xafh, while there was also 66.43% of atrazine left in the treatment without exogenous Zn<sup>2+</sup> existence."
5667,The expression of atrazine chlorohydrolase gene trzN in the strain DNS10 cultured with 0.05\xe2\x80\xafmM and 1.0\xe2\x80\xafmM Zn<sup>2+</sup> was 7.30- and 4.67- times respectively compared with that of the non-zinc treatment.
5668,"In addition, the flow cytometry test suggests that 0.05\xe2\x80\xafmM of Zn<sup>2+</sup> could better adjust the membrane permeability of strain DNS10, meanwhile, the amount of atrazine accumulation in the strain DNS10 co-cultured with this level Zn<sup>2+</sup> was 2.21 times of that of the strain without Zn<sup>2+</sup>."
5669,This study may facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that exogenous Zn<sup>2+</sup> enhances the biodegradation of atrazine by Arthrobacter sp.
5670,"DNS10.Lindane is an organochlorine pesticide that, due to its persistence in the environment, is still detected in different matrices."
5671,Bioremediation using actinobacteria consortia proved to be promising for the restoration of contaminated soils.
5672,"Another alternative to remove xenobiotics is to use agricultural residues, which stimulates microbial activity, increasing its capacity to degrade organic pollutants."
5673,The present work studies the coupling of sugarcane bagasse biostimulation and bioaugmentation with the actinobacteria consortium composed of Streptomyces sp.
5674,"A2, A5, A11 and M7 on lindane removal in different soil types."
5675,"In this sense, factorial designs with three factors (proportion and size of sugarcane bagasse particles, and moisture content) were employed."
5676,A response optimizer identified the combination of factors levels that jointly allowed obtaining the maximum lindane removal in the evaluated conditions.
5677,"In the optimal conditions, the effect of the bioremediation process on soil microbiota was studied by evaluating different parameters."
5678,"The highest lindane removal percentages were detected in biostimulated microcosms bioaugmented with the microbial consortium, which were accompanied by a decrease in lindane half-life respect to the controls."
5679,"Also, the bioaugmentation of biostimulated microcosms increased the microbial counts and enhanced soil enzymatic activities, corroborating the bioremediation process efficiency."
5680,The survival of the four actinobacteria at the end of the assay confirmed the ability of all Streptomyces strains to colonize amended soils.
5681,"Bioremediation by simultaneous application of biostimulation with sugarcane bagasse and bioaugmentation with the actinobacteria consortium, in the optimized conditions, represents an efficient strategy to restore lindane contaminated soils.The bacterial strain WD-2, which was capable of efficiently degrading prochloraz-manganese, was isolated from soil contaminated with prochloraz-manganese, selected through enrichment culturing and identified as Bacillus cereus."
5682,"Test results indicated that the optimal temperature and pH for bacterial growth were 35-40\xc2\xb0C and 7.0-8.0, respectively."
5683,The highest degradation rate was above 88-90% when the pH was 7.0~8.0 and reached a maximum value (90.7%) at approximately 8.0.
5684,"In addition, the bacterium showed the greatest growth ability with an OD600 of 0.805 and the highest degradation rate (68.2%) when glucose was chosen as the carbon source, while the difference in nitrogen source had no obvious influence on bacterial growth."
5685,The degradation rate exceeded 80% when the NaCl concentration was 0~2% and the rate reached 89.2% at 1%.
5686,"When the concentration was higher than 7%, the growth of WD-2 and the degradation of prochloraz-manganese were found to be inhibited, and the degradation rate was merely 8.5%."
5687,The results indicated that strain WD-2 was able to effectively degrade prochloraz-manganese and might contribute to the bioremediation of contaminated soils.Concerns regarding microplastic contamination have spread from aquatic environments to terrestrial systems with a growing number of studies have been reported.
5688,"Notwithstanding, the potential effects on soil ecosystems remain largely unexplored."
5689,"In this study, the effects of polyethylene microplastics on soil enzymatic activities and the bacterial community were evaluated, and the microbiota colonizing on microplastics were also investigated."
5690,"Microplastic amendment (2000 fragments per kg soil) significantly increased the urease and catalase activities in soil after 15 days, and no discernible alteration of invertase activities was detected."
5691,"Results from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that the alpha diversities (richness, evenness, and diversity) of the microbiota in soil were not obviously changed by the PE amendment, whereas the diversity indexes of microbiota on plastic fragments were significantly lower than those in the control and amended soils."
5692,Different taxonomic composition was observed in between the control and amended soils after 90 days of incubation.
5693,Bacterial assemblages with distinct community structure colonized the PE microplastics.
5694,"Additionally, several taxa including plastic-degrading bacteria and pathogens were more abundant on microplastics."
5695,"Simultaneously, the predicted functional profiles showed that the pathways of amino acid metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were higher on the microplastics."
5696,"These results indicated that microplastics in soil, compared with those in aquatic environments, can also act as a distinct microbial habitat, potentially altering the ecological functions of soil ecosystems.The continued increase in the global demand for oil, which reached 4,488 Mtoe in 2018, leads to large quantities of petroleum products entering the environment posing serious risks to natural ecosystems if left untreated."
5697,"In this study, we evaluated the impact of co-contamination with lead on the efficacy of two bioremediation processes, natural attenuation and biostimulation of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) as well as the associated toxicity and the changes in the microbial community in contaminated soils."
5698,"The biostimulated treatment resulted in 96% and 84% reduction in TPH concentration in a single and a co-contamination scenario, respectively, over 28 weeks of a mesocosm study."
5699,"This reduction was significantly more in comparison to natural attenuation in a single and a co-contamination scenario, which was 56% and 59% respectively."
5700,"In contrast, a significantly greater reduction in the associated toxicity of in soils undergoing natural attenuation was evident compared with soils undergoing biostimulation despite the lower TPH degradation when bioassays were applied."
5701,The earthworm toxicity test showed a decrease of 72% in the naturally attenuated toxicity versus only 62% in the biostimulated treatment of a single contamination scenario.
5702,"In a co-contamination scenario, toxicity decreased only 30% and 8% after natural attenuation and biostimulation treatments, respectively."
5703,16s rDNA sequence analysis was used to assess the impact of both the co-contamination and the bioremediation treatment.
5704,"NGS data revealed major bacterial domination by Nocardioides spp., which reached 40% in week 20 of the natural attenuation treatment."
5705,"In the biostimulated soil samples, more than 50% of the bacterial community was dominated by Alcanivorax spp."
5706,in week 12.
5707,The presence of Pb in the natural attenuation treatment resulted in an increased abundance of a few Pb-resistant genera such as Sphingopyxis spp.
5708,and Thermomonas spp in addition to Nocardioides spp.
5709,"In contrast, Pb co-contamination completely shifted the bacterial pattern in the stimulated treatment with Pseudomonas spp."
5710,comprising approximately 45% of the bacterial profile in week 12.
5711,This study confirms the effectiveness of biostimulation over natural attenuation in remediating TPH and TPH-Pb contaminated soils.
5712,"In addition, the presence of co-contaminants (e.g."
5713,"Pb) results in serious impacts on the efficacy of bioremediation of TPH in contaminated soils, which must be considered prior to designing any bioremediation strategy.The accumulation of high amounts of petroleum-derived plastics in the environment has raised ecological and health concerns."
5714,"The aim of this work was to study the biodegradative abilities of five bacterial strains, namely Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pseudomonas citronellolis, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus flexus and Chelatococcus daeguensis, towards polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride films under aerobic conditions."
5715,Preliminary screening resulted in the selection of P. citronellolis and B. flexus as potential PVC film degraders.
5716,Both strains were able to form a biofilm on the plastic film surface and to cause some modifications to the FTIR spectra of biomass-free PVC films.
5717,The two strains were then used to set up a PVC film biodegradation assay in 2-liter flasks.
5718,"After 45 days incubation, fragmentation of the film was observed, suggesting that PVC biodegradative activity took place."
5719,"Gel permeation chromatography analysis showed a reduction in average molecular weight of 10% for PVC incubated with P. citronellolis, with PVC polymer chains apparently attacked."
5720,"Based on these results, the P. citronellolis strain was selected for biodegradation assays of two waste PVC films, used either nonsterile or subjected to ethanol sterilization."
5721,Chemical analyses on the incubated films confirmed the biodegradation of waste PVC plastics as shown by a gravimetric weight loss of up to about 19% after 30 days incubation.
5722,"In summary, this work reports the biodegradation of PVC films by P. citronellolis and B. flexus."
5723,"Both strains were shown to act mainly against PVC additives, exhibiting a low biodegradation rate of PVC polymer.Organophosphorus compounds (OPs) are neurotoxic molecules developed as insecticides and chemical warfare nerve agents (CWNAs)."
5724,"They are covalent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a key enzyme in central and peripheral nervous systems and are responsible for numerous poisonings worldwide."
5725,Many animal models have been studied over the years but finding a suitable in vivo model to account for both acute toxicity and long-term exposure remains a topical issue.
5726,"Recently, an emerging aquatic animal model harboring a mammalian-like cholinergic nervous system, the freshwater planarian from Platyhelminthes, has been used to investigate neurotoxicity and developmental disruption."
5727,"Given the tremendous toxicity of OPs, various bioremediation strategies have been considered over the years to counter their poisonous effects."
5728,"Among these, enzymes have been particularly highlighted as they can degrade OPs in a fast, non toxic and environmentally friendly manner."
5729,"In this article we investigated the biotechnological potential for decontaminating OPs of the previously reported variant SsoPox-\xce\xb1sD6 from the hyperstable enzyme SsoPox, isolated from the archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus."
5730,"The capacity to hydrolyze 4 new substrates (methyl-pirimiphos, quinalphos, triazophos and dibrom) was demonstrated and the degradation products generated by enzymatic hydrolysis were characterized."
5731,We further evaluated the capacity of SsoPox-\xce\xb1sD6 for in vivo protection of freshwater planarians Schmidtea mediterranea (Smed).
5732,The use of SsoPox-\xce\xb1sD6 drastically decreased mortality and enhanced mobility of planarians.
5733,"Then, an enzyme-based filtration device was developed by immobilizing intact Escherichia coli cells expressing SsoPox-\xce\xb1sD6 into alginate beads."
5734,The efficacy of the device was demonstrated using planarians as biosensors.The anaerobic degradation of petroleum is an important process in natural environments.
5735,"So far, few studies have considered the response of the microbial community to nanomaterials during this process."
5736,This study explored the potential effects of graphene oxide and biochar on the anaerobic degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in long-term experiments.
5737,Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that the addition of carbon-based materials promoted the electrochemical activity of anaerobic cultures that degrade petroleum hydrocarbons.
5738,"The maximum degradation rates for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEXs) in the cultures incubated for 10 weeks with graphene oxide (0.02\xc2\xa0mg/L) and biochar (20\xc2\xa0mg/L) were 76.5% and 77.6%, respectively."
5739,"The maximum degradation rates of n-alkanes in the cultures incubated for 10 weeks with graphene oxide (2\xc2\xa0mg/L) and biochar (100\xc2\xa0mg/L) were 70.0% and 77.8%, respectively."
5740,The 16S rDNA copy numbers in the treatments with 0.02\xc2\xa0mg/L graphene oxide and 20\xc2\xa0mg/L biochar were significantly higher than others during the process (P < 0.05).
5741,"In the 2nd week, the maximum copy numbers of the masD and bamA genes in the treatments with biochar were 349 copies/mL (20\xc2\xa0mg/L) and 422 copies/mL (20\xc2\xa0mg/L), respectively, and in the treatments with graphene oxide were 289 copies/mL (0\xc2\xa0mg/L) and 366 copies/mL (0.02\xc2\xa0mg/L)."
5742,"The contents of carbon-based materials had slight effects on the microbial community structure, whereas the culture time had obvious effects."
5743,"Paracoccus denitrificans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Hydrogenophaga caeni were the dominant microorganisms in the culture systems under all treatments.The bioremediation potential of an aquifer contaminated with tetrachloroethene (PCE) was assessed by combining hydrogeochemical data of the site, microcosm studies, metabolites concentrations, compound specific-stable carbon isotope analysis and the identification of selected reductive dechlorination biomarker genes."
5744,The characterization of the site through 10 monitoring wells evidenced that leaked PCE was transformed to TCE and cis-DCE via hydrogenolysis.
5745,Carbon isotopic mass balance of chlorinated ethenes pointed to two distinct sources of contamination and discarded relevant alternate degradation pathways in the aquifer.
5746,Application of specific-genus primers targeting Dehalococcoides mccartyi species and the vinyl chloride-to-ethene reductive dehalogenase vcrA indicated the presence of autochthonous bacteria capable of the complete dechlorination of PCE.
5747,"The observed cis-DCE stall was consistent with the aquifer geochemistry (positive redox potentials; presence of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and sulphate; absence of ferrous iron), which was thermodynamically favourable to dechlorinate highly chlorinated ethenes but required lower redox potentials to evolve beyond cis-DCE to the innocuous end product ethene."
5748,"Accordingly, the addition of lactate or a mixture of ethanol plus methanol as electron donor sources in parallel field-derived anoxic microcosms accelerated dechlorination of PCE and passed cis-DCE up to ethene, unlike the controls (without amendments, representative of field natural attenuation)."
5749,Lactate fermentation produced acetate at near-stoichiometric amounts.
5750,The array of techniques used in this study provided complementary lines of evidence to suggest that enhanced anaerobic bioremediation using lactate as electron donor source is a feasible strategy to successfully decontaminate this site.Much fundamental research has already been performed to understand the mechanism of microbial rubber degradation.
5751,"Due to the increasing amount of rubber waste, biotechnical methods to degrade that particular waste are strongly needed."
5752,"The present study evaluates whether a microbial or an enzymatic process is more suitable for efficient biodegradation, due to less sensitivity towards rubber additives."
5753,Therefore we investigated the impact of 15 different frequently used rubber additives on cells of the potent rubber degrader Gordonia polyisoprenivorans VH2 and the enzyme Lcp1<sub>VH2</sub>.
5754,"For this, cells were grown on poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) in presence of these rubber additives."
5755,"Furthermore, the effect of those additives on the enzymatic cleavage of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) by Lcp1<sub>VH2</sub> was determined by in vitro studies."
5756,"It was observed that additives, used to accelerate the vulcanization process, like N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide and zinc-bis(N,N-dibenzyl-dithiocarbamate), are diminishing the growth of the microorganism depending on their concentration-higher toxicity with increasing concentration."
5757,"In contrast, sulfur prevents cell growth, but does not affect Lcp1<sub>VH2</sub>."
5758,Stearic acid and paraffin wax were found to be consumed by G. polyisoprenivorans VH2.
5759,"Plasticizers mainly prevent growth, but do not interfere with the enzyme activity."
5760,This study identified antioxidants as the most interfering group of additives for microbial and enzymatic rubber degradation.
5761,"It was found that the in vitro degradation by Lcp1<sub>VH2</sub> is much more resistant and less sensitive towards the investigated rubber additives, when compared to the in vivo approach."
5762,"Therefore, an enzymatic process might be a promising method to enhance rubber degradation.Biodegradation of 1,4-dioxane was examined in packed quartz and soil column flow-through systems."
5763,"The inhibitory effects of co-contaminants, specifically trichloroethene (TCE), 1,1-dichloroethene (1,1-DCE), and copper (Cu<sup>2+</sup>) ions, were investigated in the columns either with or without bioaugmentation with a 1,4-dioxane degrading bacterium Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190."
5764,"Results indicate that CB1190\xe2\x80\xafcells readily grew and colonized in the columns, leading to significant degradation of 1,4-dioxane under oxic conditions."
5765,"Degradation of 1,4-dioxane was also observed in the native soil (without bioaugmentation), which had been previously subjected to enhanced reductive dechlorination treatment for co-contaminants TCE and 1,1-DCE."
5766,"Bioaugmentation of the soil with CB1190 resulted in nearly complete degradation at influent concentrations of 3-10\xc2\xa0mg\xe2\x80\xafL<sup>-1</sup> 1,4-dioxane and a residence reaction time of 40-80\xe2\x80\xafh, but the presence of co-contaminants, 1,1-DCE and Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions (up to 10\xc2\xa0mg\xe2\x80\xafL<sup>-1</sup>), partially inhibited 1,4-dioxane degradation in the untreated and bioaugmented soil columns."
5767,"However, the inhibitory effects were much less severe in the column flow-through systems than those previously observed in planktonic cultures, which showed near complete inhibition at the same co-contaminant concentrations."
5768,"These observations demonstrate a low susceptibility of soil microbes to the toxicity of 1,1-DCE and Cu<sup>2+</sup> in packed soil flow-through systems, and thus have important implications for predicting biodegradation potential and developing sustainable, cost-effective technologies for in situ remediation of 1,4-dioxane contaminated soils and groundwater.Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is an antibiotic that is widely used to treat bacterial infections and is poorly biodegraded during wastewater treatment."
5769,"In this study, a CIP-degrading bacterial strain (GLC_01) was successfully retrieved from activated sludge by enrichment and isolation."
5770,The obtained bacterial strain shares over 99% nucleotide identity of the 16S rRNA gene with Bradyrhizobium spp.
5771,Results show that Bradyrhizobium sp.
5772,GLC_01 degraded CIP via cometabolism with another carbon substrate following a first-order kinetics degradation reaction.
5773,CIP degradation by Bradyrhizobium sp.
5774,GLC_01 increased when the concentration of the primary carbon source increased.
5775,The biodegradability of the primary carbon source also affected CIP degradation.
5776,The use of glucose and sodium acetate (i.e.
5777,"readily biodegradable), respectively, as a primary carbon source enhanced CIP biotransformation, compared to starch (i.e."
5778,relatively slowly biodegradable).
5779,CIP degradation decreased with the increase of the initial CIP concentration.
5780,Over 70% CIP biotransformation was achieved at 0.05\xe2\x80\xafmg\xe2\x80\xafL<sup>-1</sup> whereas CIP degradation decreased to 26% at 10\xe2\x80\xafmg\xe2\x80\xafL<sup>-1</sup>.
5781,"The phylogenetic identification and experimental verification of this CIP-degrading bacterium can lead to a bioengineering approach to manage antibiotics and possibly other persistent organic contaminants during wastewater treatment.Chlorinated benzenes are common groundwater contaminants in the United States, so demonstrating whether they undergo degradation in the subsurface is important in determining the best remedy for this contamination."
5782,The purpose of this work was to use a new data mining approach to investigate chlorinated benzene degradation pathways in the subsurface.
5783,Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was used to analyze long-term measurements of chlorinated benzene concentrations in groundwater at a contaminated site in New Jersey.
5784,A dataset containing 597 groundwater samples and 5 chlorinated benzenes and benzene collected from 144 wells over 20 years was investigated using PMF2 software.
5785,"Despite the heterogeneity of this dataset, PMF analysis revealed patterns indicative of microbial dechlorination in the groundwater and provided insight about where dechlorination is occurring, to what extent, and under which geochemical conditions."
5786,"PMF resolved a factor indicative of a source of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene and two factors representing stages of dechlorination, one more advanced than the other."
5787,"The PMF results indicated that virtually all of the 1,2-dichlorobenzene at the site arises from its use onsite, not from the dechlorination of trichlorobenzenes."
5788,Factors were further interpreted using ancillary data such as geochemical indicators and field parameters also measured in the samples.
5789,Analysis suggested that the partial and advanced dechlorination signals occur under different subsurface physical conditions.
5790,The results provided field validation of the current understanding of anaerobic dechlorination of chlorinated benzenes in the subsurface developed from laboratory studies.
5791,"PMF is thereby shown to be a useful tool for investigating chlorinated benzene dechlorination.Although the use of Sulfluramid (N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamide (N-EtFOSA)) has been restricted by the Stockholm Convention, it is still frequently detected in the environmental matrices and in use in some countries."
5792,Employing constructed wetlands as treatment systems requires understanding of the biodegradation process in the rhizosphere and the effect of contaminants on the microbes of wetlands.
5793,This study aimed to investigate the interactions between the microbial community and N-EtFOSA under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
5794,Aerobic biotransformation of N-EtFOSA occurred with a half-life of 0.51 day and yielded 85.1\xe2\x80\xafmol% PFOS of after 91 days.
5795,Kinetic modelling revealed that cleavage of the SN was the rate-limiting degradation step.
5796,"Biotransformation was not observed under anaerobic and anoxic conditions, suggesting that N-EtFOSA is recalcitrant to biodegradation without dissolved oxygen."
5797,"Under aerobic condition, the presence of N-EtFOSA and its biotransformation products decreased the microbial richness and diversity and exerted selective pressure on the microbial community."
5798,"Enrichment of Methylocaldum was significant (49%) in the presence of N-EtFOSA compared to unexposed conditions (11%), suggesting that Methylocaldum is relatively tolerant to N-EtFOSA and potentially degrading N-EtFOSA."
5799,"Under anaerobic conditions, the microbial richness and diversity were not significantly altered by the presence of N-EtFOSA."
5800,Only Methanomethylovorans increased significantly in the spiked microcosm (30% vs. 20%).
5801,"These findings provide knowledge for comprehending the contribution of N-EtFOSA to other PFASs in various environmental conditions, information about microbial community changes in response to PFASs and robust microbial species which can degrade N-EtFOSA in the environment.Methamphetamine (METH) and ketamine (KET) are widely detected in surface waters and thus may pose threat to aquatic organisms."
5802,"However, their degradation in aquatic systems and the effects on bacterial community were unknown."
5803,The present study investigated the biodegradation process of METH and KET in river waters and sediments.
5804,"Three microcosms were examined over 40-days\' incubation under (i) aerobic and illumination conditions, (ii) anaerobic condition exposed to light, (iii) anaerobic-dark condition."
5805,Statistically significant biodegradation of METH and KET (1\xe2\x80\xafmg\xe2\x80\xafL<sup>-1</sup>) was observed in all treatments.
5806,The half-lives under the examined conditions indicate that the two drugs were refractory in aquatic environment.
5807,"Moreover, there were no pronounced absorption and photolysis observed in this work."
5808,"Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis revealed that Methylophilaceae, Saprospiraceae, WCHB1-69, Desulfobulbaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, FamilyXI, Peptococcaceae, and Rhizobiaceae were the predominant candidatus families during KET and METH biodegradation, and the preponderance would impair other microorganisms\' prosperity since them were scarcely detected in the wild."
5809,"Meanwhile, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) indicates that METH as an environmental factor may affect bacterial community structure in field water samples.Iron oxides are reactive inorganic soil components that play an important role in the fate and transport of organic pollutants."
5810,"Here, hematite was selected to investigate its effect on the biodegradation of benzopyrene (BaP) by Paracoccus sp."
5811,strain HPD-2.
5812,"Approximately 60% of the total BaP was degraded in the absence of hematite after 7 days but only 30.8 and 20.8% of that was degraded after the addition of 10 and 20\xe2\x80\xafmg \xe2\x80\xafmL<sup>-1</sup> hematite, respectively, indicating that the addition of hematite could significantly inhibit the biodegradation of BaP (P\xe2\x80\xaf<\xe2\x80\xaf0.05)."
5813,The hematite also lowered bacterium activity by coating the cells and by generating reactive oxygen species that destroyed the cells.
5814,"Two-photon confocal laser scanning microscope images showed that the addition of hematite substantially decreased the amount of BaP combined with the bacterium, and this also enabled us to observe directly the migration and regression of BaP in the interaction between HPD-2 and hematite."
5815,Higher death ratio of HPD-2 might lower the BaP access to live cells because dead cells have a higher adsorption affinity for BaP than live cells.
5816,"These observations enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which metal oxides, organic pollutants and degrading-bacteria interact during the biodegradation process.Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) belong to a diverse group of environmental pollutants distributed ubiquitously in the environment."
5817,The carcinogenic properties of PAHs are the main causes of harm to human health.
5818,"The green technology, biodegradation have become convenient options to address the environmental pollution."
5819,"In this study, we analyzed the biodegradation potential of naphthalene with secondary carbon supplements (SCSs) in carbon deficient media (CSM) by Pseudomonas putida strain KD9 isolated from oil refinerary waste."
5820,"The rigid-flexible molecular docking method revealed that the mutated naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase had lower affinity for naphthalene than that found in wild type strain."
5821,"Moreover, analytical methods (HPLC, qRT-PCR) and soft agar chemotaxis suggest sucrose (0.5\xe2\x80\xafwt%) to be the best chemo-attractant and it unequivocally caused enhanced biodegradation of naphthalene (500\xe2\x80\xafmg\xe2\x80\xafL<sup>-1</sup>) in both biofilm-mediated and shake-flask biodegradation methods."
5822,"In addition, the morphological analysis detected from microscopy clearly showed KD9 to change its size and shape (rod to pointed) during biodegradation of naphthalene in CSM as sole source of carbon and energy."
5823,The forward versus side light scatter plot of the singlet cells obtained from flow cytometry suggests smaller cell size in CSM and lower florescence intensity of the total DNA content of cells.
5824,"This study concludes that sucrose may be used as potential bio-stimulation agent.Rhodococcus aetherivorans JCM 14343 can degrade 1,4-dioxane as a sole carbon and energy source."
5825,"This study aimed to characterize this 1,4-dioxane degradation ability further, and assess the potential use of the strain for 1,4-dioxane removal in industrial wastewater."
5826,"Strain JCM 14343 was able to degrade 1,4-dioxane inducibly, and its 1,4-dioxane degradation was also induced by tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-butanediol."
5827,"The demonstration that 1,4-butanediol not only induced but also enhanced 1,4-dioxane degradation was a novel finding of this study."
5828,"Although strain JCM 14343 appeared not to be an effective 1,4-dioxane degrader considering the maximum specific 1,4-dioxane degradation rate (0.0073\xc2\xa0mg-dioxane/mg-protein/h), half saturation concentration (59.2\xc2\xa0mg/L), and cell yield (0.031\xc2\xa0mg-protein/mg-1,4-dioxane), the strain could degrade over 1100\xc2\xa0mg/L of 1,4-dioxane and maintain its degradation activity at a wide range of temperature (5-40\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) and pH (4-9) conditions."
5829,"This suggests the usefulness of strain JCM 14343 in 1,4-dioxane treatment under acidic and cold conditions."
5830,"In addition, 1,4-dioxane degradation experiments in the presence of ethylene glycol (EG) or other cyclic ethers revealed that 1,4-dioxane degradation by strain JCM 14343 was inhibited in the presence of other cyclic ethers, but not by EG, suggesting certain applicability of strain JCM 14343 for industrial wastewater treatment.The increasing usage of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) in oilfields as a flooding agent to enhance oil recovery at so large quantities is an ecological hazard to the subsurface ecosystem due to persistence and inertness."
5831,Biodegradation of HPAM is a potentially promising strategy for dealing with this problem among many other methods available.
5832,"To understand the responsible microorganisms and mechanism of HPAM biodegradation under anaerobic conditions, an enrichment culture from production waters of oil reservoirs were established with HPAM as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen incubated for over 328\xc2\xa0days, and analyzed using both molecular microbiology and chemical characterization methods."
5833,"Gel permeation chromatography, High-pressure liquid chromatography and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy results indicated that, after 328\xc2\xa0days of anaerobic incubation, some of the amide groups on HPAM were removed and released as ammonia/ammonium and carboxylic groups, while the carbon backbone of HPAM was converted to smaller polymeric fragments, including oligomers and various fatty acids."
5834,"Based on these results, the biochemical process of anaerobic biodegradation of HPAM was proposed."
5835,"The phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from the enrichments showed that Proteobacteria and Planctomycetes were the dominant bacteria in the culture with HPAM as the source of carbon and nitrogen, respectively."
5836,"For archaea, Methanofollis was more abundant in the anaerobic enrichment."
5837,"These results are helpful for understanding the process of HPAM biodegradation and provide significant insights to the fate of HPAM in subsurface environment and for possible bioremediation.Bioelectroremediation is an efficient, sustainable, and environment-friendly remediation technology for the complexly contaminated sediments."
5838,"Although various recalcitrant pollutants could be degraded in the electrode district, the degradation efficiency was generally confined by the low total organic carbon (TOC) content in the sediment."
5839,How to enhance the electroactive degraders\' activity and efficiency remain poorly understood.
5840,Here we investigated the bioeletroremediation of a complexly contaminated river sediment with low TOC in a cylindric sediment microbial fuel cell stimulated by methanol.
5841,"After 200 days treatment, the degradation efficiencies of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and cycloalkenes (CYE) in the electrode district with methanol stimulation were 1.45-4.38 times higher compared with those in the non-electrode district without methanol stimulation."
5842,"The overall electrode district communities were significantly positively correlated with the variables of the enhanced TPH, PAH, CYE and TOC degradation efficiencies (p\xe2\x80\xaf<\xe2\x80\xaf.01)."
5843,"The joint electrical and exogenous methanol stimulation selectively enriched electroactive degraders (Geobacter and Desulfobulbus) in the anode biofilms, and their proportion was markedly positively correlated with the characteristic and total pollutants degradation efficiencies (p\xe2\x80\xaf<\xe2\x80\xaf.001)."
5844,"This study offers a new insight into the response of key electroactive degraders to the joint stimulation process.Microorganism with simultaneous nitrification and denitrification ability plays a significant role in nitrogen removal process, especially in the eutrophic waters with excessive nitrogen loads."
5845,The nitrogen removal capacity of microorganism may suffer from low temperature or nitrite nitrogen source.
5846,"In this study, a hypothermia aerobic nitrite-denitrifying bacterium, Pseudomonas tolaasii strain Y-11, was selected to determine the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification ability with mixed nitrogen source at 15\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C."
5847,The sole nitrogen removal efficiencies of strain Y-11 in simulated wastewater were obtained.
5848,"After 24\xc2\xa0h of incubation at 15\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C, the ammonium nitrogen fell below the detection limit from an initial value of 10.99\xc2\xa0mg/L."
5849,Approximately 88.0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb1\xc2\xa00.33% of nitrate nitrogen was removed with the initial concentration of 11.78\xc2\xa0mg/L and the nitrite nitrogen was not detected with the initial concentration of 10.75\xc2\xa0mg/L after 48\xc2\xa0h of incubation at 15\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C.
5850,"Additionally, the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification nitrogen removal ability of P. tolaasii strain Y-11 was evaluated using low concentration of mixed NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N/NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>-N (about 5\xc2\xa0mg/L-N each) and high concentration of mixed NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>-N/NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>-N (about 100\xc2\xa0mg/L-N each)."
5851,There was no nitrite nitrogen accumulation at the time of evaluation.
5852,"The results demonstrated that P. tolaasii strain Y-11 had higher simultaneous nitrification and denitrification capacity with low concentration of mixed inorganic nitrogen sources and may be applied in low temperature wastewater treatment.1,4-Dioxane (dioxane), a probable human carcinogen, often exists in industrial wastewater and domestic sewage."
5853,"In this study, we applied 16S rRNA and metatranscriptomic methods to analyze the dioxane biodegradation mechanism by activated sludge."
5854,Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was added as an essential co-metabolite to promote the degradation of dioxane.
5855,We found the dioxane removal ratio increased with increasing THF concentrations.
5856,"When the THF concentration increased from 60.0 to 200.0 mg/L, the dioxane degradation rate was stable."
5857,Three additions of \xe2\x88\xbc60.0 mg/L THF resulted in better dioxane degradation than one addition of 200 mg/L THF.
5858,Ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria with methane monooxygenases (MOs) and ammonia MOs played the most important roles during the degradation of dioxane.
5859,Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes metabolic pathway and functional genes analyses showed that the activated sludge system was complex and stable when dioxane was added.
5860,"In future studies, primers should be designed to identify specific bacteria and functional MO genes, which would help reveal the function of various bacteria and their MOs during dioxane degradation.The discharge of dye-contaminated wastewater into natural waterways presents a substantial risk to human and environmental health, therefore necessitating the treatment and removal of toxic dyes from colored wastewaters before their release into the ecosystem."
5861,The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize bacterial strains capable of decolorizing and/or degrading azo dyes commonly applied in textile production (monoazo dye Reactive Orange 16 and diazo dye Reactive Green 19) from activated sludge systems used in the treatment of (textile) wastewater.
5862,Following a prescreening of 125 isolates for their decolorization potential five strains were retained for further evaluation of decolorization rate and effects of physicochemical parameters using a microtiter plate method.
5863,"Of those five strains, one strain belonging to the genus Acinetobacter (ST16.16/164) and another belonging to Klebsiella (ST16.16/034) outperformed the other tested strains."
5864,Both strains exhibited strong decolorization ability (>80%) within a wide temperature range (20\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C-40\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C) and retained good decolorization activity at temperatures as low as 10\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C (especially strain ST16.16/034).
5865,"Among the different pH values tested (pH 4, 7 and 10), highest dye removal for both strains occurred at pH 7, with decolorization efficiency remaining relatively high under alkaline conditions (pH 10), and neither isolates decolorization efficiency was negatively impacted by high salt or high dye concentration."
5866,"Furthermore, both strains displayed the highest rate of decolorization and were able to completely (ST16.16/034) or partly (ST16.16/164) degrade the azo dyes."
5867,"Altogether, our results support the use of these bacteria in the treatment of industrial wastewaters containing azo dyes.We report a cluster of genes encoding two monooxygenases (SadA and SadB) and one FMN reductase (SadC) that enable Microbacterium sp."
5868,strain BR1 and other Actinomycetes to inactivate sulfonamide antibiotics.
5869,Our results show that SadA and SadC are responsible for the initial attack of sulfonamide molecules resulting in the release of 4-aminophenol.
5870,"The latter is further transformed into 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene by SadB and SadC prior to mineralization and concomitant production of biomass."
5871,"As the degradation products lack antibiotic activity, the presence of SadA will result in an alleviated bacteriostatic effect of sulfonamides."
5872,In addition to the relief from antibiotic stress this bacterium gains access to an additional carbon source when this gene cluster is expressed.
5873,As degradation of sulfonamides was also observed when Microbacterium sp.
5874,"strain BR1 was grown on artificial urine medium, colonization with such strains may impede common sulfonamide treatment during co-infections with pathogens of the urinary tract."
5875,"This case of biodegradation exemplifies the evolving catabolic capacity of bacteria, given that sulfonamide bacteriostatic are purely of synthetic origin."
5876,The wide distribution of this cluster in Actinomycetes and the presence of traA encoding a relaxase in its vicinity suggest that this cluster is mobile and that is rather alarming.A mesocosm case study was conducted to gain understanding and practical knowledge on biofilm emerging contaminants biodegradation capacity under stressor and multiple stressor conditions.
5877,"Two real life scenarios: I) biodegradation in a pristine intermittent stream experiencing acute pollution and II) biodegradation in a chronically polluted intermittent stream, were examined via a multifactorial experiment using an artificial stream facility."
5878,Stream biofilms were exposed to different water flow conditions i.e.
5879,permanent and intermittent water flow.
5880,"Venlafaxine, a readily biodegradable pharmaceutical was used as a measure of biodegradation capacity while pollution was simulated by a mixture of four emerging contaminants (erythromycin, sulfisoxazole, diclofenac and imidacloprid in addition to venlafaxine) in environmentally relevant concentrations."
5881,"Biodegradation kinetics monitored via LC-MS/MS was established, statistically evaluated, and used to link biodegradation with stress events."
5882,The results suggest that the effects of intermittent flow do not hinder and may even stimulate pristine biofilm biodegradation capacity.
5883,Chronic pollution completely reduced biodegradation in permanent water flow experimental treatments while no change in intermittent streams was observed.
5884,A combined effect of water flow conditions and emerging contaminants exposure on biodegradation was found.
5885,"The decrease in biodegradation due to exposure to emerging contaminants is significantly greater in streams with permanent water flow suggesting that the short and medium term biodegradation capacity in intermittent systems may be preserved or even greater than in perennial streams.Pesticides leaching from soil to surface and groundwater are a global threat for drinking water safety, as no cleaning methods occur for groundwater environment."
5886,"We examined whether peat, compost-peat-sand (CPS) mixture, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> with sodium citrate (Na-citrate), and the surfactant methyl-\xce\xb2-cyclodextrin additions enhance atrazine, simazine, hexazinone, dichlobenil, and the degradate 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) dissipations in sediment slurries under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, with sterilized controls."
5887,The vadose zone sediment cores were drilled from a depth of 11.3-14.6m in an herbicide-contaminated groundwater area.
5888,"The peat and CPS enhanced chemical atrazine and simazine dissipation, and the peat enhanced chemical hexazinone dissipation, all oxygen-independently."
5889,"Dichlobenil dissipated under all conditions, while BAM dissipation was fairly slow and half-lives could not be calculated."
5890,"The chemical dissipation rates could be associated with the chemical structures and properties of the herbicides, and additive compositions, not with pH."
5891,Microbial atrazine degradation was only observed in the Pseudomonas sp.
5892,"ADP amended slurries, although the sediment slurries were known to contain atrazine-degrading microorganisms."
5893,"The bioavailability of atrazine in the water phase seemed to be limited, which could be due to complex formation with organic and inorganic colloids."
5894,"Atrazine degradation by indigenous microbes could not be stimulated by the surfactant methyl-\xce\xb2-cyclodextrin, or by the additives NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> and NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> with Na-citrate, although the nitrogen additives increased microbial growth.Two biphenyl-degrading bacterial strains, SS1 and SS2, were isolated from polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated soil."
5895,"They were identified as Rhodococcus ruber and Rhodococcus pyridinivorans based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, as well as morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics."
5896,SS1 and SS2 exhibited tolerance to 2000 and 3000\xc2\xa0mg/L of biphenyl.
5897,"And they could degrade 83.2 and 71.5% of 1300\xc2\xa0mg/L biphenyl within 84\xc2\xa0h, respectively."
5898,"In the case of low-chlorinated PCB congeners, benzoate and 3-chlorobenzoate, the degradation activities of SS1 and SS2 were also significant."
5899,"In addition, these two strains exhibited chemotactic response toward TCA-cycle intermediates, benzoate, biphenyl and 2-chlorobenzoate."
5900,"This study indicated that, like the flagellated bacteria, non-flagellated Rhodococcus spp."
5901,might actively seek substrates through the process of chemotaxis once the substrates are depleted in their surroundings.
5902,"Together, these data provide supporting evidence that SS1 and SS2 might be good candidates for restoring biphenyl/PCB-polluted environments.Expression of the bacterial nitroreductase gene, nfsI, in tobacco plastids conferred the ability to detoxify TNT."
5903,"The toxic pollutant 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) is recalcitrant to degradation in the environment."
5904,"Phytoremediation is a potentially low cost remediation technique that could be applied to soil contaminated with TNT; however, progress is hindered by the phytotoxicity of this compound."
5905,"Previous studies have demonstrated that plants transformed with the bacterial nitroreductase gene, nfsI have increased ability to tolerate and detoxify TNT."
5906,"It has been proposed that plants engineered to express nfsI could be used to remediate TNT on military ranges, but this could require steps to mitigate transgene flow to wild populations."
5907,"To address this, we have developed nfsI transplastomic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) to reduce pollen-borne transgene flow."
5908,"Here we have shown that when grown on solid or liquid media, the transplastomic tobacco expressing nfsI were significantly more tolerant to TNT, produced increased biomass and removed more TNT from the media than untransformed plants."
5909,"Additionally, transplastomic plants expressing nfsI regenerated with high efficiency when grown on medium containing TNT, suggesting that nfsI and TNT could together be used to provide a selectable screen for plastid transformation.Lignolytic fungi initiate lignocellulose decay by producing extracellular oxidative enzymes."
5910,"For better understanding the enzymatic degradation of lignocellulose by white-rot fungi, we investigated the effect of manganese on the organic matter loss, manganese peroxidase (MnP) activity, and manganese peroxidase gene (mnp) transcription levels during solid-state fermentation of rice straw with Phanerochaete chrysosporium."
5911,"The results showed that the addition of manganese improved MnP activity and made it reach the peak earlier, promoted fungal growth at the early period (0-9\xc2\xa0days), and enhanced the degradation of lignocellulosic waste."
5912,"The total organic matter loss had a good correlation with fungal biomass during 30\xc2\xa0days of cultivation, and manganese amendment promoted the ability of P. chrysosporium to degrade lignocellulose."
5913,"Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed the differential expression of mnp1, mnp2, and mnp3: manganese amendment increased the transcription of mnp1 and mnp2 but not mnp3."
5914,The results indicated that manganese stimulated mnp transcription levels and played a post-transcriptional role in MnP production.
5915,"These findings provide opportunity of development in enzymatic degradation of lignocellulosic waste by P. chrysosporium amended with manganese.Wastewaters generated during mining and processing of metal sulfide ores are often acidic (pH\xc2\xa0<\xc2\xa03) and can contain significant concentrations of nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium from nitrogen based explosives."
5916,"In addition, wastewaters from sulfide ore treatment plants and tailings ponds typically contain large amounts of inorganic sulfur compounds, such as thiosulfate and tetrathionate."
5917,Release of these wastewaters can lead to environmental acidification as well as an increase in nutrients (eutrophication) and compounds that are potentially toxic to humans and animals.
5918,"Waters from cyanidation plants for gold extraction will often conjointly include toxic, sulfur containing thiocyanate."
5919,"More stringent regulatory limits on the release of mining wastes containing compounds such as inorganic sulfur compounds, nitrate, and thiocyanate, along the need to increase production from sulfide mineral mining calls for low cost techniques to remove these pollutants under ambient temperatures (approximately 8\xc2\xa0\xc2\xb0C)."
5920,"In this study, we used both aerobic and anaerobic continuous cultures to successfully couple inorganic sulfur compound (i.e."
5921,thiosulfate and thiocyanate) oxidation for the removal of nitrogenous compounds under neutral to acidic pH at the low temperatures typical for boreal climates.
5922,"Furthermore, the development of the respective microbial communities was identified over time by DNA sequencing, and found to contain a consortium including populations aligning within Flavobacterium, Thiobacillus, and Comamonadaceae lineages."
5923,"This is the first study to remediate mining waste waters by coupling autotrophic thiocyanate oxidation to nitrate reduction at low temperatures and acidic pH by means of an identified microbial community.In the present study the feasibility of the use of a bacterial batch sequential anaerobic-aerobic process, in which activated sludge was used in both parts of the process, for pretreatment of wastewater generated by a textile dyeing factory has been considered."
5924,Activated sludge used in the process was obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and adapted to real dyeing wastewater using either an anaerobic-only or an anaerobic-aerobic process over a period of 90 days.
5925,The use of activated sludge adapted using the anaerobic-aerobic process resulted in a higher overall decolorization efficiency compared to that achieved with activated sludge adapted using the anaerobic-only cycles.
5926,Anaerobic and aerobic periods of around 34 and 22 hours respectively resulted in an effluent with chemical oxygen demand (COD) and color content which met the standards for discharge into the centralized wastewater treatment plant of the industrial estate in which the dyeing factory was situated.
5927,"Neutralization of the real dyeing wastewater and addition of carbon source to it, both of which results in significant increase in the cost of the bacterial treatment process, was not found to be necessary to achieve the required discharge standards.Weathering processes change properties and composition of spilled oil, representing the main reason of failure of bioaugmentation strategies."
5928,Our purpose was to investigate the metabolic adaptation of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria at harsh conditions to be considered to overcome the limitations of bioaugmentation strategies at harsh conditions.
5929,"Polluted soils, exposed for prolonged periods to weathered oil in harsh soils and weather conditions, were used."
5930,Two types of enrichment cultures were employed using 5% and 10% oil or diesel as sole carbon sources with varying the mineral nitrogen sources and C/N ratios.
5931,"The most effective isolates were obtained based on growth, tolerance to toxicity, and removal efficiency of diesel hydrocarbons."
5932,"Activities of the newly isolated bacteria, in relation to the microenvironment from where they were isoalted and their interaction with the weathered oil, showed individual specific ability to adapt when exposed to such factors, to acquire metabolic potentialities."
5933,"Among 39 isolates, ten identified ones by 16S rDNA genes similarities, including special two <i>Pseudomonas</i> isolates and one <i>Citrobacter</i> isolate, showed particularity of shifting hydrocarbon-degrading ability from short chain <i>n</i>-alkanes (<i>n</i>-C12-<i>n</i>-C16) to longer chain <i>n</i>-alkanes (<i>n</i>-C21-<i>n</i>-C25) and vice versa by alternating nitrogen source compositions and C/N ratios."
5934,"This is shown for the first time.In this study, the bacterial strain Citrobacter youngae strain E4 was isolated from 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT)-contaminated soil and used to assess the capacity of TNT transformation with/without exogenous nutrient amendments."
5935,"C. youngae E4 poorly degraded TNT without an exogenous amino nitrogen source, whereas the addition of an amino nitrogen source considerably increased the efficacy of TNT transformation in a dose-dependent manner."
5936,"The enhanced TNT transformation of C. youngae E4 was mediated by increased cell growth and up-regulation of TNT nitroreductases, including NemA, NfsA and NfsB."
5937,This result indicates that the increase in TNT transformation by C. youngae E4 via nitrogen nutrient stimulation is a cometabolism process.
5938,"Consistently, TNT transformation was effectively enhanced when C. youngae E4 was subjected to a TNT-contaminated soil slurry in the presence of an exogenous amino nitrogen amendment."
5939,"Thus, effective enhancement of TNT transformation via the coordinated inoculation of the nutrient-responsive C. youngae E4 and an exogenous nitrogen amendment might be applicable for the remediation of TNT-contaminated soil."
5940,"Although the TNT transformation was significantly enhanced by C. youngae E4 in concert with biostimulation, the 96-h LC50 value of the TNT transformation product mixture on the aquatic invertebrate Tigriopus japonicas was higher than the LC50 value of TNT alone."
5941,"Our results suggest that exogenous nutrient amendment can enhance microbial TNT transformation; however, additional detoxification processes may be needed due to the increased toxicity after reduced TNT transformation.Previous study concerning the effects of surfactants on phenanthrene biodegradation focused on observing the changes of cell characteristics of Sphingomonas sp."
5942,GY2B.
5943,"However, the impact of surfactants on the expression of bacterial proteins, controlling phenanthrene transport and catabolism, remains obscure."
5944,"To overcome the knowledge gap, comparative proteomic approaches were used to investigate protein expressions of Sphingomonas sp."
5945,"GY2B during phenanthrene biodegradation in the presence and absence of a nonionic surfactant, Tween80."
5946,A total of 23 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated proteins were detected upon Tween80 treatment.
5947,Tween80 could regulate ion transport (e.g.
5948,H<sup>+</sup>) in cell membrane to provide driving force (ATP) for the transmembrane transport of phenanthrene thus increasing its uptake and biodegradation by GY2B.
5949,"Moreover, Tween80 probably increased GY2B vitality and growth by inducing the expression of peptidylprolyl isomerase to stabilize cell membrane, increasing the abundances of proteins involved in intracellular metabolic pathways (e.g."
5950,"TCA cycle), as well as decreasing the abundances of translation/transcription-related proteins and cysteine desulfurase, thereby facilitating phenanthrene biodegradation."
5951,This study may facilitate a better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate surfactants-enhanced biodegradation of PAHs at the proteomic level.Pump-and-treat strategies for groundwater containing explosives may be necessary when the contaminated water approaches sensitive receptors.
5952,"This project investigated bacterial photosynthesis as a strategy for ex situ treatment, using light as the primary energy source to facilitate RDX transformation."
5953,The objective was to characterize the ability of photosynthetic Rhodobacter sphaeroides (strain ATCC(\xc2\xae) 17023 \xe2\x84\xa2) to transform the high-energy explosive RDX.
5954,"R.\xc2\xa0sphaeroides transformed 30\xc2\xa0\xce\xbcM RDX within 40\xc2\xa0h under light conditions; RDX was not fully transformed in the dark (non-photosynthetic conditions), suggesting that photosynthetic electron transfer was the primary mechanism."
5955,"Experiments with RDX demonstrated that succinate and malate were the most effective electron donors for photosynthesis, but glycerol was also utilized as a photosynthetic electron donor."
5956,RDX was transformed irrespective of the presence of carbon dioxide.
5957,"The electron shuttling compound anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) increased transformation kinetics in the absence of CO2, when the cells had excess NADPH that needed to be re-oxidized because there was limited CO2 for carbon fixation."
5958,"When CO2 was added, the cells generated more biomass, and AQDS had no stimulatory effect."
5959,"End products indicated that RDX carbon became CO2, biomass, and a soluble, uncharacterized aqueous metabolite, determined using (14)C-labeled RDX."
5960,These data are the first to suggest that photobiological explosives transformation is possible and will provide a framework for which phototrophy can be used in environmental restoration of explosives contaminated water.
5961,"In this study, animal fleshing (ANFL) was utilized as a substrate for the production of extracellular protease by Clostridium limosum through central composite rotatable design (CCRD) and response surface methodology (RSM)."
5962,"Optimum protease production of 433U/ml was achieved and the purified enzyme was identified as acidic metalloprotease, a monomeric protein."
5963,"The molecular weight of the enzyme was 71kDa, whose activity was enhanced by bivalent metals such as Zn(2+) and Mg(2+)."
5964,Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination also revealed the hydrolysis/microbial degradation of ANFL through protease activity in the anaerobic fermentation process.
5965,Simultaneous hydrolysis of ANFL and production of an enzyme with the potential for different industrial applications provide an attractive methodology for the disposal of tannery solid waste.
5966,Elevated arsenic concentration in the environment and agricultural soil is a serious concern to crop production and human health.
5967,"Among different detoxification mechanisms, the methylation of arsenic is a widespread phenomenon in nature."
5968,"A number of microorganisms are able to methylate arsenic, but less is known about the arsenic metabolism in fungi."
5969,"We identified a novel arsenic methyltransferase (WaarsM) gene from a soil fungus, Westerdykella aurantiaca."
5970,WaarsM showed sequence homology with all known arsenic methyltransferases having three conserved SAM binding motifs.
5971,"The expression of WaarsM enhanced arsenic resistance in E. coli (\xce\x94ars) and S. cerevisiae (\xce\x94acr2) strains by biomethylation and required endogenous reductants, preferably GSH, for methyltransferase activity."
5972,"The purified WaarsM catalyzes the production of methylated arsenicals from both AsIII and AsV, and also displays AsV reductase activity."
5973,"It displayed higher methyltransferase activity and lower KM 0.1945 \xc2\xb1 0.021 mM and KM 0.4034 \xc2\xb1 0.078 mM for AsIII and AsV, respectively."
5974,"S. cerevisiae (\xce\x94acr2) cells expressing WaarsM produced 2.2 ppm volatile arsenic and 0.64 ppm DMA(v) with 0.58 ppm volatile arsenicals when exposed to 20 ppm AsV and 2 ppm AsIII, respectively."
5975,Arsenic tolerance in rice after co-culture with genetically engineered yeast suggested its potential role in arsenic bioremediation.
5976,"Thus, characterization of WaarsM provides a potential strategy to reduce arsenic concentration in soil with reduced arsenic accumulation in crops grown in arsenic contaminated areas, and thereby alleviating human health risks.A rhizobial strain, Sinorhizobium meliloti NM, could use 3,3\',4,4\'-tetrachloro-biphenyl (PCB 77) as the sole carbon and energy source for growth in mineral salt medium."
5977,The degradation efficiency of PCB 77 by strain NM and the bacterial growth increased with a decrease in PCB 77 concentration (5-0.25mgL(-1)).
5978,"The addition of secondary carbon sources, phenolic acids and one surfactant influenced PCB 77 degradation, rhizobial growth and biofilm formation."
5979,The highest degradation efficiency was observed in the presence of caffeic acid.
5980,Benzoate and chloride ions were detected as the PCB 77 metabolites.
5981,The up-regulation of benzoate metabolism-related gene expression was also observed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
5982,"This report is the first to demonstrate Sinorhizobium using coplanar tetrachlorobiphenyl as a sole carbon and energy source, indicating the potential wide benefit to the field of rhizobia-assisted bioremediation."
5983,Fluoranthene is highly toxic and ubiquitous in the environment.
5984,"A study on degradation of 200 ppm of fluoranthene in MSM by two bacterial strains Pseudomonas aeruginosa PSA5, Rhodococcus sp."
5985,NJ2 and their consortium revealed that fluoranthene was degraded 74% by Rhodococcus sp.
5986,"NJ2, 61% by Pseudomonas sp."
5987,PSA5 and 97% by their consortium.
5988,Higher degradation in the consortium may be attributed to synergistic action between two bacteria.
5989,"It was also observed that several degradative enzymes catechol 1,2 dioxygenase, catechol 2,3 dioxygenase, protocatechuate 2,3 dioxygenase, protocatechuate 3,4 dioxygenase, protocatechuate 4,5 dioxygenase, salicylate hydroxylase and 2-carboxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase were differentially induced at different stages of fluoranthene degradation."
5990,Biodegradation kinetics indicated half life period of fluoranthene degradation.
5991,"Besides, glycolipid, as a biosurfactant, was induced to facilitate the degradation process."
5992,"Hence, both the bacteria may be used individually or in combination for effective decontamination of oil and sludge contaminated soil.The influence of natural organic matter (NOM) on the transformation of acetaminophen in laccase-mediated oxidative coupling systems was investigated in this study."
5993,"It was found that the removal of acetaminophen was enhanced while the self-coupling of acetaminophen was suppressed in the presence of dissolved NOM, likely resulting from cross-coupling between dissolved NOM and acetaminophen."
5994,"In additionto cross-coupling with acetaminophen, NOM moieties could couple to each other upon reaction with laccase."
5995,This was evidenced by the development of a characteristic absorbance band centered at 472 nm.
5996,"According to the rate of the absorbance change at 472 nm, the NOM coupling reactions in four different NOM solutions were evaluated."
5997,"Apparently, the tendency of NOM coupling reactions correlates with the tendency of acetaminophen cross coupling with NOM in these solutions."
5998,"Possible reaction pathways of cross-coupling were explored using guaiacol as a model NOM proxy, and the products were extracted and analyzed with mass spectrometry (MS)."
5999,The results suggested that acetaminophen and guaiacol molecules were cross-coupled via the formation of C-O-C bonds.This study aimed to determine nicotine biodegradation and the genotoxic potential of nicotine and its degradation products during the process of tobacco waste composting.
6000,"Composting was carried out using two methods, i.e."
6001,the addition of 20% (bioreactor A) or 40% tobacco wastes to sewage sludge (bioreactor B) and control--sewage sludge (bioreactor C).
6002,Wheat straw was used as a structure-forming material.
6003,"As a result of composting the contents of C and N in the bioreactors changed, the C:N ratio in bioreactor A changed from 22.8 to 13.00, and that in bioreactor B changed from 23.5 to 12.00."
6004,"After composting, the biodegradation rate of nicotine was 78% in bioreactor A and 80% in bioreactor B, respectively."

6010,Sequential reactions using two xylan-backbone degrading enzymes (xylanase/beta-xylosidase) and two debranching enzymes (alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase/acetyl esterase) were also determined.
6011,"The highest degree of synergy was obtained in sequential reactions with the debranching enzyme digestion preceding the xylan-backbone degrading enzymes.The article concerns the influence of selected alkyl polyglucosides on biodegradation, cell surface and enzymatic properties of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Achromobacter denitrificans."
6012,The biodegradation of diesel oil depends on several factors including type and the amount of surfactant as well as bacterial genera used in the process.
6013,"Nevertheless, a careful selection of these variables must be made as some bacterial strains prefer to use surfactants as their carbon source."
6014,This leads to the lowered biodegradation of diesel oil as can be observed for the tested S. maltophilia strain.
6015,Alkyl polyglucosides influenced the cell surface properties of both of the tested strains in slightly different ways.
6016,"Especially for A. denitrificans, for which the hydrophobicity increased with concentration of both--Lutensol GD 70 and Glucopon 215 in diesel oil-surfactant systems."

6031,"After a first oxidation step leading to catechol in mesophilic and thermophilic microorganisms, two main routes have been identified depending on the cleavage of the aromatic ring: ortho involving a catechol 1,2 dioxygenase (C12D) and meta involving a catechol 2,3 dioxygenase (C23D)."
6032,Our work aimed at elucidating the phenol-degradation pathway in the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus 98/2.
6033,"For this purpose, the strain was cultivated in a fermentor under different substrate and oxygenation conditions."
6034,"Indeed, reducing dissolved-oxygen concentration allowed slowing down phenol catabolism (specific growth and phenol-consumption rates dropped 55% and 39%, respectively) and thus, evidencing intermediate accumulations in the broth."
6035,"HPLC/Diode Array Detector and LC-MS analyses on culture samples at low dissolved-oxygen concentration (DOC \xe2\x80\x8a=\xe2\x80\x8a 0.06 mg x L(-1)) suggested, apart for catechol, the presence of 2-hydroxymuconic acid, 4-oxalocrotonate and 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate, three intermediates of the meta route."
6036,RT-PCR analysis on oxygenase-coding genes of S. solfataricus 98/2 showed that the gene coding for the C23D was expressed only on phenol.
6037,"In 2D-DIGE/MALDI-TOF analysis, the C23D was found and identified only on phenol."
6038,"This set of results allowed us concluding that S. solfataricus 98/2 degrade phenol through the meta route.Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) show different degradation velocities by the lipolytic enzyme pancreatic lipase as a function of their composition (lipid matrix, stabilizing surfactant)."
6039,In combination with pancreatic colipase a degradation assay has been developed for studying the degradation behavior.
6040,As a measure to follow the degradation the formed free fatty acids have been analyzed using an enzymatic test.
6041,In the studies SLN degradation showed dependencies in relation to the length of the fatty acid chains in the triglycerides and the surfactants used for SLN production.
6042,"The longer the fatty acid chains in the glycerides, the slower the degradation."
6043,The influence of surfactants can be degradation accelerating (e.g.
6044,"cholic acid sodium salt) or a hindering, degradation slowing down effect due to steric stabilization (e.g."
6045,Poloxamer 407).
6046,"As a second steric stabilizer, Tween 80 has been used and the results showed a less pronounced effect on hindering the degradation process than for Poloxamer 407."
6047,This result seems to be correlated to the number of ethyleneoxide chains in the molecule.
6048,"The longer the ethyleneoxide chains are in the molecule, the more hindered is the anchoring of the lipase/colipase complex and consequently the degradation of the SLN."
6049,The result can be used to adjust degradation of SLN and consequently drug release in a controlled way.High-performance MS instrumentation coupled with improved protein extraction techniques enables metaproteomics to identify active members of soil and groundwater microbial communities.
