However, when m-cresol was the growth substrate, similar experiments suggested a different pathway involving a methyl-substituted catechol, and ring-fission by meta cleavage. Assays of ring-fission enzymes in cell-free extracts confirmed that different pathways are induced by the two growth substrates. 3, 5-Xylenol-grown cells contained high levels of \\tO\\ngentisate oxygenase\\tenzyme\\n and only very small amounts of \\tO\\ncatechol oxygenase\\tenzyme\\n, whereas gentisate ocygenase could not be detected in m-cresol-grown cells, but levels of \\tO\\ncatechol oxygenase\\tenzyme\\n were greatly increased. Extracts of m-cresol-grown cells also contained \\tO\\n2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase\\tenzyme\\n and hydrolase, whose specificities enable them to metabolize the ring-fission products from catechol, 3-methylcatechol, and 4-methylcatechol. This catechol pathway is also used by m-cresol-grown cells for p-cresol metabolism.

Trichloroethene (TCE) could be reductively dechlorinated to ethene with up to 95% efficiency as long as the pH-increase effects of methanogens and homoacetogens were managed and dechlorinators were selected for during start-up by creating H(2) limitation. Based on quantitative PCR, the dominant bacterial groups in the biofilm at the end of reactor operation were Dehalococcoides, Geobacter, and homoacetogens. Pyrosequencing confirmed the dominance of the dechlorinators and identified Acetobacterium as the key homoacetogen. Homoacetogens outcompeted methanogens for bicarbonate, based on the effluent concentration of acetate, by suppressing methanogens during batch start-up. This was corroborated by the methanogenesis functional gene mcrA, which was 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than the \\tO\\nFTHFS\\tgene\\n functional gene for homoacetogens. Imaging of the MBfR fibers using scanning electron microscopy showed a distinct Dehalococcoides-like morphology in the fiber biofilm. These results support that direct addition of H(2) can allow for efficient and complete reductive dechlorination, and they shed light into how H(2)-fed biofilms, when operated to manage methanogenic and homoacetogenic activity, can be used for ex-situ bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

DPA formation from phenanthrene was somewhat greater in low-nitrogen (ligninolytic) cultures than in high-nitrogen (nonligninolytic) cultures and did not occur in uninoculated cultures. The oxidation of PQ to DPA involved both fungal and abiotic mechanisms, was unaffected by the level of nitrogen added, and was significantly faster than the cleavage of phenanthrene to DPA. Phenanthrene-trans-9,10-dihydrodiol, which was previously shown to be the principal phenanthrene metabolite in nonligninolytic P. chrysosporium cultures, was not formed in the ligninolytic cultures employed here. These results suggest that phenanthrene degradation by ligninolytic P. chrysosporium proceeds in order from phenanthrene----PQ----DPA, involves both ligninolytic and nonligninolytic enzymes, and is not initiated by a classical microsomal cytochrome P-450. The extracellular \\tO\\nlignin peroxidase\\tenzyme\\ns of P. chrysosporium were not able to oxidize phenanthrene in vitro and therefore are also unlikely to catalyze the first step of phenanthrene degradation in vivo.

In a first screening, 18 different compounds were tested for degradation with the cultures as well as with four pure methane-oxidizing bacterial (MOB) strains. The tested compounds included pharmaceuticals, chemical additives, pesticides, and their degradation products. All enriched cultures were successful in the degradation of at least four different pollutants, but the compounds degraded most often were sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and benzotriazole (BTZ). Addition of acetylene, a specific \\tO\\nmethane monooxygenase\\tenzyme\\n (MMO) inhibitor, revealed that SMX and BTZ were mainly degraded co-metabolically by the present MOB. The pure MOB cultures exhibited less degradation potential, while SMX and BTZ were also degraded by three of the four tested pure strains. For MOB, copper (Cu(2+)) concentration is often an important factor, as several species have the ability to express a soluble MMO (sMMO) if the Cu(2+) concentration is low. In literature, this enzyme is often described to have a broader compound range for co-metabolic degradation of pollutants, in particular when it comes to aromatic structures.

The organism contains \\tO\\n2-aminobenzoate-coenzyme A ligase\\tenzyme\\n (\\tO\\n2-aminobenzoate-CoA ligase\\tenzyme\\n), which forms 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA. 2-Aminobenzoyl-CoA is then reductively deaminated to benzoyl-CoA by an oxygen-sensitive enzyme, 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA reductase (deaminating), which requires a low potential reductant [Ti(III)]. The specific activity is 15 nmol of 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA reduced min-1 mg-1 of protein at an optimal pH of 7. The two enzymes are induced by the substrate under anaerobic conditions only. Benzoyl-CoA is further converted in vitro by reduction with Ti(III) to six products; the same products are formed when benzoyl-CoA or 2-aminobenzoyl-CoA is incubated under reducing conditions. Two of them were identified preliminarily. One product is cyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA, the other is trans-2-hydroxycyclohexane-carboxyl-CoA. The complex transformation of benzoyl-CoA is ascribed to at least two enzymes, \\tO\\nbenzoyl-CoA reductase\\tenzyme\\n (aromatic ring reducing) and \\tO\\ncyclohex-1-enecarboxyl-CoA hydratase\\tenzyme\\n. The reduction of benzoyl-CoA to alicyclic compounds is catalyzed by extracts from cells grown anaerobically on either 2-aminobenzoate or benzoate at almost the same rate (10 to 15 nmol min-1 mg-1 of protein). In contrast, extracts from cells grown anaerobically on acetate or grown aerobically on benzoate or 2-aminobenzoate are inactive. This suggests a sequential induction of the enzymes.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

Slow-release inoculation of Sphingomonas sp. gamma 1-7 was established in both liquid and soil slurry microcosms using open-ended silicone tubes in which the bacteria are encapsulated in a protective nutrient-rich matrix. The capacity of the encapsulated cells to degrade lindane under aerobic conditions was evaluated in comparison with inoculation of free-living cells. Encapsulation of cells in tubes caused the removal of lindane by adsorption to the silicone tubes but also ensured prolonged biodegradation activity. Lindane degradation persisted 2.2 and 1.4 times longer for liquid and soil slurry microcosms, respectively, than that for inoculation with free cells. While inoculation of free-living cells led to a loss in lindane-degrading activity in limited time intervals, encapsulation in tubes allowed for a more stable actively degrading community. The loss in degrading activity was linked to the loss of the \\tO\\nlinA\\tgene\\n gene, encoding gamma-\\tO\\nHCH dehydrochlorinase\\tenzyme\\n (\\tO\\nLinA\\tgene\\n), which is involved in the initial steps of the lindane degradation pathway.

All MerAs have a C-terminal extension about 15 residues long but have very varied N termini. Although the enzyme from Streptomyces lividans has no addition, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Tn501 and Bacillus sp. strain RC607 it has one and two copies respectively of a domain of 80-85 residues, highly homologous to MerP, the periplasmic component of proteins encoded by the mer operon. These domains can be proteolytically cleaved off without changing the catalytic efficiency. We report here the crystal structure of \\tO\\nMerA\\tgene\\n from the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus sp. strain RC607. Analysis of its complexes with nicotinamide dinucleotide substrates and the inhibitor Cd(II) reveals how limited structural changes enable an enzyme to accept as substrate what used to be a dangerous inhibitor.

Notwithstanding, the potential effects on soil ecosystems remain largely unexplored. In this study, the effects of polyethylene microplastics on soil enzymatic activities and the bacterial community were evaluated, and the microbiota colonizing on microplastics were also investigated. Microplastic amendment (2000 fragments per kg soil) significantly increased the \\tO\\nurease\\tenzyme\\n and \\tO\\ncatalase\\tenzyme\\n activities in soil after 15 days, and no discernible alteration of \\tO\\ninvertase\\tenzyme\\n activities was detected. Results from high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA revealed that the alpha diversities (richness, evenness, and diversity) of the microbiota in soil were not obviously changed by the PE amendment, whereas the diversity indexes of microbiota on plastic fragments were significantly lower than those in the control and amended soils. Different taxonomic composition was observed in between the control and amended soils after 90 days of incubation. Bacterial assemblages with distinct community structure colonized the PE microplastics. Additionally, several taxa including plastic-degrading bacteria and pathogens were more abundant on microplastics. Simultaneously, the predicted functional profiles showed that the pathways of amino acid metabolism and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism were higher on the microplastics. These results indicated that microplastics in soil, compared with those in aquatic environments, can also act as a distinct microbial habitat, potentially altering the ecological functions of soil ecosystems.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

The proposed pathway initiates with hydrolysis of linuron to 3,4-dichloroaniline (DCA) and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine, followed by conversion of DCA to Krebs cycle intermediates. Differential proteomic analysis showed a linuron-dependent upregulation of several enzymes that fit into this pathway, including an \\tO\\namidase\\tenzyme\\n (\\tO\\nLibA\\tgene\\n), a multicomponent chloroaniline dioxygenase, and enzymes associated with a modified chlorocatechol ortho-cleavage pathway.

This novel member of the \\tO\\namidase\\tenzyme\\n signature family is unrelated to phenylurea-hydrolyzing enzymes from Gram-positive bacteria and lacks activity toward other tested phenylurea herbicides. Orthologues of \\tO\\nlibA\\tgene\\n are present in all other tested linuron-degrading Variovorax strains with the exception of Variovorax strains WDL1 and PBS-H4, suggesting divergent evolution of the linuron catabolic pathway in different Variovorax strains.

Transcription analysis suggests that a catabolic intermediate, rather than linuron itself, acts as effector in activation of the pathway.

The cell extract was fractionated into two DCP-dechlorinating activities (fractions Ia and Ib) and two ECH-hydrolyzing activities (fractions IIa and IIb) by TSKgel DEAE-5PW column chromatography. Fractions Ia and Ib catalyzed the interconversion of DCP to ECH, and fractions IIa and IIb catalyzed the transformation of ECH into MCP. Fractions Ia and IIa showed only low enantioselectivity for each reaction, whereas fractions Ib and IIb exhibited considerable enantioselectivity, yielding R-rich ECH and MCP, respectively. Enzymes Ia and Ib were isolated from fractions Ia and Ib, respectively. Enzyme Ia had a molecular mass of about 108 kDa and consisted of four subunits identical in molecular mass (about 28 kDa). Enzyme Ib was a protein of 115 kDa, composed of two different polypeptides (about 35 and 32 kDa). The specific activity of enzyme Ib for DCP was about 30-fold higher than that of enzyme Ia. Both enzymes catalyzed the transformation of several halohydrins into the corresponding epoxides with liberation of halides and its reverse reaction.

Although certain PAHs are oxidized in vitro by the fungal \\tO\\nlignin peroxidase\\tenzyme\\ns (LiPs) that catalyze ligninolysis, it has never been shown that LiPs initiate PAH degradation in vivo. To address these problems, the metabolism of anthracene (AC) and its in vitro oxidation product, 9,10-anthraquinone (AQ), was examined by chromatographic and isotope dilution techniques in Phanerochaete chrysosporium. The fungal oxidation of AC to AQ was rapid, and both AC and AQ were significantly mineralized. Both compounds were cleaved by the fungus to give the same ring-fission metabolite, phthalic acid, and phthalate production from AQ was shown to occur only under ligninolytic culture conditions. These results show that the major pathway for AC degradation in Phanerochaete proceeds AC----AQ----phthalate + CO2 and that it is probably mediated by LiPs and other enzymes of ligninolytic metabolism.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

The most purified preparation showed a single protein band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide disc gel electrophoresis with a molecular weight of 38,000. The apparent molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by Sephadex G-200 column chromatography was 150,000. Among the substrate analogs tested, only 4-hydroxyphthalate served as a substrate, which was decarboxylated to form m-hydroxybenzoate. The apparent Km values for 4,5-dihydroxyphthalate and 4-hydroxyphthalate were estimated to be 10.5 micrometer and 1.25 mM, respectively, and the Vmax for the former was 10 times larger than that for the latter.

The initial step of the pathway is hydroxylation of toluene to form p-cresol by a multicomponent \\tO\\ntoluene-4-monooxygenase\\tenzyme\\n (T4MO) system. The T4MO enzyme system has broad substrate specificity and provides a new opportunity for biodegradation of toxic compounds and bioconversions. Its known activities include conversion of a variety of phenyl compounds into the phenolic derivatives and the complete degradation of trichloroethylene. We have cloned and characterized a gene cluster from KR1 that determines the offO activity. To clone the T4MO genes, KR1 DNA libraries were constructed in Escherichia coli HB101 by using a broad-host-range vector and transferred to a KR1 mutant able to grow on p-cresol but not on toluene. An insert consisting of two SacI fragments of identical size (10.2 kb) was shown to complement the mutant for growth on toluene. One of the SacI fragments, when cloned into the E. coli vector pUC19, was found to direct the synthesis of indigo dye. The indigo-forming property was correlated with the presence of T4MO activity. The T4MO genes were mapped to a 3.6-kb region, and the direction of transcription was determined. DNA sequencing and N-terminal amino acid determination identified a five-gene cluster, \\tO\\ntmoABCDE\\tgene\\n, within this region. Expression of this cluster carrying a single mutation in each gene demonstrated that each of the five genes is essential for T4MO activity. Other evidence presented indicated that none of the tmo genes was involved in the regulation of the tmo gene cluster, in the control of substrate transport for the T4MO system, or in major processing of the products of the tmo genes. It was tentatively concluded that the \\tO\\ntmoABCDE\\tgene\\n genes encode structural polypeptides of the T4MO enzyme system.

Genetic studies have suggested that this monooxygenase consists of two different proteins, products of the \\tO\\nxylA\\tgene\\n and \\tO\\nxylM\\tgene\\n genes, which function as an electron-transfer protein and a terminal hydroxylase, respectively. In this study, the electron-transfer component of \\tO\\nxylene monooxygenase\\tenzyme\\n, the product of \\tO\\nxylA\\tgene\\n, was purified to homogeneity. Fractions containing the \\tO\\nxylA\\tgene\\n gene product were identified by its NADH:cytochrome c reductase activity. The molecular mass of the enzyme was determined to be 40 kDa by SDS/PAGE, and 42 kDa by gel filtration. The enzyme was found to contain 1 mol/mol of tightly but not covalently bound FAD, as well as 2 mol/mol of non-haem iron and 2 mol/mol of acid-labile sulfide, suggesting the presence of two redox centers, one FAD and one [2Fe-2S] cluster/protein molecule. The oxidised form of the protein had absorbance maxima at 457 nm and 390 nm, with shoulders at 350 nm and 550 nm. These absorbance maxima disappeared upon reduction of the protein by NADH or dithionite. The NADH:acceptor reductase was capable of reducing either one- or two-electron acceptors, such as horse heart cytochrome c or 2,6-dichloroindophenol, at an optimal pH of 8.5. The reductase was found to have a Km value for NADH of 22 microM. The oxidation of NADH was determined to be stereospecific; the enzyme is pro-R (class A enzyme). The titration of the reductase with NADH or dithionite yielded three distinct reduced forms of the enzyme: the reduction of the [2Fe-2S] center occurred with a midpoint redox potential of -171 mV; and the reduction of FAD to FAD. (semiquinone form), with a calculated midpoint redox potential of -244 mV. The reduction of FAD. to FAD.. (dihydroquinone form), the last stage of the titration, occurred with a midpoint redox potential of -297 mV. The [2Fe-2S] center could be removed from the protein by treatment with an excess of mersalyl acid. The [2Fe-2S]-depleted protein was still reduced by NADH, giving rise to the formation of the anionic flavin semiquinone observed in the native enzyme, thus suggesting that the electron flow was NADH --> FAD --> [2Fe-2S] in this reductase. The resulting protein could no longer reduce cytochrome c, but could reduce 2,6-dichloroindophenol at a reduced rate.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

This compound was shown to be the only major product formed from 3-fluoro-cis,cis-muconate by the action of \\tO\\nmuconate cycloisomerases\\tenzyme\\n from A. eutrophus 335, A. eutrophus JMP134, and P. cepacia as well as by the action of \\tO\\ndichloromuconate cycloisomerase\\tenzyme\\n from A. eutrophus JMP134. This finding implies that \\tO\\ndichloromuconate cycloisomerase\\tenzyme\\n, like the \\tO\\nmuconate cycloisomerases\\tenzyme\\n, catalyzes primarily a cycloisomerization reaction, which only in the case of chloro- and bromo-substituted substrates is connected to a dehalogenation. 4-Fluoromuconolactone at pH 7 decomposes by spontaneous reactions mainly to maleylacetate, which then decarboxylates to give cis-acetylacrylate. Although significant amounts of an unidentified compound are also formed from the fluorolactone, HF elimination to the two isomeric dienelactones (4-carboxymethylenebut-2-en-4-olides) is negligible. However, all spontaneous reactions proceed so slowly that an enzymatic conversion of 4-fluoromuconolactone must be assumed. Participation of \\tO\\ndienelactone hydrolases\\tenzyme\\n in this reaction is indicated by their induction during growth of various strains with 4-fluorobenzoate. However, experiments with cell extracts of P. putida A3.12 suggest that at least one other hydrolytic enzyme is able to contribute to 4-fluoromuconolactone conversion. In light of these observations, earlier proposals for a 4-fluorobenzoate degradative pathway are discussed.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

Enzyme stability is maintained by the addition of ethanol, EDTA, and dithiothreitol. Stoichiometric studies show that for 1 mol of undecyl acetate formed, 1 mol of O2 is consumed and 1 mol of NADPH is oxidized. The monooxygenase, purified to homogeneity, has a molecular weight of approximately 123,000 and consists of two equal subunits with molecular weights of 55,000. The enzyme contains FAD and exhibits absorption maxima at 375 and 488 nm. Enzyme activity is inhibited by thiol-active reagents and the inhibition by the cations, cadmium, copper, zinc, and mercury, is reversed by dithiothreitol, indicating the presence of essential sulfhydryl groups. Substrate specificity tests show that acetate esters are formed from methyl ketones from C-7 through C-14. The oxygenase is also active on isomers of 2-tridecanone forming esters from 3- through 7-tridecanone. With 6-tridecanone, two esters are formed, heptyl hexanoate and pentyl octanoate, indicating that oxygen is inserted on either side of the carbonyl group. In addition, the enzyme catalyzes the lactonization of the cyclic ketone, cyclopentanone, with the formation of 5-valerolactone.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

Atrazine is the most widely used s-triazine herbicide for the control of weeds in crops such as corn and sorghum. Although atrazine was initially found to be slowly and partially biodegradable, predominantly by nonspecific \\tO\\nP450 monoxygenase\\tenzyme\\ns which do not sustain microbial growth, microorganisms gradually evolved as a result of repeated exposure, started using it as a growth substrate and eventually succeeded in mineralizing it.

GY2B during phenanthrene biodegradation in the presence and absence of a nonionic surfactant, Tween80. A total of 23 up-regulated and 19 down-regulated proteins were detected upon Tween80 treatment. Tween80 could regulate ion transport (e.g. H+) in cell membrane to provide driving force (ATP) for the transmembrane transport of phenanthrene thus increasing its uptake and biodegradation by GY2B. Moreover, Tween80 probably increased GY2B vitality and growth by inducing the expression of \\tO\\npeptidylprolyl isomerase\\tenzyme\\n to stabilize cell membrane, increasing the abundances of proteins involved in intracellular metabolic pathways (e.g. TCA cycle), as well as decreasing the abundances of translation/transcription-related proteins and cysteine desulfurase, thereby facilitating phenanthrene biodegradation.

We employed three different cultural conditions: (1) a culture sequentially fed a high concentration (300 mg/L) of 2,4-D (HS); (2) a culture continuously fed a low concentration (10 mg/L) of 2,4-D (LC); and (3) a serial batch culture in which 1% (v/v) of culture was transferred to a fresh medium containing a high concentration (300 mg/L) of 2,4-D (HB). The HS and LC bioreactors were operated for 3 months and HB was repeatedly transferred for 1 month. The 2,4-D was stably degraded under all the cultural conditions tested. PCR amplification and cloning-based analysis of functional genes using community DNAs from the cultures revealed five different \\tO\\noxygenase\\tenzyme\\n genes that may be involved in the initial step of 2,4-D degradation. All five gene-types were present in HS, while one of the five genes, type V (\\tO\\ntftA\\tgene\\n) was not detected in LC. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that in HS, Ralstonia eutropha JMP 134 type-\\tO\\ntfdA4\\tgene\\n (type I) was the most abundant in copy number (2.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(7) copies/microg DNA) followed by RASC type-\\tO\\ntfdA\\tgene\\n (type II) (1.8 +/- 1.0 x 10(6) copies/microg DNA), putative \\tO\\ncadA\\tgene\\n-like gene (type IV) (2.6 +/- 0.8 x 10(5) copies/microg DNA), \\tO\\ncadA\\tgene\\n gene (type III) (1.3 +/- 1.0 x 10(4) copies/microg DNA), and \\tO\\ntftA\\tgene\\n gene (type V) (3.5 +/- 1.1 x 10(3) copies/microg DNA). Similar results were obtained in LC. In contrast, HB contained only type I and type III genes, and the type I gene was five orders of magnitude greater in copy number than the type III gene. Denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of PCR, amplified 16S rDNA fragments of bacterial communities in the three different cultures showed low similarity coefficient values (< or =0.35) when compared to the original activated sludge, suggesting that 2,4-D amendment caused a drastic change in the bacterial community. Particularly, HB showed only six bands (16-18 bands in the other cultures) and very low similarity coefficient values when compared to the other communities (0.10 to HS, 0.17 to LC, and 0.0 to original sludge). These results indicated that serial batch culturing (HB) resulted in a phylogenetically limited number of 2,4-D degrading bacteria carrying limited catabolic genes whereas more diverse 2,4-D degraders and catabolic genes were present in HS and LC. Therefore, the approach used for monitoring should be taken into account when one evaluates the population dynamics of contaminant-degrading bacteria at bioremediation sites.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

C. youngae E4 poorly degraded TNT without an exogenous amino nitrogen source, whereas the addition of an amino nitrogen source considerably increased the efficacy of TNT transformation in a dose-dependent manner. The enhanced TNT transformation of C. youngae E4 was mediated by increased cell growth and up-regulation of \\tO\\nTNT nitroreductase\\tenzyme\\ns, including NemA, NfsA and NfsB. This result indicates that the increase in TNT transformation by C. youngae E4 via nitrogen nutrient stimulation is a cometabolism process. Consistently, TNT transformation was effectively enhanced when C. youngae E4 was subjected to a TNT-contaminated soil slurry in the presence of an exogenous amino nitrogen amendment. Thus, effective enhancement of TNT transformation via the coordinated inoculation of the nutrient-responsive C. youngae E4 and an exogenous nitrogen amendment might be applicable for the remediation of TNT-contaminated soil. Although the TNT transformation was significantly enhanced by C. youngae E4 in concert with biostimulation, the 96-h LC50 value of the TNT transformation product mixture on the aquatic invertebrate Tigriopus japonicas was higher than the LC50 value of TNT alone. Our results suggest that exogenous nutrient amendment can enhance microbial TNT transformation; however, additional detoxification processes may be needed due to the increased toxicity after reduced TNT transformation.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

These observations suggested a major route of methylbenzoate metabolism to be dioxygenation to a carboxy-hydrodiol which then forms a catechol derivative. In addition, the methyl group of 2-methylbenzoate was oxidized to isobenzofuranone (by cells of MB2-G5) and to phthalate (by cells of a separate mutant that could not utilize phthalate, MB2-D2).

Here, the degradative pathway for atrazine was examined for a complex 8-membered enrichment culture. The species composition of the culture was determined by PCR-DGGE. The bacterial species included Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Caulobacter crescentus, Pseudomonas putida, Sphingomonas yaniokuyae, Nocardia sp., Rhizobium sp., Flavobacterium oryzihabitans, and Variovorax paradoxus. All of the isolates were screened for the presence of known genes that function for atrazine degradation including \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n,-B,-C,-D,-E,-F and \\tO\\ntrzD\\tgene\\n,-N. Dechlorination of atrazine, which was obligatory for complete mineralization, was carried out exclusively by Nocardia sp., which contained the trzN gene. Following dechlorination, the resulting product, hydroxyatrazine was further degraded via two separate pathways. In one pathway Nocardia converted hydroxyatrazine to N-ethylammelide via an unidentified gene product. In the second pathway, hydroxyatrazine generated by Nocardia sp. was hydrolyzed to N-isopropylammelide by Rhizobium sp., which contained the atzB gene. Each member of the enrichment culture contained \\tO\\natzC\\tgene\\n, which is responsible for ring cleavage, but none of the isolates carried the \\tO\\natzD\\tgene\\n,-E, or -F genes.

In aromatic compound-degrading anaerobic bacteria the central intermediate of aromatic catabolism, benzoyl coenzyme A, is attacked by dearomatizing \\tO\\nbenzoyl-CoA reductase\\tenzyme\\ns (BCRs). An ATP-dependent BCR has been characterized in facultative anaerobes. In contrast, a previous analysis of the soluble proteome from the obligately anaerobic model organism Geobacter metallireducens identified genes putatively coding for a completely different dearomatizing BCR. The corresponding BamBCDEFGHI complex is predicted to comprise soluble molybdenum or tungsten, selenocysteine, and FeS cluster-containing components. To elucidate key processes involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds in obligately anaerobic bacteria, differential membrane protein abundance levels from G. metallireducens grown on benzoate and acetate were determined by the MS-based spectral counting approach. A total of 931 proteins were identified by combining one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

Due to the increasing amount of rubber waste, biotechnical methods to degrade that particular waste are strongly needed. The present study evaluates whether a microbial or an enzymatic process is more suitable for efficient biodegradation, due to less sensitivity towards rubber additives. Therefore we investigated the impact of 15 different frequently used rubber additives on cells of the potent rubber degrader Gordonia polyisoprenivorans VH2 and the enzyme \\tO\\nLcp1VH2\\tenzyme\\n. For this, cells were grown on poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) in presence of these rubber additives. Furthermore, the effect of those additives on the enzymatic cleavage of poly(cis-1,4-isoprene) by \\tO\\nLcp1VH2\\tenzyme\\n was determined by in vitro studies. It was observed that additives, used to accelerate the vulcanization process, like N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide and zinc-bis(N,N-dibenzyl-dithiocarbamate), are diminishing the growth of the microorganism depending on their concentration-higher toxicity with increasing concentration. In contrast, sulfur prevents cell growth, but does not affect \\tO\\nLcp1VH2\\tenzyme\\n. Stearic acid and paraffin wax were found to be consumed by G. polyisoprenivorans VH2.

It was found that the in vitro degradation by \\tO\\nLcp1VH2\\tenzyme\\n is much more resistant and less sensitive towards the investigated rubber additives, when compared to the in vivo approach.

Bioremediation is an ecologically sound method to manage soil pollution, but the bottleneck here, is the successful scale-up of lab-scale experiments to field applications. This study demonstrates pilot-scale bioremediation in tropical soil using atrazine as model pollutant. Mimicking field conditions, three different bioremediation strategies for atrazine degradation were explored. 100 kg soil mesocosms were set-up, with or without atrazine application history. Natural attenuation and enhanced bioremediation were tested, where augmentation with an atrazine degrading consortium demonstrated best pollutant removal. 90% atrazine degradation was observed in six days in soil previously exposed to atrazine, while soil without history of atrazine use, needed 15 days to remove the same amount of amended atrazine. The bacterial consortium comprised of 3 novel bacterial strains with different genetic atrazine degrading potential. The progress of bioremediation was monitored by measuring the levels of atrazine and its intermediate, cyanuric acid.

The carcinogenic properties of PAHs are the main causes of harm to human health. The green technology, biodegradation have become convenient options to address the environmental pollution. In this study, we analyzed the biodegradation potential of naphthalene with secondary carbon supplements (SCSs) in carbon deficient media (CSM) by Pseudomonas putida strain KD9 isolated from oil refinerary waste. The rigid-flexible molecular docking method revealed that the mutated naphthalene \\tO\\n1,2-dioxygenase\\tenzyme\\n had lower affinity for naphthalene than that found in wild type strain. Moreover, analytical methods (HPLC, qRT-PCR) and soft agar chemotaxis suggest sucrose (0.5\\xe2\\x80\\xafwt%) to be the best chemo-attractant and it unequivocally caused enhanced biodegradation of naphthalene (500\\xe2\\x80\\xafmg\\xe2\\x80\\xafL-1) in both biofilm-mediated and shake-flask biodegradation methods. In addition, the morphological analysis detected from microscopy clearly showed KD9 to change its size and shape (rod to pointed) during biodegradation of naphthalene in CSM as sole source of carbon and energy. The forward versus side light scatter plot of the singlet cells obtained from flow cytometry suggests smaller cell size in CSM and lower florescence intensity of the total DNA content of cells.

The \\tO\\nhylA\\tgene\\n gene was identified in a draft genome sequence of strain WDL1. The involvement of \\tO\\nhylA\\tgene\\n in linuron degradation by strain WDL1 is inferred from its absence in spontaneous WDL1 mutants defective in linuron hydrolysis and its presence in linuron-degrading Variovorax strains that lack \\tO\\nlibA\\tgene\\n. In strain WDL1, the \\tO\\nhylA\\tgene\\n gene is combined with catabolic gene modules encoding the downstream pathways for DCA degradation, which are very similar to those present in Variovorax sp. SRS16, which contains \\tO\\nlibA\\tgene\\n. Our results show that the expansion of a DCA catabolic pathway toward linuron degradation in Variovorax can involve different but isofunctional linuron hydrolysis genes encoding proteins that belong to evolutionary unrelated hydrolase families. This may be explained by divergent evolution and the independent acquisition of the corresponding genetic modules.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

The pathways of atrazine biodegradation have been elucidated but in situ expression of the genes involved in atrazine degradation has yet to be demonstrated in soil. Expression of the \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n and \\tO\\natzD\\tgene\\n genes involved in atrazine dechlorination and s-triazine ring cleavage, respectively, was investigated during in situ degradation of atrazine in the soil drilosphere and bulked samples from two agricultural soils that differed in their ability to mineralize atrazine. Interestingly, expression of the \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n gene, although present in both soils, was not detected. Atrazine mineralization was greatest in Epoisses soil, where a larger pool of \\tO\\natzD\\tgene\\n mRNA was consistently measured 7 days after atrazine treatment, compared with Vezin soil (146 vs. 49 mRNA per 10(6)16S rRNA, respectively). Expression of the \\tO\\natzD\\tgene\\n gene varied along the degradation time course and was profoundly modified in soil bioturbated by earthworms. The \\tO\\natzD\\tgene\\n mRNA pool was the highest in the soil drilosphere (casts and burrow-linings) and it was significantly different in burrow-linings compared with bulk soil (e.g. 363 vs. 146 mRNA per 10(6)16S rRNA, 7 days after atrazine treatment in Epoisses soil). Thus, consistent differences in atrazine mineralization were demonstrated between the soil drilosphere and bulk soil. However, the impact of bioturbation on atrazine mineralization depended on soil type. Mineralization was enhanced in casts, compared with bulk soil, from Epoisses soil but in burrow-linings from Vezin soil. This study is the first to report the effects of soil bioturbation by earthworms on s-triazine ring cleavage and its spatial variability in soil.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

The bacterium Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP (P. ADP) possesses genes encoding atrazine mineralization on the self-transmissible plasmid pADP-1. In the present study, this ability of the strain to mineralize atrazine in aquifer sediment under both aerobic and denitrifying conditions at 10 degrees C was studied. P. ADP was able to mineralize more than 50% of 2.8 muM atrazine within 14 days under both growth conditions. Counts of degraders as colony forming units (CFU) on atrazine plates and counts of \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n gene copies as determined by quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction (cPCR) were performed. The \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n gene encodes the enzyme which catalyzes the first step of atrazine mineralization by the strain.

Y57 was isolated from the wastewater treatment system of an herbicide factory. Interestingly, this strain also showed the ability to degrade propanil (3,4-dichloropropionamilide). The present work reveals that Y57 degrades propanil via the following pathway: propanil was initially hydrolyzed to 3,4-dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) and then converted to 4,5-dichlorocatechol, which was then subjected to aromatic ring cleavage and further processing. N-acylation and N-deacylation of 3,4-DCA also occurred, and among N-acylation products, 3,4-dichloropropionanilide was found for the first time.

This case of biodegradation exemplifies the evolving catabolic capacity of bacteria, given that sulfonamide bacteriostatic are purely of synthetic origin.

Rather, metal ions appear to catalyze the heterolytic cleavage of peroxynitrite to form a nitronium-like species (NO2+). The calculated energy for separating peroxynitrous acid into hydroxide ion and nitronium ion is 13 kcal.mol-1 at pH 7.0. Fe3+EDTA catalyzed nitration with an activation energy of 12 kcal.mol-1 at a rate of 5700 M-1.s-1 at 37 degrees C and pH 7.5. The reaction rate of peroxynitrite with bovine Cu,Zn \\tO\\nsuperoxide dismutase\\tenzyme\\n was 10(5) M-1.s-1 at low \\tO\\nsuperoxide dismutase\\tenzyme\\n concentrations, but the rate of nitration became independent of \\tO\\nsuperoxide dismutase\\tenzyme\\n concentration above 10 microM with only 9% of added peroxynitrite yielding nitrophenol.

At high \\tO\\nsuperoxide dismutase\\tenzyme\\n concentrations, phenolic nitration may be limited by the rate of isomerization from the cis to trans conformations of peroxynitrite as well as by competing pathways for peroxynitrite decomposition.

It is a xenobiotic compound which has accumulated in the environment for more than 50 years due to its global industrial usage and can cause negative effects on the environment. Isophthalate degradation by the strictly anaerobic S. aromaticivorans was investigated to advance our understanding of the degradation of xenobiotics introduced into nature, and to identify enzymes that might have ecological significance for bioremediation. Differential proteome analysis of isophthalate- vs benzoate-grown cells revealed over 400 differentially expressed proteins of which only four were unique to isophthalate-grown cells. The isophthalate-induced proteins include a phenylacetate:\\tO\\nCoA ligase\\tenzyme\\n, a \\tO\\nUbiD-like decarboxylase\\tenzyme\\n, a \\tO\\nUbiX-like flavin prenyltransferase\\tenzyme\\n, and a hypothetical protein. These proteins are encoded by genes forming a single gene cluster that putatively codes for anaerobic conversion of isophthalate to benzoyl-CoA. Subsequently, benzoyl-CoA is metabolized by the enzymes of the anaerobic benzoate degradation pathway that were identified in the proteomic analysis. In vitro enzyme assays with cell-free extracts of isophthalate-grown cells indicated that isophthalate is activated to isophthalyl-CoA by an ATP-dependent isophthalate:\\tO\\nCoA ligase\\tenzyme\\n (IPCL), and subsequently decarboxylated to benzoyl-CoA by a \\tO\\nUbiD family isophthalyl-CoA decarboxylase\\tenzyme\\n (IPCD) that requires a prenylated flavin mononucleotide (prFMN) cofactor supplied by \\tO\\nUbiX\\tgene\\n to effect decarboxylation.

Homologs of the IPCD encoding genes are found in several other bacteria, such as aromatic compound-degrading denitrifiers, marine sulfate-reducers, and methanogenic communities in a terephthalate-degrading reactor.

Strain MSH1 Biofilms under Carbon Starvation Conditions.\\tO\\n\\nAbstract\\tO\\n\\nAminobacter sp. strain MSH1 grows on and mineralizes the groundwater micropollutant 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) and is of interest for BAM removal in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). The BAM-catabolic genes in MSH1 are located on plasmid \\tO\\npBAM1\\tgene\\n, carrying \\tO\\nbbdA\\tgene\\n, which encodes the conversion of BAM to 2,6-dichlorobenzoic acid (2,6-DCBA) (\\tO\\nBbdA\\tgene\\n+ phenotype), and plasmid \\tO\\npBAM2\\tgene\\n, carrying gene clusters encoding the conversion of 2,6-DCBA to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates (Dcba+ phenotype). There are indications that MSH1 easily loses its BAM-catabolic phenotype. We obtained evidence that MSH1 rapidly develops a population that lacks the ability to mineralize BAM when grown on nonselective (R2B medium) and semiselective (R2B medium with BAM) media. Lack of mineralization was explained by loss of the Dcba+ phenotype and corresponding genes. The ecological significance of this instability for the use of MSH1 for BAM removal in the oligotrophic environment of DWTPs was explored in lab and pilot systems. A higher incidence of \\tO\\nBbdA\\tgene\\n+ Dcba- MSH1 cells was also observed when MSH1 was grown as a biofilm in flow chambers under C and N starvation conditions due to growth on nonselective residual assimilable organic carbon. Similar observations were made in experiments with a pilot sand filter reactor bioaugmented with MSH1. BAM conversion to 2,6-DCBA was not affected by loss of the DCBA-catabolic genes. Our results show that MSH1 is prone to BAM-catabolic instability under the conditions occurring in a DWTP. While conversion of BAM to 2,6-DCBA remains unaffected, BAM mineralization activity is at risk, and monitoring of metabolites is warranted.IMPORTANCE Bioaugmentation of dedicated biofiltration units with bacterial strains that grow on and mineralize micropollutants was suggested as an alternative for treating micropollutant-contaminated water in drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). Organic-pollutant-catabolic genes in bacteria are often easily lost, especially under nonselective conditions, which affects the bioaugmentation success. In this study, we provide evidence that Aminobacter sp. strain MSH1, which uses the common groundwater micropollutant 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) as a C source, shows a high frequency of loss of its BAM-mineralizing phenotype due to the loss of genes that convert 2,6-DCBA to Krebs cycle intermediates when nonselective conditions occur. Moreover, we show that catabolic-gene loss also occurs in the oligotrophic environment of DWTPs, where growth of MSH1 depends mainly on the high fluxes of low concentrations of assimilable organic carbon, and hence show the ecological relevance of catabolic instability for using strain MSH1 for BAM removal in DWTPs.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

When intact cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 carrying DNA fragments encoding the first three enzymes of the pathway were incubated with naphthalene, they formed products of the dioxygenase-catalyzed ring cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene. These products were separated by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 and were identified by 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylate (HCCA) and trans-o-hydroxybenzylidenepyruvate (tHBPA). HCCA was detected as the first reaction product in these incubation mixtures by its characteristic UV spectrum, which slowly changed to a spectrum indicative of an equilibrium mixture of HCCA and tHBPA. Isomerization of either purified product occurred slowly and spontaneously to give an equilibrium mixture of essentially the same composition. tHBPA is also formed from HCCA by the action of an isomerase enzyme encoded by plasmid \\tO\\nNAH7\\tgene\\n. The gene encoding this enzyme, \\tO\\nnahD\\tgene\\n, was cloned on a 1.95-kb KpnI-BglII fragment. Extracts of Escherichia coli JM109 carrying this fragment catalyzed the rapid equilibration of HCCA and tHBPA. Metabolism of tHBPA to salicylaldehyde by hydration and aldol cleavage is catalyzed by a single enzyme encoded by a 1-kb MluI-StuI restriction fragment.

However, little is known about the key players involved in the process. Methanogenic hexadecane-degrading consortia were enriched from an oilfield (Shengli, China). The microbial dynamics during the transfer incubations were monitored using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting of 16S rRNA genes in combination with cloning and sequencing. The archaeal community shifted from a predominance of aceticlastic Methanosaeta during early cultivation to a substantial increase in hydrogenotrophic Methanoculleus in the highly enriched culture. Bacterial T-RFs 161 and 164 bp were consistently detected during the incubation and became dominant in the highly enriched culture. T-RF 161 bp primarily represented uncultured Waste Water of Evry 1 bacterium, which was possibly associated with Candidatus Cloacamonas acidaminovorans (99.7% sequence similarity). T-RF 164 bp could be assigned to both Thermotogaceae, with the closest relative being Candidatus Mesotoga sulfurreducens (similarity of 97%) and Syntrophaceae, with Smithella propionica as the closest relative (similarity of 96-97%).

The purified enzyme was homogeneous in disc electrophoresis, and the molecular weight was found to be approximately 80,000 by gel filtration. The enzyme catalyzed the following reaction: cyclohexylamine+O2+H2O leads to cyclohexanone+NH3+H2O2. The enzyme thus can be classified as an amine oxidase; it utilized oxygen as the ultimate electron acceptor. The pH optimum of the reaction was 6.8 and the apparent Km value for cyclohexylamine was 2.5 X 10(-4) M. The enzyme was highly specific for the deamination of alicyclic primary amines such as cyclohexylamine, but was found to be inactive toward ordinary amines used as substrates for amine oxidases. The enzyme solution was yellow in color and showed a typical flavoprotein spectrum; the addition of cyclohexylamine under anaerobic conditions caused reduction of the flavin in the native enzyme. The flavin of the prosthetic group was identified as FAD by thin layer chromatography. The participation of sulfhydryl groups in the enzymic action was also suggested by the observation that the enzyme activity was inhibited in the presence of PCMB and could be recovered by the addition of glutathione.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

The characterization of the site through 10 monitoring wells evidenced that leaked PCE was transformed to TCE and cis-DCE via hydrogenolysis. Carbon isotopic mass balance of chlorinated ethenes pointed to two distinct sources of contamination and discarded relevant alternate degradation pathways in the aquifer. Application of specific-genus primers targeting Dehalococcoides mccartyi species and the \\tO\\nvinyl chloride-to-ethene reductive dehalogenase\\tenzyme\\n \\tO\\nvcrA\\tgene\\n indicated the presence of autochthonous bacteria capable of the complete dechlorination of PCE. The observed cis-DCE stall was consistent with the aquifer geochemistry (positive redox potentials; presence of dissolved oxygen, nitrate, and sulphate; absence of ferrous iron), which was thermodynamically favourable to dechlorinate highly chlorinated ethenes but required lower redox potentials to evolve beyond cis-DCE to the innocuous end product ethene. Accordingly, the addition of lactate or a mixture of ethanol plus methanol as electron donor sources in parallel field-derived anoxic microcosms accelerated dechlorination of PCE and passed cis-DCE up to ethene, unlike the controls (without amendments, representative of field natural attenuation). Lactate fermentation produced acetate at near-stoichiometric amounts. The array of techniques used in this study provided complementary lines of evidence to suggest that enhanced anaerobic bioremediation using lactate as electron donor source is a feasible strategy to successfully decontaminate this site.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

When the soil was amended with nutrients, plasmid transfer and enhanced degradation of 2,4-D were observed. These findings were most striking in the B horizon, where the indigenous bacteria were unable to degrade any of the 2,4-D (100 mg/kg of soil) during at least 22 days but where inoculation with either of the two plasmid donors resulted in complete 2,4-D degradation within 14 days. In contrast, in soils not amended with nutrients, inoculation of donors in the A horizon and subsequent formation of transconjugants (10(5) CFU/g of soil) could not increase the 2,4-D degradation rate compared to that of the noninoculated soil. However, donor inoculation in the nonamended B-horizon soil resulted in complete degradation of 2,4-D within 19 days, while no degradation at all was observed in noninoculated soil during 89 days. With plasmid \\tO\\npEMT1\\tgene\\n, this enhanced degradation seemed to be due only to transconjugants (10(5) CFU/g of soil), since the donor was already undetectable when degradation started. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes showed that inoculation of the donors was followed by a shift in the microbial community structure of the nonamended B-horizon soils. The new 16S rRNA gene fragments in the DGGE profile corresponded with the 16S rRNA genes of 2,4-D-degrading transconjugant colonies isolated on agar plates. This result indicates that the observed change in the community was due to proliferation of transconjugants formed in soil. Overall, this work clearly demonstrates that bioaugmentation can constitute an effective strategy for cleanup of soils which are poor in nutrients and microbial activity, such as those of the B horizon.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

Tests for utilization of acyclic isoprenols such as citronellol and geraniol were complicated by toxic effects of these alcohols, and most species tested were killed by exposure to citronellol or geraniol (0.1%, vol/vol) in liquid culture. In the case of Pseudomonas citronellolis, sensitivity to isoprenols is reduced by prior induction of the isoprenoid degradative pathway via either growth on succinate in the presence of citronellol or growth on citronellic acid. For this species, citronellic acid proved to be the best isoprenoid growth substrate tested. Geraniol utilization as a taxonomic indicator for different subgroups of pseudomonads is discussed. Only a few of the species tested were able to utilize acyclic isoprenoids. Two species which utilize C10 acyclic isoprenoids, P. aeruginosa and P. mendocina, were shown to contain the inducible enzyme \\tO\\ngeranyl-coenzyme A carboxylase\\tenzyme\\n, one of the unique enzymes in the isoprenol degradative pathway known to occur in P. citronellolis.

However, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of sulfonylurea herbicide de-esterification are still unknown. In this study, a novel \\tO\\nesterase\\tenzyme\\n gene, \\tO\\nsulE\\tgene\\n, responsible for sulfonylurea herbicide de-esterification, was cloned from Hansschlegelia zhihuaiae S113. The gene contained an open reading frame of 1,194 bp, and a putative signal peptide at the N terminal was identified with a predicted cleavage site between Ala37 and Glu38, resulting in a 361-residue mature protein. \\tO\\nSulE\\tgene\\n minus the signal peptide was synthesized in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified to homogeneity. \\tO\\nSulE\\tgene\\n catalyzed the de-esterification of a variety of sulfonylurea herbicides that gave rise to the corresponding herbicidally inactive parent acid and exhibited the highest catalytic efficiency toward thifensulfuron-methyl. \\tO\\nSulE\\tgene\\n was a dimer without the requirement of a cofactor. The activity of the enzyme was completely inhibited by Ag(+), Cd(2+), Zn(2+), methamidophos, and sodium dodecyl sulfate. A \\tO\\nsulE\\tgene\\n-disrupted mutant strain, \\xce\\x94\\tO\\nsulE\\tgene\\n, was constructed by insertion mutation. \\xce\\x94\\tO\\nsulE\\tgene\\n lost the de-esterification ability and was more sensitive to the herbicides than the wild type of strain S113, suggesting that \\tO\\nsulE\\tgene\\n played a vital role in the sulfonylurea herbicide resistance of the strain. The transfer of \\tO\\nsulE\\tgene\\n into Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 conferred on it the ability to de-esterify sulfonylurea herbicides and increased its resistance to the herbicides. This study has provided an excellent candidate for the mechanistic study of sulfonylurea herbicide metabolism and detoxification through de-esterification, construction of sulfonylurea herbicide-resistant transgenic crops, and bioremediation of sulfonylurea herbicide-contaminated environments.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

The fate of these compounds in the environment is directly correlated with the ability of microbes to metabolize them. Microbes metabolize melamine and the triazine herbicides such as atrazine via enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions. Hydrolytic removal of substituents on the s-triazine ring is catalyzed by enzymes from the \\tO\\namidohydrolase\\tenzyme\\n superfamily and yields cyanuric acid as an intermediate.

In topsoil samples, (14)C-atrazine mineralization lag times decreased after atrazine application and increased with increasing time after atrazine application, suggesting that atrazine application resulted into the proliferation of atrazine mineralizing microbial populations which decayed when atrazine application stopped. Decay rates appeared however much slower than growth rates. Atrazine application also resulted into the increase of the atrazine mineralization potential in deeper layers which was explained by the growth on leached atrazine as measured in soil leachates recovered from that depth. However, no decay was observed during intermittent periods without atrazine application in the deeper soil layer. \\tO\\natzA\\tgene\\n and \\tO\\ntrzN\\tgene\\n gene quantification confirmed partly the growth and decay of the atrazine degrading populations in the soil and suggested that especially \\tO\\ntrzN\\tgene\\n bearing populations are the dominant atrazine degrading populations in both topsoil and deeper soil. Manure treatment only improved the atrazine mineralization rate in deeper soil layers. Our results point to the importance of the atrazine application history on a field and suggests that the long term survival of atrazine degrading populations after atrazine application enables them to rapidly proliferate once atrazine is again applied.\\tO\\n\\n',\n",

Here, the complete genome sequence of strain P73(T) is presented and analyzed. Besides a 4.5-Mb circular chromosome, strain P73(T) carries five plasmids, and encodes 4827 predicted protein-coding sequences. One hundred and thirty-eight genes, including 14 dioxygenase genes, were predicted to be involved in the degradation of aromatic compounds, and most of these genes are clustered in four regions. P73_0346 is the first \\tO\\nfluoranthene 7,8-dioxygenase\\tenzyme\\n to be discovered and the first \\tO\\nfluoranthene dioxygenase\\tenzyme\\n within the toluene/biphenyl family.

Malathion was used as a sole source of carbon (50 mg/l) to enumerate malathion degraders, which were designated as IS1, IS2, IS3, IS4, and IS5. They were identified, based on their morphological and biochemical characteristics, as Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Micrococcus lylae, Pseudomonas aureofaciens, and Acetobacter liquefaciens, respectively.

The 16S rRNA gene of IS1 shared 99% similarity with that of Alphaprotoebacterium BAL284, while IS2 scored 100% similarity with that of Pseudomonas putida 32zhy. Malathion residues almost completely disappeared within 6 days of incubation in IS2 liquid cultures.
